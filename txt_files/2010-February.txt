Dear Fareed

That depends very much on your location. In the US my guess judging on  
the number of users on this list it must be equest closely followed by  
Trace, energyplus or doe2 in some form or another.

For the rest of the world? Energyplus or Trace then IES virtual  
environment or Bentley TAS at a guess

The UK is heavily biased to the latter 2.

There are of course others but that'll be the main ones I'd have  
thought.

I would think that the response to this question would depend in part on what the purpose of your energy model is.  Are you talking about modeling to size mechanical equipment, modeling for the purpose of demonstrating compliance w/ LEED requirements, or predictive modeling meant to determine the actual anticipated energy consumption of a building?

Cheers,
Edgar

Hi Fareed,

as Edgar suggested it strongly depends on the system you are modelling.
Focussing on energy in buildings, for Belgium I would say either TRNSYS or
EnergyPlus. That at least for engineering offices and universities or
university colleges. For Germany and the Scandinavian countries my guess is
that IDA-ICE takes a large share of the market. Researchers in Scotland, the
Netherlands, Switzerland and Canada do use ESP-r as well.

Focussing on modelling things like hydraulics, these codes are less popular,
and I have seen researchers using EES or modellica for those cases.

Hope all these bits of information will help you out!

Technically both. Mostly, we do LEED projects and sometimes also do
energy analysis for system comparison based on annual operating costs.

 

Thanks,

Fareed,

start with defining what you want a code does for you. Than take the
document I attached and check out which code would work the best for you. I
did that and after 3 years of TRNSYS I changed to ESP-r and I really enjoyed
it!

Fareed,

 

We use IES, a program from Scotland, to do our energy analysis. We use
it as it's got a great use for IFC interfacing via gbXML to Revit. We
use many different architectural platforms and require them to all be
interoperable with each other, hence the IFC.

 

The program has just released a new version. I advise to at least trial
it. It has a large learning curve but not as much as the other softwares
(we've tried Energy+, MagiCad, & others). However, it does have a great
support team and is recognised as a valid energy, HVAC, PMV, CFD and
daylight analysis modules for our GreenStar submission process (LEED
equivalent in Australia).

Does anyone knows how to export an autocad file to .gbxml format?

 

Trace 700 has the option in which I can import .gbxml format and it will
create all the rooms based on the drawing. So I want to save time doing
area take-offs and creating rooms.

 

Thanks,

>    1. Re: Mostly commonly used energy analysis software? (Edgar Farrera)

If you consider the whole world and not just the US, your short list
should definitely include the Passive House Planning Package, which is
the only software which can be used to design Certified Passive House
projects, which meet the voluntary Passive House Standard
(www.passivehouse.com). This building envelope efficiency standard is
the toughest in the world, but its adoption is growing exponentially
(way more than 12,000) because it has the lowest lifecycle costs. In
Europe production builders have adopted it, mass producing these super
building envelopes as affordable housing and commercial projects, too.
It has revolutionized the building industry in Europe, both products,
and means & methods. We've yet to beat it - the first Passive House
entered in the Solar Decathlon on our National Mall won (2007), then in
2009 there were two Passive house entries, and they took 1st & 2nd
place. Time to join them.

In 2008, I was one of the first 13 Certified Passive House Consultants
trained in the USA (www.passivehouse.us). The PHPP software has the
advantage of being an Excel spreadsheet, which makes the formulas used
basically open source, unlike most energy modeling software created in
the USA. This really cuts down on the garbage in, garbage out phenomena.
I've used Equest, Energy Plus, Energy 10, and many smaller brands of
energy modeling, and PHPP is the only one I've found that is truly
designed to handle everything one might want to do in an ultra-low
energy building. The certification process for consultants and buildings
is also the most rigorous I've ever encountered - leaves LEED in the
dust. The annual conference is the most intensive state-of-the-art
building science learning experience you'll find.

Dear Christina,

Fair point about PhPP and Passivhaus being a very good design philosophy
that will work particularly well in temperate or colder climates (still not
entirely convinced that it would work well in hot humid climates), but I
would just pick you up on the fact that the PHPP tool uses Excel.  This
clearly means it isn't actually a building simulation tool, it is merely a
set of calculations.  Granted they are based on simulations and empirical
data which have been rigorously tested, but they are not by their very
nature dynamic at all.  Judging on the previous question from Fareed to
which this discussion was based, it was looking for advise on complex
simulation tools capable of very complex dynamic systems analysis.  Sorry,
I'm not trying to being antagonistic here, just being a little anal perhaps.


Actually, I do like the Passivhaus approach of very well insulated buildings
with minimal heating/cooling and energy usage as that in my own view is a
good starting point, though personally I have an issue with something
calling itself passive when it essentially stipulates a requirement for
mechanical ventilation albeit super efficient ventilation systems with heat
recovery, etc.  That is not passive, it is active therefore slightly
misleading in my own view.  I recall (though where from I can't remember)
that there were some problems with a case of a truly passivehouse being
litigated against because it advertised itself as a passivehouse yet wasn't
passivhaus certified because of the lack of active systems, a slightly odd
approach situation to me.  

Saying that, we recently carried out the dynamic simulations of the first
office block in the UK, fully built to the passivhaus standards and as you'd
expect, it is a very efficient building and therefore the approach has merit
in a much wider global context so it something people should consider,
particularly at concept/schematic design stages.

Kind Regards
Paul

Hello,
Does anyone know where I can find ambient CO2 concentrations for my local area (South Florida) in the U.S.?
I feel like this data should be really easy to find (isn't everyone measuring it these days?), but, I haven't had any luck finding readings on the web anywhere....other than the typical/average concentration listing for the U.S.  

If anyone knows where actual readings for various locations may be hidden on the EPA or other websites, I'd appreciate you pointing me in the right direction.  A link would be wonderful!

Thanks.
Julia

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Exterior Lighting Power Calculation for Building Facades
Message-ID: <005e01caa5b6$1aa062b0$4fe12810$@com>

Can anyone with experience showing compliance with ASHRAE 90.1-2004
section 9.4.5 enlighten me as how the baseline calculation should be done?




The confusion I?m having is with the definition of an illuminated wall or
surface length when applying the 5.0 W/linear foot allowance for building
fa?ades.  How is the lineal footage of an illuminated wall determined?



For example, if a 100? wide wall has one exterior lighting fixture on it
at the center, is the entire wall considered to be illuminated and thus
the baseline lighting power allowance is 500W?  Or is there some method of
determining the actual portion of the wall that is illuminated?



This came up on a LEED project where I had applied table 9.4.5 as
conservatively as possible and only considered a portion of the wall to be
illuminated at each fixture.



Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Dear listers,
I was doing a simulation using VE Ware plug-in for sketchup carbon footprint tool, and I am not a technically savvy user, just a dumb architectural designer...so I had a question.
 
All variables were the same between two scenarios, except for the HVAC type.  Under one scenario I was simulating a split mechanical system with mechanical cooling, and under the other I was simulating a waterloop heat pump (which I assume is the same as geothermal heat pump?), and the fuel source was electric.
 
The carbon footprint for the waterloop heat pump was greater than the split system with mechanical cooling.  I would've thought it would be the reverse.
 
Can someone explain this to me?  Any other comments on the carbon footprint tool for VE ware sketchup plugin?
 
Thanks so much for your time.

Robby,

My understanding is: since this is a non-tradable surface, base line and proposed design should be the same even though it is well below allowances.

Could someone come up with a solution for modeling a PoolPak unit?

The unit first cools the return air, then mixes it with outdoor air (through an economizer), reheat it if necessary before supplying to the pool area.
The reheat may come from the condensation of the refrigerant. Additionally, condensation of the refrigerant may provide heat for heating the water.

I already have the evaporation  rate from the pool.

Thanks,

Hi,
Does Ashrae Std 90.1-2007 impose any minimum performance criteria for
air-to-water heat pumps working as central hot water generators for
heating purposes?
In tables 6.8.1 I can only find minimum performance requirements for
air-to-air, water source, groundwater source and ground source heat
pumps, but nothing about air-to-water.
Thanks,

Weixiu,



The problem I am having is that I do not understand how to correctly 
calculate the baseline power allowance.  Part of the mandatory provisions of 
section 9.4.5 states that you cannot exceed the baseline exterior lighting 
power allowance with your proposed building.  By incorrectly calculating the 
baseline exterior lighting and showing this in my model the LEED reviewer 
has flagged my EAp2 credit for denial due to not complying with the 
mandatory provisions.



In short, I need to reply back with a corrected baseline lighting power 
allowance, which I am having trouble with due to the unclear definition of 
?illuminated wall?.

Robby,



My understanding is: since this is a non-tradable surface, base line and

Can anyone with experience showing compliance with ASHRAE 90.1-2004 section 
9.4.5 enlighten me as how the baseline calculation should be done?



The confusion I?m having is with the definition of an illuminated wall or 
surface length when applying the 5.0 W/linear foot allowance for building 
fa?ades.  How is the lineal footage of an illuminated wall determined?



For example, if a 100? wide wall has one exterior lighting fixture on it at 
the center, is the entire wall considered to be illuminated and thus the 
baseline lighting power allowance is 500W?  Or is there some method of 
determining the actual portion of the wall that is illuminated?



This came up on a LEED project where I had applied table 9.4.5 as 
conservatively as possible and only considered a portion of the wall to be 
illuminated at each fixture.



Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I would divide the 500 Watts by the entire 100 lineal feet of the wall the
fixture is on. I don't see what you would gain by just considering the lit
area of the wall but I can see where you might be penalized. Since it's just
an exterior load there aren't any interactive effects to worry about either.

Yes, due to the fact that I didn?t want to claim unfair credit over the
baseline I only considered a very small portion of the wall to be ?lit?.
This caused my baseline allowance to be lower than my proposed which set
off a red flag for the LEED reviewer due to Exterior Lighting Power
density being a mandatory provision of ASHRAE 90.1-2004.

Weixiu
Are you sure about your interpretation of the non-tradable surfaces. If I understand correctly what you are saying is that even though my proposed design uses less lighting power compared to the baseline for the non-tradable surfaces I cannot get an benefit from those savings.

 My understanding was that total of tradable and nontradable should be less than the overall allowance +5% additional unrestricted allowance.
Each category of tradable does not have to comply prescriptively and can be higher than base allowance in some cases and have increased savings in another. For example my overall lighting energy use can be higher for say parking area compared to the base allowance as long as I compensate that additional power by increased savings in another category say plaza area.
On the contrary one has to meet the prescriptive requirements for each category of non tradable surfaces and cannot exceed the allowance. Increased building fa?ade lighting cannot be compensated by reduced gatehouse inspection station lighting.

Can someone please confirm this.
In my model I have significant savings in non-tradable lighting and I have been modeling Ashrae allowance for non tradable area based on area being lit in base case and actually proposed design wattage and lighting power in the proposed case which is much lower.

Thanks

Ecotect has a lot of power for sun penetration studies and as a tool  
to export and then import into Radiance.  I wouldn't use it for  
thermal simulation (we use IES primarily  and DOE-2.2 occasionally).   
The stereographic shading diagrams are accurate, but the tabular data  
that is reported is incorrect when assessing Daylight Glare Control  
under Australia's Green Star.  This credit requires you to assess the  
portion of business hours a point 1.5m in from the facade and desk  
height is in shade. You either have to estimate the area off of the  
sunpath diagrams (which isn't correct as hour lines converge at high  
solar altitudes on the image) or resort to a different method which  
requires twelve reports (one per month) to be created for every point  
which takes a lot more time than it should.  We have fed this back  
repeatedly to SquareOne for years, then found out Autodesk now license  
it.  I am pretty sure our guys have fed this back to Autodesk as well  
with no joy. For those that have had similar experiences I would  
really encourage you to check this and provide the feedback to the  
developers.  It should be easily fixed but has persisted for years and  
puts a bit of tarnish on an otherwise great piece of software.

Graham Carter

Here's a link for finding ambient CO2 concentrations in response to an
inquiry posted yesterday. They are posted on the EPA website and based
on NOAA data. 

 

http://epa.gov/climatechange/science/recentac.html

 

The second link is for an EPA's emissions inventory which estimates how
much CO2 is emitted from different commercial and industrial activities.

I agree with Carol. If your exterior lights are evenly placed along the wall, you may use the entire length to calculate allowances. This is to show compliance. In your energy model, your base line should be the same as the proposed design, because it is a non-tradable surface and you can't claim savings. Also you can't claim benefit for other categories that don't comply with the code.

Thanks,

Weixiu

Yes, due to the fact that I didn?t want to claim unfair credit over the baseline I only considered a very small portion of the wall to be ?lit?.? This caused my baseline allowance to be lower than my proposed which set off a red flag for the LEED reviewer due to Exterior Lighting Power density being a mandatory provision of ASHRAE 90.1-2004.

I would divide the 500 Watts by the entire 100 lineal feet of the wall the fixture is on. I don't see what you would gain by just considering the lit area of the wall but I can see where you might be penalized. Since it's just an exterior load there aren't any interactive effects to worry about either.

Are you sure about your interpretation of the non-tradable surfaces. If I understand correctly what you are saying is that even though my proposed design uses less lighting power compared to the baseline for the non-tradable surfaces I cannot get an benefit from those savings.
?
?My understanding was that total of tradable and nontradable should be less than the overall allowance +5% additional unrestricted allowance. 
Each category of tradable does not have to comply prescriptively and can be higher than base allowance in some cases and have increased savings in another. For example my overall lighting energy use can be higher for say parking area compared to the base allowance as long as I compensate that additional power by increased savings in another category say plaza area.
On the contrary one has to meet the prescriptive requirements for each category of non tradable surfaces and cannot exceed the allowance. Increased building fa?ade lighting cannot be compensated by reduced gatehouse inspection station lighting.
?
Can someone please confirm this. 
In my model I have significant savings in non-tradable lighting and I have been modeling Ashrae allowance for non tradable area based on area being lit in base case and actually proposed design wattage and lighting power in the proposed case which is much lower. 
?

The problem I am having is that I do not understand how to correctly calculate the baseline power allowance.? Part of the mandatory provisions of section 9.4.5 states that you cannot exceed the baseline exterior lighting power allowance with your proposed building.? By incorrectly calculating the baseline exterior lighting and showing this in my model the LEED reviewer has flagged my EAp2 credit for denial due to not complying with the mandatory provisions.

There is a "Heat Pump Pool Heater" reference (in chapter 7 of 90.1-2004 at
least) which I assume is an air-water configuration.  You'd have to check
the test procedure to be certain (ASHRAE 146) though.  Other than that, I
don't think ASHRAE has addressed this equipment (or water-water HP's for
that matter) yet, gggrrrrrr.

Hi,
Does Ashrae Std 90.1-2007 impose any minimum performance criteria for
air-to-water heat pumps working as central hot water generators for
heating purposes?
In tables 6.8.1 I can only find minimum performance requirements for
air-to-air, water source, groundwater source and ground source heat
pumps, but nothing about air-to-water.

I am not a LEED reviewer but I agree with Arvinder's approach below. Model the actual exterior lighting design for the proposed model and use the maximum allowable exterior lighting for the baseline for each surface that is modeled for the proposed design. From the ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004 and 2007 User's Manuals, p G-18:
 
"Other than cases where the lighting is exempted, credit may be taken for improvements in exterior lighting efficacy or wattage. If the proposed building does not have an exterior lighting application (for instance a parking lot that is not lighted), the baseline building shall not have the exterior lighting application either. If the lighting application exists, however, then the proposed building can take credit for a more efficient system."
 
To answer Robby's question, I agree with Carol Gardner that for an "illuminated wall" you should use the entire length of the wall to calculate the lighting power allowance for compliance with 9.4.5, even if you only have a single fixture in the center.

The intent of the standard seems to not allow lower non-tradable lighting
power in the proposed model compared to the baseline, because this would in
effect make it subject to trade off. Below is an abstract from 90.1 user
manual with the relevant text highlighted in red.  

 

Exterior Building Lighting

Power (? 9.4.5)

The Standard specifies power limits for

many exterior lighting applications

including parking lots, walkways and

plazas, building entrances and exits,

canopies and overhangs and outdoor sales

areas. For these applications, an exterior

lighting power allowance is calculated for

the entire project and a lighting budget is

established.

Additional power allowances are

provided for other lighting applications

such as building facades, automatic teller

machines, guard stations, drive through

windows and parking near retail

establishments, but these are use-it-or lose-

it allowances and no tradeoffs are

permitted. There is a 5% adder that may

be applied to the exterior lighting power

allowance.

agrees with how you show compliance for non-tradable surfaces.

Are you sure about your interpretation of the non-tradable surfaces. If I
understand correctly what you are saying is that even though my proposed
design uses less lighting power compared to the baseline for the
non-tradable surfaces I cannot get an benefit from those savings.

 

 My understanding was that total of tradable and nontradable should be less
than the overall allowance +5% additional unrestricted allowance. 

Each category of tradable does not have to comply prescriptively and can be
higher than base allowance in some cases and have increased savings in
another. For example my overall lighting energy use can be higher for say
parking area compared to the base allowance as long as I compensate that
additional power by increased savings in another category say plaza area.

On the contrary one has to meet the prescriptive requirements for each
category of non tradable surfaces and cannot exceed the allowance. Increased
building fa?ade lighting cannot be compensated by reduced gatehouse
inspection station lighting.

 

Can someone please confirm this. 

In my model I have significant savings in non-tradable lighting and I have
been modeling Ashrae allowance for non tradable area based on area being lit
in base case and actually proposed design wattage and lighting power in the
proposed case which is much lower. 

 

Thanks

Weixiu,

 

The problem I am having is that I do not understand how to correctly
calculate the baseline power allowance.  Part of the mandatory provisions of
section 9.4.5 states that you cannot exceed the baseline exterior lighting
power allowance with your proposed building.  By incorrectly calculating the
baseline exterior lighting and showing this in my model the LEED reviewer
has flagged my EAp2 credit for denial due to not complying with the
mandatory provisions.

 

In short, I need to reply back with a corrected baseline lighting power
allowance, which I am having trouble with due to the unclear definition of
?illuminated wall?.

Robby,

 

My understanding is: since this is a non-tradable surface, base line and
proposed design should be the same even though it is well below allowances.

 

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Exterior Lighting Power Calculation for Building Facades

Can anyone with experience showing compliance with ASHRAE 90.1-2004 section
9.4.5 enlighten me as how the baseline calculation should be done? 

 

The confusion I?m having is with the definition of an illuminated wall or
surface length when applying the 5.0 W/linear foot allowance for building
fa?ades.  How is the lineal footage of an illuminated wall determined?  

 

For example, if a 100? wide wall has one exterior lighting fixture on it at
the center, is the entire wall considered to be illuminated and thus the
baseline lighting power allowance is 500W?  Or is there some method of
determining the actual portion of the wall that is illuminated?

 

This came up on a LEED project where I had applied table 9.4.5 as
conservatively as possible and only considered a portion of the wall to be
illuminated at each fixture.  

 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

If you go by ASHRAE?s definitions, a non-tradable surface 

 

(LPD calculations for the following applications can be used only for the specific application and cannot be traded between surfaces or with other exterior lighting. The following allowances are in addition to any allowance otherwise permitted in the ?Tradable Surfaces? section of this table.)

 

If I am interpreting this correctly, this means that for a building to comply, you have to comply for each tradable surface considered. So for example if you have two illuminated facades 100 feet long, and you had 2W/lft on one of them and 5.5w/lft on the other, you would be in violation of this because they are not tradable (even though the overall average is below 5w/lft).

I see nothing in appendix G about non-tradable surfaces.

I want to show them that for a 2 or 3 storied building with ton of

I have examined the effect of many parameters on the thermal performance of 6 typical houses (single storey and double storey houses) for a moderate climate of Sydney. a part of my report comes in the following for your consideration.
?
"Adding an overhang above all windows improved annual thermal performance of the typical houses in conditioned mode. However, this was not the case for the houses in free running mode. The houses presented different patterns of annual thermal performance in the different modes, responding to increments in overhang width.
Increases in overhang width of 1m resulted in an average of 4.8% enhancement in the house?s annual thermal performance in conditioned mode. The same overhang generally caused 3.7% deterioration in annual free running performance, while a slight improvement was observed in thermal performance in some cases.? The reason for these different results is made clear when comparing the seasonal performances of each house in two different house modes.
When all the overhang widths were increased to 1m, the summer performance improved by an average of 26.6% in conditioned mode. The improvement decreased to an average of 8% for all houses in free running mode. The winter performance of the typical houses in this situation deteriorated by an average of 8.2% in conditioned mode and 11.7% in the free running mode. Thus the deterioration that was observed in the annual free running performance of some of the houses in response to the setting of overhang with a width of 1m for all windows would appear to owe more to deterioration in their winter performance and less improvement in their summer performance in free running mode than in conditioned mode."

Fareed,

it will strongly depend on the glass-quality (and the thermal quality of the
walls) and the orientation, as well as on the climate. In fact even on the
efficiency of the production of electricity for light, and the way the
cooling and heating is done.
In fact you should take all of them into account when doing your
optimisation study. Using ESP-r, coupled with GenOpt, I once had the sizes
of the windows determined as a function of the consumed energy for lighting,
cooling and heating. You could add overhangs and optimize their width as
well. And of course, the code does not have to be ESP-r ....

Fareed

I have examined the effect of many parameters on the thermal performance of 6 typical houses (single storey and double storey houses) for a moderate climate of Sydney. a part of my report comes in the following for your consideration.
?
"Adding an overhang above all windows improved annual thermal performance of the typical houses in conditioned mode. However, this was not the case for the houses in free running mode. The houses presented different patterns of annual thermal performance in the different modes, responding to increments in overhang width.
Increases in overhang width of 1m resulted in an average of 4.8% enhancement in the house?s annual thermal performance in conditioned mode. The same overhang generally caused 3.7% deterioration in annual free running performance, while a slight improvement was observed in thermal performance in some cases.? The reason for these different results is made clear when comparing the seasonal performances of each house in two different house modes. 
When all the overhang widths were increased to 1m, the summer performance improved by an average of 26.6% in conditioned mode. The improvement decreased to an average of 8% for all houses in free running mode. The winter performance of the typical houses in this situation deteriorated by an average of 8.2% in conditioned mode and 11.7% in the free running mode. Thus the deterioration that was observed in the annual free running performance of some of the houses in response to the setting of overhang with a width of 1m for all windows would appear to owe more to deterioration in their winter performance and less improvement in their summer performance in free running mode than in conditioned mode."

Hi All,
          In one of project i was having saving of 26% from base case in my
proposed case .My proposed case chiller was air cooled screw with 3.1 COP
when i changed COP from 3.1 to IPLV of 4.5 i am getting saving of 38% i
wonder whether the results are correct or not, beacuse just by improvement
from 3.1 to 4.5 can really led to savings increment from 26 to 38%.

Please if any one can give me suggestions in this

Thanks

Hi, 

I am having an issue with simulating in eQUEST. When I go to simulate my
model (high school building) in eQUEST I get the following error appear:


Error : -1 standard file writing errors encountered

It's weird because it says I don't have any building errors but only
this writing error and it terminates without running the simulation
because of it. 
Because of there not being any building errors it fails to give me any
more information on this particular error. 
The only change I have made to this model to generate this error is that
I have installed an enthalpy economizer on some of the systems...I don't
understand how this could be related though. 

Has anyone come across this issue before? 

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.

Varkie,
 
I have used eQUEST for the GSHP and found that it oversizes the CW loop where it is working with a very low delta T (2F) and hence had a high pump energy component.  I tried to solve this by undersizing the loop to get a higher deltaT and at that point got almost 1/4th the pump energy.  I dont know if others have faced this, it would be great to hear about other solutions to this.

Message-ID: <078AC5207CEDE145A8C7C74FFB3975A07B0F7C@DALEXC1.shwgroup.com>

There is a debate going on in my office currently, regarding existing
buildings and their envelopes and what is required for EA Prerequisite
2.

 

The LEED 2009-NC Guide says:

 

 "To achieve points using this credit, the proposed design must meet the
following criteria:  

 

-Comply with the mandatory provisions (Sections 5.4, 6.4, 7.4, 8.4, 9.4
and 10.4) in Standard 90.1-2007 (with errata but without addenda).

-Inclusion of all the energy costs within and associated with the
building project.

-Compare against a baseline building that complies with Appendix G......
(we all know about that part).

 

What's got the debate going is that part about Complying with the
mandatory provisions (particularly Section 5.4).  Now, we do a lot of
existing buildings, wherein no insulation is added.  I know that, when
creating the energy model, that when modeling existing buildings, or
portions of existing buildings, where no alterations are being made,
that both the Proposed and Baseline building are modeled with the
as-existing construction.  However, it was brought up that, as the LEED
Guide specifically calls out Section 5.4 (which I've been unable to find
any mention of existing buildings), was intentional, to for any would-be
LEED projects to bring their existing envelope constructions up to
Section 5.4 requirements.  I've looked over the CIRs and didn't find
anything really telling.

 

Does anyone have any insights or suggestions?


Thanks!

Varkie,

 

Relative to the PV panels, you should be able to get this information from the manufacturer.

 

For example ? this is from a Kyocera cut sheet:

 

 

 

 

The eQUEST help file gives you some guidance for the input values when you right click and go to item help:

 

 

 

I have used this and compared it to RETscreen outputs and found them to be in the same ballpark.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] GSHP and PV using eQUEST

Are there any sample input files that show how to use the PV input forms, explain what the input fields mean, and how the results are calculated?  Has the eQUEST PV analysis and results been checked with other PV programs?

 

Attached are results for a building that has PV and GSHP.   The .inp and .pd2 files are in the zipped folder.  The building model is a simplified layout of the CCGT building that was awarded LEED Platinum. The questions are in italics (PV in red and GSHP in blue).  The options to look at are 4 and 4a (PV Surface and Shade Mount) and 5 and 5b (GSHP 200'-8x4 and 100'-2x2). 

 

ECO-3 shows the electric energy for lights, equipment, cooling and fans. 

 

ECO-4 added PV panels tilted at 30 degrees on the south window shades and on the roof.  How did the program determine the reduction in electric energy?

ECO-4a attached the PV panels of the same area to fixed shade.  Why did the electric energy use go up?

 

ECO-5 added GSHP ? 200? deep and 8 x 4 configuration.  The lights, equipment and cooling load electric use goes down.  The electric use for pumps and fans go up and so also does the natural gas use for heating.  What is the explanation?

ECO-5a changed the GSHP to 100? deep and 2 x 2 configuration.  Why does this smaller system save more energy?

 

What are the different types of PV systems? For this study I entered MC-SI.  What do the terms below mean and what should be their typical or default values (my dumb guesses are shown in parenthesis)?

 

VOLTS-OPEN-CKT (= 110)

VOLTS/T-OPEN-CKT (= -0.004)

AMPS-SHORT-CKT (= 10)

AMPS/T-SHORT-CKT (= -0.001)

VOLTS-MAX-PWR (= 75)

AMPS-MAX-PWR (= 5)

MIN-TRACK-VOLTS (= 0)

MAX-TRACK-VOLTS (=110)

 

The original analysis was with DOE2.1E which does not have PV analysis.  The study assumed that the light energy corresponds to the solar energy and about 10% of the direct solar energy was assumed to be converted to 110V electricity.

 

I have sent this message before and received no response.  Has anyone used the eQUEST program?s GSHP and PV analysis for energy code compliance and LEED certification?

Martin,
 
I'll argue that you should not need to upgrade the envelope of an
existing building to meet Section 5.4 except where you are creating new
envelope surfaces (such as new building additions). Likewise, you should
not need to improve the efficiency of existing equipment per Section
6.4, as long as you are not replacing it with new. The scope of Standard
90.1-2007 (and -2004) includes:
1.)     new buildings and their systems
2.)     new portions of buildings and their systems
3.)     new systems and equipment in existing buildings
 
My standard disclaimer that I am not a LEED reviewer applies.

Thanks, Bill.

 

That's pretty much been my interpretation, as well.  However, it was
suggested by some in the office that LEED specifically called for THAT
section (5.4) to be met to ensure that the whole envelope was brought up
to Section 5.4 requirements......and that got me second-guessing my
interpretation.

 

At any rate, I appreciate the input.

I agree with Bill. I, too, am not a LEED reviewer but I have been an energy
code reviewer and the interpretation was always that the code requirements
for insulation were for new buildings and existing building where the wall
was going to be modified. That makes sense where requiring an existing
building to have all walls modified would not. LEED supports the reuse of
existing materials as well as energy efficiency so forcing a change would
seem counter
intuitive.

Seems to me, that these components if they are touched do need to be upgraded (note there are some exceptions to this (see 5.1.3)) barring those,

Two thoughts come to mind:
4.1.1.5 Changes in Space Conditioning. Whenever
unconditioned or semiheated spaces in a building are converted
to conditioned spaces, such conditioned spaces shall
be brought into compliance with all the applicable requirements
of this standard that would apply to the building envelope,
heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, service water
heating, power, lighting, and other systems and equipment of
the space as if the building were new.
So that's pretty clear, but limited in scope to particular projects,

more generally:
4.1.1.4 Replacement of Portions of Existing Buildings.
Portions of a building envelope, heating, ventilating, airconditioning,
service water heating, power, lighting, and other
systems and equipment that are being replaced shall be considered
as alterations of existing

following this to the definition and then to the scope of alterations leads one to section 4.2.1.3
4.2.1.3 Alterations of Existing Buildings. Alterations
of existing buildings shall comply with the provisions of Sections
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, provided, however, that nothing in
this standard shall require compliance with any provision of
this standard if such compliance will result in the increase of
energy consumption of the building.
Exceptions:
a. A building that has been specifically designated as
historically significant by the adopting authority or is
listed in The National Register of Historic Places or
has been determined to be eligible for listing by the
US Secretary of the Interior need not comply with
these requirements.
b. Where one or more components of an existing building
or portions thereof are being replaced, the annual
energy consumption of the comprehensive design
shall not be greater than the annual energy consumption
of a substantially identical design, using the same
energy types, in which the applicable requirements of
Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, as provided in Section
4.2.1.3, and such compliance is verified by a design
professional, by the use of any calculation methods
acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction.

Thanks, Bill.

That's pretty much been my interpretation, as well.  However, it was suggested by some in the office that LEED specifically called for THAT section (5.4) to be met to ensure that the whole envelope was brought up to Section 5.4 requirements......and that got me second-guessing my interpretation.

At any rate, I appreciate the input.

Martin,

I'll argue that you should not need to upgrade the envelope of an existing building to meet Section 5.4 except where you are creating new envelope surfaces (such as new building additions). Likewise, you should not need to improve the efficiency of existing equipment per Section 6.4, as long as you are not replacing it with new. The scope of Standard 90.1-2007 (and -2004) includes:
1.)   new buildings and their systems
2.)   new portions of buildings and their systems
3.)   new systems and equipment in existing buildings

My standard disclaimer that I am not a LEED reviewer applies.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED EA P2 requirement clarification

There is a debate going on in my office currently, regarding existing buildings and their envelopes and what is required for EA Prerequisite 2.

The LEED 2009-NC Guide says:

 "To achieve points using this credit, the proposed design must meet the following criteria:

-Comply with the mandatory provisions (Sections 5.4, 6.4, 7.4, 8.4, 9.4 and 10.4) in Standard 90.1-2007 (with errata but without addenda).
-Inclusion of all the energy costs within and associated with the building project.
-Compare against a baseline building that complies with Appendix G......  (we all know about that part).

What's got the debate going is that part about Complying with the mandatory provisions (particularly Section 5.4).  Now, we do a lot of existing buildings, wherein no insulation is added.  I know that, when creating the energy model, that when modeling existing buildings, or portions of existing buildings, where no alterations are being made, that both the Proposed and Baseline building are modeled with the as-existing construction.  However, it was brought up that, as the LEED Guide specifically calls out Section 5.4 (which I've been unable to find any mention of existing buildings), was intentional, to for any would-be LEED projects to bring their existing envelope constructions up to Section 5.4 requirements.  I've looked over the CIRs and didn't find anything really telling.

Does anyone have any insights or suggestions?

Thanks!

These guys have a good bit of interesting reading ? recommend bookmarking this link if you also have the capacity to be entertained/chuckling with this kind of thing =).  As I read this call for reason/logic, I recalled this article they put out (linked above) that pretty well spells out the logic to a layman behind ?less glass > better glass.?

 

That article above is probably worth your time and your architects? to read over to get the point across.  If/when they want you to drive it home, I?d suggest simply building your site-specific 2/3 story building model and running it once with something like 30% glazing (with a picture so they can visually see that?s a lot of glass), and again with 100% storefront glass box and let their eyes bug at the energy cost differences.

 

Impact of overhangs for a ?typical building? is something you?ll have trouble finding an answer to, as it?s obviously quite site and orientation specific.  Again I?d suggest running two models and observing the differences with/without the overhangs in question.   eQuest is one of many tools appropriate to the task-at-hand.

I have examined the effect of many parameters on the thermal performance of 6 typical houses (single storey and double storey houses) for a moderate climate of Sydney. a part of my report comes in the following for your consideration.

 

"Adding an overhang above all windows improved annual thermal performance of the typical houses in conditioned mode. However, this was not the case for the houses in free running mode. The houses presented different patterns of annual thermal performance in the different modes, responding to increments in overhang width.

Increases in overhang width of 1m resulted in an average of 4.8% enhancement in the house?s annual thermal performance in conditioned mode. The same overhang generally caused 3.7% deterioration in annual free running performance, while a slight improvement was observed in thermal performance in some cases.  The reason for these different results is made clear when comparing the seasonal performances of each house in two different house modes. 

When all the overhang widths were increased to 1m, the summer performance improved by an average of 26.6% in conditioned mode. The improvement decreased to an average of 8% for all houses in free running mode. The winter performance of the typical houses in this situation deteriorated by an average of 8.2% in conditioned mode and 11.7% in the free running mode. Thus the deterioration that was observed in the annual free running performance of some of the houses in response to the setting of overhang with a width of 1m for all windows would appear to owe more to deterioration in their winter performance and less improvement in their summer performance in free running mode than in conditioned mode." 

  

 

Hope this help

	Folks,

	 

Does anyone have good research data using simulations on the impact of overhangs and shadings for a typical building? 

  

I am having hard time convincing architects to reduce the glazing. They will make it a glass building if they are given a chance. 

  

I want to show them that for a 2 or 3 storied building with ton of glazing and few feet of overhang will not help the cooling/heating loads at all. 

  

I would appreciate your input. 

  

Thanks much.

Dear all,

A colleague of mine is looking for the following information, I felt some of
the subscribers of this mailing list might be able to help:

I am looking for information on the market penetration of energy management
system or building automation/management systems in commercial new
construction. Ideally, these numbers would be presented broken down by
building type (retail, offices, etc) and size (square footage) for
Califnornia, but similar information from other states will also be helpful.
I am particularly interested in these values as related to lighting control
systems. Any information or ideas on where to look would be appreciated.

Hi Scott!

 

I ran into similar head-scratchers as I learned the ins and outs of
where VE Ware fits in my kit of energy design/modeling tools.  My
ultimate conclusion is that VE Ware is a great tool for fast,
comparative studies of window/wall ratios, building massing studies,
basic envelope construction comparisons and overhang studies.  If and
when it comes to analyzing mechanical systems, VE Ware is not your tool
of choice for the reasons you're bringing up.  There's simply too many
variables not being accounted for, and it's not a very transparent tool
regarding what the various system options are actually modeling.  

 

If you own an IES suite of packages (beyond the free sketchup tool), I
believe you have the potential to transition your sketchup design work
into a more sophisticated (complex) energy model that can better account
for the myriad of variables you'll want to define when exploring
different HVAC system options.  I cannot vouch for this path as my firm
as of yet does not have the IES for-cost packages.

 

Personally, I find the IES VE sketchup plugin to be a great tool for the
above stated purposes.  I work with my architects to define a
"conceptual HVAC design" phase immediately following the building
massing/envelope/glazing/overhang decisions, wherin I take the sketchup
model as a reference and build an eQuest model that allows me to build
up the actual systems we're trying to compare to a degree I feel is
sufficiently accurate.

 

If I may, a single cautionary note - please tread carefully and
recognize that "carbon footprint" does NOT (often) necessarily correlate
to "energy efficiency" or "low utility bills."  All building designers
(architects + engineers) motivated for "green" design need to be very
self-aware of what their actual goals are, as these can cause some real
conflicts =).

 

I realize I'm dancing around your specific results without a specific
answer, and that's because I am not an expert on what's going on "behind
the scene" with the VEware plugin.  I'd strongly encourage you to pose
your exact situation at the IES support forums and/or the Virtual-Sim
mailing list here at onebuilding.org for specific advice regarding which
systems you should be choosing to get the intended comparisons!  I'd
venture a guess that you are incorrectly assuming "waterloop heat pump"
means "geothermal heat pump."  Both are loaded system descriptions that
could mean a lot of different things - again I would suggest selecting
another tool (perhaps including your project's energy/MEP consultant?)
to do the comparative mechanical system analyses you desire ;).

 

Best of luck!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] IES VE Ware

 

Dear listers,

I was doing a simulation using VE Ware plug-in for sketchup carbon
footprint tool, and I am not a technically savvy user, just a dumb
architectural designer...so I had a question.

 

All variables were the same between two scenarios, except for the HVAC
type.  Under one scenario I was simulating a split mechanical system
with mechanical cooling, and under the other I was simulating a
waterloop heat pump (which I assume is the same as geothermal heat
pump?), and the fuel source was electric.

 

The carbon footprint for the waterloop heat pump was greater than the
split system with mechanical cooling.  I would've thought it would be
the reverse.

 

Can someone explain this to me?  Any other comments on the carbon
footprint tool for VE ware sketchup plugin?

 

Thanks so much for your time.

This article (or a version of it) appeared in the ASHRAE Journal a few months back and lit a firestorm of letters to the Editor.  I think the author is on target and also excellent at getting his readers to think in greater depth about some of the common design issues of our day.

These guys have a good bit of interesting reading ? recommend bookmarking this link if you also have the capacity to be entertained/chuckling with this kind of thing =).  As I read this call for reason/logic, I recalled this article they put out (linked above) that pretty well spells out the logic to a layman behind ?less glass > better glass.?

 

That article above is probably worth your time and your architects? to read over to get the point across.  If/when they want you to drive it home, I?d suggest simply building your site-specific 2/3 story building model and running it once with something like 30% glazing (with a picture so they can visually see that?s a lot of glass), and again with 100% storefront glass box and let their eyes bug at the energy cost differences.

 

Impact of overhangs for a ?typical building? is something you?ll have trouble finding an answer to, as it?s obviously quite site and orientation specific.  Again I?d suggest running two models and observing the differences with/without the overhangs in question.   eQuest is one of many tools appropriate to the task-at-hand.

Free running: refers to the state of a building that is naturally ventilated and does not use any mechanical equipment to maintain or improve its indoor thermal condition.

Fareed

 

I have examined the effect of many parameters on the thermal performance of 6 typical houses (single storey and double storey houses) for a moderate climate of Sydney. a part of my report comes in the following for your consideration.

 

"Adding an overhang above all windows improved annual thermal performance of the typical houses in conditioned mode. However, this was not the case for the houses in free running mode. The houses presented different patterns of annual thermal performance in the different modes, responding to increments in overhang width.

Increases in overhang width of 1m resulted in an average of 4.8% enhancement in the house?s annual thermal performance in conditioned mode. The same overhang generally caused 3.7% deterioration in annual free running performance, while a slight improvement was observed in thermal performance in some cases.  The reason for these different results is made clear when comparing the seasonal performances of each house in two different house modes. 

When all the overhang widths were increased to 1m, the summer performance improved by an average of 26.6% in conditioned mode. The improvement decreased to an average of 8% for all houses in free running mode. The winter performance of the typical houses in this situation deteriorated by an average of 8.2% in conditioned mode and 11.7% in the free running mode. Thus the deterioration that was observed in the annual free running performance of some of the houses in response to the setting of overhang with a width of 1m for all windows would appear to owe more to deterioration in their winter performance and less improvement in their summer performance in free running mode than in conditioned mode." 

  

 

Hope this help

 

Maria

Folks,

 

Does anyone have good research data using simulations on the impact of overhangs and shadings for a typical building? 

  

I am having hard time convincing architects to reduce the glazing. They will make it a glass building if they are given a chance. 

  

I want to show them that for a 2 or 3 storied building with ton of glazing and few feet of overhang will not help the cooling/heating loads at all. 

  

I would appreciate your input. 

  

Thanks much.

Morning all. I'm researching MSc programs in sustainable building design,
energy efficiency, power generation, etc in the US. I plan on continuing my
education through a PhD. I've been working as a mechanical engineer for the
last three years, (and fortunately still am). I've been lucky enough to
gather a broad range of experience on mechanical design, energy analysis,
and LEED documentation for various types of facilities from small post
offices to hospital complexes. I'm looking for a program that is well
established at a top university, and preferably offers funding.

I decided I need to go back to school because my leisure activities are
more academic than "fun." In my free time I've been writing a paper on the
practical (daily) application and workflow of energy analysis in industry,
reviewing my Numerical Methods text from undergrad, and learning OpenFOAM
and NIST FDS to try to simulate natural ventilation for a volunteer project
I'm involved with located in Sudan.

I've done my research on graduate programs and have a list of about 10
universities I'm interested in. The question I'm trying to answer right now
is "Did I miss any universities with programs that align with my interest?"
If anyone on this list could provide feedback on universities,
organization, funding sources, or personal experiences I would greatly
appreciate it.

Thanks in advance,
Shariq

Hi all,
I am trying to build a Baseline Energy model for a building using TRACE and
i have been having trouble with reducing the unmet heating load hours (below
300 to satisfy baseline performance). If any of you all have experience in
ways that it could be reduced, please suggest me some methods. Your help is

I have tried certain things like changing the Hstat schedule but it seems

If you haven't checked it already, CDS has a really good, informative video tutorial on their help website dealing with this very thing.  It's helped me in the past, almost as much as calling their tech support.

Subject: Demand numbers to report for LEED EAc1 template

Hi all -

Could someone tell me which numbers in the PS-E report to use for the Demand numbers that are reported in the LEED EAc1 template, Table 1.8.1 and 1.8.2?

I have a baseline model showing 842,583 kwh for lighting, a max kw of 215.2, and a peak enduse of 45.1. Then in my proposed model my lighting kwh decreases to 654,000, max kw goes down to 167.4, but peak enduse jumps up to 155.4. Also for my equipment, the kwh and max kw are the same for both base and proposed, whereas the peak enduse is higher in the proposed. Energy being the same and demand being higher seems weird. (See attached or below.)

If we use peak enduse, is it okay to report a value of zero demand for some of the categories?


Baseline results:

. and if you are an Architect and modeling is new to you, you may want to
take a look at COMFEN 3 from the famous LBNL   -
http://windows.lbl.gov/software/comfen/comfen.html  

  It's free and will allow you to test the 20% vs 30% vs 40% WWR debate for
your particular climate, including all sorts of shading, building
orientation, and glass types too.

 

There is another package called EFEN that does much the same for whole
buildings -  http://www.designbuildersoftware.com/efen.php

 

Try them - it will take you 2 hours to get your first model out and you will
probably find this approach better than the usual rules-of-thumb :-)

This article (or a version of it) appeared in the ASHRAE Journal a few
months back and lit a firestorm of letters to the Editor.  I think the
author is on target and also excellent at getting his readers to think in
greater depth about some of the common design issues of our day.

These guys have a good bit of interesting reading - recommend bookmarking
this link if you also have the capacity to be entertained/chuckling with
this kind of thing =).  As I read this call for reason/logic, I recalled
this article they put out (linked above) that pretty well spells out the
logic to a layman behind "less glass > better glass."

 

That article above is probably worth your time and your architects' to read
over to get the point across.  If/when they want you to drive it home, I'd
suggest simply building your site-specific 2/3 story building model and
running it once with something like 30% glazing (with a picture so they can
visually see that's a lot of glass), and again with 100% storefront glass
box and let their eyes bug at the energy cost differences.

 

Impact of overhangs for a "typical building" is something you'll have
trouble finding an answer to, as it's obviously quite site and orientation
specific.  Again I'd suggest running two models and observing the
differences with/without the overhangs in question.   eQuest is one of many
tools appropriate to the task-at-hand.

I have examined the effect of many parameters on the thermal performance of
6 typical houses (single storey and double storey houses) for a moderate
climate of Sydney. a part of my report comes in the following for your
consideration.

 

"Adding an overhang above all windows improved annual thermal performance of
the typical houses in conditioned mode. However, this was not the case for
the houses in free running mode. The houses presented different patterns of
annual thermal performance in the different modes, responding to increments
in overhang width.

Increases in overhang width of 1m resulted in an average of 4.8% enhancement
in the house's annual thermal performance in conditioned mode. The same
overhang generally caused 3.7% deterioration in annual free running
performance, while a slight improvement was observed in thermal performance
in some cases.  The reason for these different results is made clear when
comparing the seasonal performances of each house in two different house
modes. 

When all the overhang widths were increased to 1m, the summer performance
improved by an average of 26.6% in conditioned mode. The improvement
decreased to an average of 8% for all houses in free running mode. The
winter performance of the typical houses in this situation deteriorated by
an average of 8.2% in conditioned mode and 11.7% in the free running mode.
Thus the deterioration that was observed in the annual free running
performance of some of the houses in response to the setting of overhang
with a width of 1m for all windows would appear to owe more to deterioration
in their winter performance and less improvement in their summer performance
in free running mode than in conditioned mode." 

  

 

Hope this help

Folks,

 

Does anyone have good research data using simulations on the impact of
overhangs and shadings for a typical building? 

  

I am having hard time convincing architects to reduce the glazing. They will
make it a glass building if they are given a chance. 

  

I want to show them that for a 2 or 3 storied building with ton of glazing
and few feet of overhang will not help the cooling/heating loads at all. 

  

I would appreciate your input. 

  

Thanks much.

built environment are being employed to inform decisions in building design,
construction, operation, and maintenance. The objectives are improved energy
efficiency, minimum life cycle cost, quality life support, and optimized
environmental performance. The submitted papers should deal with different
simulation and optimization tools and techniques for (1) building physics;
(2) air conditioning and heating systems; (3) energy supply systems, (4) air
movement in buildings; (5) indoor air quality, (6) building services
(lighting systems, cold and hot water supply); and (7) environmentally green
buildings.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SPECIAL SESSION on Building Energy Simulations & Optimizations at AfricaMS
2010 intends to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss key
issues, approaches, open problems, innovative applications and trends in
this research area.

Papers should contain original contributions not published or submitted
elsewhere. Papers up to 10 pages (including figures, tables and references)
can be submitted. Papers should follow the
format, which is single spaced, two columns, 10 pt Times New Roman font. All
submissions should be electronic (in PDF) and will be peer-reviewed by at
least two program committee
members.

Full papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the proceedings.
Note that at least one author from each accepted paper should register to
attend AfricaMS 2010 to get the paper published in the proceedings. The
papers should be submitted at : bojic at kg.ac.rs

Subject: [Bldg-sim] BIM and Sustainability using ECOTECT and eQUEST Mar 11-12
Message-ID: <fabe8399d038.4b753afe@iit.edu>

Please check the website below for information on the Seminar on BIM and Sustainability to be held on the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) Chicago Campus, College of Architecture Computer Laboratory (3410 Bldg, Room 110) from Thursday March 11 to Friday March 12 (two days). 
http://www.iit.edu/arch/programs/graduate/phd/activities/building_energy_s6.shtml
All day Thursday and Friday morning, the presentation will be BIM and ECOTECT.  Participants will learn about; 1) File conversion; BIM and Building Simulation Program (ECOTECT, eQUEST, and GBS), 2) Various Simulations and Analysis using ECOTECT; Solar Analysis, Shadow & Shading, Sun-path Diagram, Solar Radiation and Lighting Analysis.  This is an opportunity to try out this program on computers before purchasing it. 
Friday afternoon presentation will be energy analysis using eQUEST.  Participants will receive a CD containing detailed information (step by step slides) on (1) using eQUEST, (2) case studies (DOE2.1E and eQUEST input files) and (3) several useful short programs.  The half-day presentation is an overview of the three topics.  The emphasis will be on practical design issues associated with real projects using the case studies.  This includes creating and saving user libraries (utility rates, etc.) in DOE2.2.  Participants are expected to be familiar with using eQUEST.
 
One of the programs that will be provided on the CD (not mentioned in the announcement website) is the APEC HCC-V Loads program.  It has a forms interface.  It is a quick and simple way of estimating building design loads for sizing equipment.  If necessary the seminar can be extended through Saturday March 13 morning.  
To register for the IIT Seminar 6 or to request additional information, please contact one of the following:
- Payam Bahrami, Ph.D Administrative Assistant, arch_phd at iit.edu or 312.567.3930

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Dead band
Message-ID: <BBD3B8CDB75B5248AC6C9D7D8F0121ED02568638E4@ffxmail-01.hq.setty.com>

How do you apply the following requirement in ASHRAE 90.1-2007 in relation to cooling and heating set-points and to throttling ranges:

" 6.4.3.1.2  Dead Band. Where used to control both heating and cooling, zone thermostatic controls shall be capable of providing a temperature range or dead band of at least 5?F within which the supply of heating and cooling energy to the zone is shut off or reduced to a minimum."

My understanding is that if you have, for instance, a heating set-point at 70?F and a cooling set-point at 76?F, the throttling range (as per the definition in eQuest) for both cooling and heating has to be at the maximum 1?F.

Can someone clarify?

I regularly use AGI32 for any daylighting studies, though I've not yet
been involved in a project where that credit was not handled by the
non-photometric options of documenting compliance.

 

Here's a quick writeup describing how you can use AGI32 to handle the
daylight factor grids for LEED 2.1 and 2009:

I ran into limitations with the USGBC's other compliance demonstration
methods all the time at my last job; the so-called glazing factor
spreadsheet can only deal with very basic space types. I always used
Radiance for my simulation-based documentation, because it's what I'm
familiar with. But folks here have mentioned the other popular ones. Any
lighting simulation software that includes a daylight simulation component
will likely work, as long as you can set up grids and define standard CIE
clear and overcast sky types (depending on which compliance path you're
using). Lumen Designer is no longer commercially available, but as
mentioned, AGI32, Radiance, and also 3DStudio Max Design can all be used
for these types of simulations when the spreadsheet the USGBC provides
falls short. DiaLux is a freely available (Windows) program that
incorporates daylighting calculations as well:

Nick,

 

Thanks for the heads up, this looks like something worth looking into.
How was the learning curve with the program? And are high quality
renderings fairly simple to produce if you have a dxf file? They have
some nice photo-quality renderings on their website, but it'd be nice to
hear that it doesn't require gobs of time to produce.

 

Karen, we currently use Rayfront, and I think it takes some workarounds
to produce LEED documentation. I haven't personally used it, and I think
it has a pretty steep learning curve.  On the other hand, it does
produce some very nice renderings...If only reviewers appreciated pretty
pictures J

 

Eric

IES is perfect for daylight calculations and it's approved for the
Daylighting credit.

www.iesve.com
I am a former IES consultant and worked for them for a few years so have
carried out many such simulations along with LEED analysis and dynamic
simulations.

I'm currently working as a building analyst in Vancouver and use the
software for LEED analysis here too.

Building Analyst in Vancouver.

I have been using IES for many years and performing LEED analysis.

It is well established and very versatile.

Hi -

We have followed the step-by-step process 'Exporting From SketchUp' as
outlined in Section 4.1.1 (pg 32) of the 'DAYSIM 2.1 Tutorial' dated
April 27, 2006.  We are using Sketchup v. 7 and DAYSIM v. 3.0 (beta).

We created a simple one-room 20'x20'x10'h model w/ 1 window in SketchUp
(no layers).  We then attempted to export the model into a .rif file
using the su2rad_daysim_r03 plugin.

We have had trouble loading the .rif file into DAYSIM.  We get an error
message (see attachment or below).

Is there an update to the procedure specific to DAYSIM v.3  that we are
not aware of?

Hi Nader,

I'm not very familiar with Daysim (only used it once or twice) but I do remember from using Radiance that "spaces" (as in when you hit the spacebar key) are delimiters. In order to make sure that they're not misused underscores must be used (hence the program title "su2rad_daysim_r03", no spaces). I believe this applies to all materials (ext wall should be ext_wall) textures (rough concrete > rough_concrete) etc.

As all the output files for Radiance/Daysim are text based, you should be able to open them in notepad/wordpad and scroll through to ensure that your naming convention is correct.

Hope this helps.

Kind regards,
Alex Krickx

I would not characterize AGI32 as a "pretty rendering" generator - there
are more efficient and appropriate tools for that purpose.  I'm a critic
first, and don't like to speak glowingly of any program, but AGI32 is
best characterized as one of the more sophisticated photometric software
solutions among the other options, with a correspondingly difficult
learning curve... 

 

While I am proficient in AGI32 I do the bulk of my photometric work with
Visual, as it's what I'm fastest with.  

 

I do utilize AGI32 for photometrics/renderings/daylight work when I'm
(A) working photometrics from a Sketchup model - as I've worked out how
to move Sketchup into AGI32, (B) need to perform daylighting calcs or
studies, as Visual doesn't have this component, (C) special/complicated
applications, such as sports pool surface illuminance calcs, or (D)
required to use AGI32 for some extraneous reason.  My general aversion
is really only rooted in the (to me) unintuitive UI, which if were all I
ever used would be something I'm sure I could get used to.  Again I find
I get simpler work done much faster in Visual if only because it's what
I'm familiar with. 

 

Speaking specifically to daylighting with AGI32 - it could certainly be
easier, but AGI32 produces something I've struggled to achieve with
other packages: accuracy.  I can model my office building from my desk,
calculate the solar contributions at the current instant at a specific
point, then walk over and measure the exact same reading.  It helps that
I happen to know our actual glazing properties and have a local
calibration factor to apply to standard IES sky models.   

 

Let me offer a caution to you and anyone else seeking to get started
with daylighting studies, however:  There will be a learning curve with
any new software, yes, but do not make the mistake of assuming that if
you can operate a software package that you will not need to progress
along an independent learning curve for knowledge in daylighting!  After
generating your first believable rendering, it's easy to fall into
thinking you must know what you're doing.  Read the IES Handbook to
understand where their standard sky models come from.  Read up on the
CIE models as well.  Test yourself and measure your results with
existing spaces.  There is a lot to learn regarding the properties of
glazing that you probably weren't required to learn for energy
modeling/photometric software.  Daylight modeling is a specific skillset
that requires knowledge unique from the average photometric or
energy-modeling pro.  Just be careful to not treat it as simply learning
to generate numbers/pictures from another piece of software.

 

Speaking to another question you brought up:  AGI32 does import
Autodesk's dwg/dxf.  Turning those into into a high quality (and
accurate) daylight rendering however does not happen at the push of a
button.

 

PS: If you're just looking to do fast, simply sun angle studies without
interreflections/soft shadows, and the ability to generate a pretty
rendering, I think you'd find the (free) Google Sketchup to be right up
your alley.  The pro version offers Autodesk proprietary format support
among a myriad of other formats.

 

Phew!  I'm off for the weekend =).  Happy Valentine's everybody!

Nick,

 

Thanks for the heads up, this looks like something worth looking into.
How was the learning curve with the program? And are high quality
renderings fairly simple to produce if you have a dxf file? They have
some nice photo-quality renderings on their website, but it'd be nice to
hear that it doesn't require gobs of time to produce.

 

Karen, we currently use Rayfront, and I think it takes some workarounds
to produce LEED documentation. I haven't personally used it, and I think
it has a pretty steep learning curve.  On the other hand, it does
produce some very nice renderings...If only reviewers appreciated pretty
pictures J

I regularly use AGI32 for any daylighting studies, though I've not yet
been involved in a project where that credit was not handled by the
non-photometric options of documenting compliance.

 

Here's a quick writeup describing how you can use AGI32 to handle the
daylight factor grids for LEED 2.1 and 2009:

Hi all.

I don't see anything attached to this messages so this is a bit speculation:

It is true that Daysim handles spaces in filenames poorly. You should
export to a path that does not contain spaces like "C:\temp\daysim\"
or the "projects" folder in the Daysim installation.

Sketchup also has problems with most characters that are not ASCII
(like accented characters). They should not be used in file paths,
material names, group names etc.

Finally there is a bug in su2rad_daysim_r03 which has appeared
recently, probably only triggered in an updated Sketchup version. If
that happens the export stops during the process and you only get a
*.rif file but no *.rad file which contains the geometry (and
is what you're really interested in). If that is the case please
contact me directly for a patch and further trouble shooting if
necessary.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi Karen,

I'm using DIALUX for daylight calculation.
Not too detailed and complicated but enough to comply with LEED Daylight Calculation requirements.

And its also FREE! Technical Support and Product Updates are also available.

I ran into limitations with the USGBC's other compliance demonstration
methods all the time at my last job; the so-called glazing factor
spreadsheet can only deal with very basic space types. I always used
Radiance for my simulation-based documentation, because it's what I'm
familiar with. But folks here have mentioned the other popular ones. Any
lighting simulation software that includes a daylight simulation
component will likely work, as long as you can set up grids and define
standard CIE clear and overcast sky types (depending on which compliance
path you're using). Lumen Designer is no longer commercially available,
but as mentioned, AGI32, Radiance, and also 3DStudio Max Design can all
be used for these types of simulations when the spreadsheet the USGBC
provides falls short. DiaLux is a freely available (Windows) program
that incorporates daylighting calculations as well:

SPECIAL SESSION
Increasingly, computer simulations and optimizations of energy flow inside
built environment are being employed to inform decisions in building design,
construction, operation, and maintenance. The objectives are improved energy
efficiency, minimum life cycle cost, quality life support, and optimized
environmental performance. The submitted papers should deal with different
simulation and optimization tools and techniques for (1) building physics;
(2) air conditioning and heating systems; (3) energy supply systems, (4) air
movement in buildings; (5) indoor air quality, (6) building services
(lighting systems, cold and hot water supply); and (7) environmentally green
buildings.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++
SPECIAL SESSION on Building Energy Simulations & Optimizations at AfricaMS
2010 intends to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss key
issues, approaches, open problems, innovative applications and trends in
this research area.

Papers should contain original contributions not published or submitted
elsewhere. Papers up to 10 pages (including figures, tables and references)
can be submitted. Papers should follow the
format, which is single spaced, two columns, 10 pt Times New Roman font. All
submissions should be electronic (in PDF) and will be peer-reviewed by at
least two program committee
members.

Full papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the proceedings.
Note that at least one author from each accepted paper should register to
attend AfricaMS 2010 to get the paper published in the proceedings. The
papers should be submitted at : bojic at kg.ac.rs  
or by using EasyChair at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ssbeso10

Subject: [Bldg-sim] G3.1.3.10 & G.3.1.3.11 ASHRAE
Message-ID: <586827531002150306x1cc89542h4ca282fc725ac6d6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
      In page  178 G.3.1.3.10 it is mentioned that chilled water pumps for
system 7 and 8 shall be modeled with baseline design power of 22W/gpm and in
G.3.1.3.11 it tells that for baseline consdenser water pump shall be modeled
with 19W/gpm .

I shall be obliged if anyone  can tell how to make these entries because
there is no direct input in software as W/gpm  for the primary , secondary
and condenser water pump.Is there any indirect approach .

I look forward for your valuable response.

Thanks
Sambhav Tiwari.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How to estimate performance of HVAC system in life cycle
	analysis?
Message-ID: <879150.51078.qm@web24007.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hello all,


In life cycle analysis of buildings, it seems it is very hard to estimate long-term performance of HVAC systems (or other building components), for example, air handling units, chiller, or boilers.   It makes sense that HVAC system will degrade with time, depending on many factors, like maintainence, wear-and-tear.  The problem is how to quantify these change with time. Maybe some probabilstic or scenario methods can be used. Would you please tell me the common method to predict these performance change or where I can find some good references about this topic?

Thanks,

Jim Terrry

Thomas:

Thank you for your reply.  I do not think the error is for spaces in
names.  After we export the file, Daysim cannot open the exported file
needing more files that never generated by Sketchup.

So my guess is that we are not doing the right steps in Skecthup export
to daysim.

Is there any more detailed instructions on how to export to daysim from
sketchup.. something like step-by-step for 1st timers?

Hi Tariq,

When you say "differed", what exactly do you mean? Dialux is radiosity based (like AGI32 and dear departed Lightscape), whereas Relux uses Radiance as the engine so it's essentially a raytracing-based simulation program. Different simulation algorithms, but both are valid approaches in general. In the general sense, especially in the context of documenting LEED certifications, I think both approaches have merit.

Dear All,

In the LEED NC 2009 Reference Manual, it is mentioned that receptacle
loads can be taken from a certain Table G-B? My copy of the 90.1 standard
does not have such a table, am I overlooking something here?

Also, what do receptacle loads include? Is this equivalent to process
loads? For example, are computers to be included in receptacle loads?

Thank you,

Omer Moltay, LEED AP

Amit,

I don't have the fundamentals here, but I recall a dinstinction is made for
recommended ventilation rates based on the type of room considered:
operating, recovery, ... Furthermore, I know specific requirements exist
depending on the risk of infection for or from the patient.

So, I think you cannot simply state it as such. Maybe contact the research
group of Jan Hensen (Technical University Eindhoven), I know they have
worked on conditioning of operating rooms.

Good luck,

Leen Peeters

Dear Amit,

 

Keep in mind that ASHRAE's "acceptable" level of CO2 has almost nothing to
do with health.  You could describe it as more of a "body odor" or
"pleasantness" index.  When the ambient levels of CO2 exceed their
recommendation (~1000 ppm), people start to feel that the indoor air is less
pleasant or "stuffy".

 

Health does not start to be affected until CO2 exceeds 5000 ppm. (per US EPA
and ACGIH)

When it comes to a 'healthcare' facility it is vital to understand what
happens in the facility as patient health can be affected in ways not taken
into consideration by EPA or ACGIH when calculating 'health' effects.  You
may want to have a charette with all the involved parties.  I suspect it is
often overlooked as everyone believes that the controls established for
operating theatres and so on addresses everything but go to a pulmonologist
and a cardiologist and ask them about average visitor/patient sensitivities
and concerns regarding things such as CO2 levels.  As an example, ask them
how CO2 levels impact folks with emphysema or an enlarged heart.  Those are
just two that come to mind and I am sure there are many others.

 

Seldom looked at but it should be all of the time with healthcare.  At the
least, I feel that good work requires you meet the occupant representatives
and ask about concerns AND let them know they do have some options.

 

My 2 cents.

 

Thanks,

Dear Amit,

 

Keep in mind that ASHRAE's "acceptable" level of CO2 has almost nothing to
do with health.  You could describe it as more of a "body odor" or
"pleasantness" index.  When the ambient levels of CO2 exceed their
recommendation (~1000 ppm), people start to feel that the indoor air is less
pleasant or "stuffy".

 

Health does not start to be affected until CO2 exceeds 5000 ppm. (per US EPA
and ACGIH)

Hello all,


In life cycle analysis of buildings, it seems it is very hard to estimate long-term performance of HVAC systems (or other building components), for example, air handling units, chiller, or boilers.?? It makes sense that HVAC system will degrade with time, depending on many factors, like maintainence, wear-and-tear.? The problem is how to quantify these change with time. Maybe some probabilstic or scenario methods can be used. Would you please tell me the common method to predict these performance change or where I can find some good references about this topic?

Thanks,

Due to urgency, we don't have the luxury of time to generate it and at the same time modeling the project.

Will it also be?possible for somebody to provide us a step by step procedure of generating BIN Weather File using Weather Processor?

Thanks in advance for assisting us on this matter.

Hello

Build sim

I need  help  to choose ACH for natural ventilated buildings and also the
infiltration value in ACH for same case.

Can we calibrate the temperature of a room model temperature of roof top
surface  to measured temperature of roof top surface .
Like surface temperature roof in simulation and measured conditions as we
are measuring temperature in deg. centigrade.

Like energy that can be calibrated using  IPMVP protocol with specified
value of  MBE % and CVRMSE %

or is there any protocol that is used in Natural ventilated buildings

thx in advance

Dear Shivraj,

 

Calibrating models, particularly naturally ventilated ones in any software
isn't easy.

 

What software are you using and what type of modelling are you doing?  What
are you looking to achieve?

 

If you've got the right measured data then you might even be able to model
the infiltration, but that will require you having weather data available.

 

Cheers

 

Paul

Hello

 Bldg sim community!!


We are trying to analyze/improve the thermal comfort in unconditioned
buildings through different
measures that are used as energy conservation measures in conditioned
buildings.
We have measured data for various surface temperatures and weather data.

*How can we calibrate this room model* as for experiment we have two room
which are identical to each.
One room roof top surface is painted  white(*to improve thermal Comfort
value PMV*) and other room surface is ordunary,

All:

 

Thanks to Mr. Dirkes.

 

Can anyone direct us to a study that says high CO2 in and of itself does
not cause health issues especially drowsiness?  We have asked for such a
study from those providing filtration prior to considering such
filtration on our projects.

 

I think CO2 is definitely related to energy use/modeling because you can
reduce levels of outside air if allowing higher CO2 levels.

 

Thanks:

 

Wes

Dear Amit,

 

Keep in mind that ASHRAE's "acceptable" level of CO2 has almost nothing
to do with health.  You could describe it as more of a "body odor" or
"pleasantness" index.  When the ambient levels of CO2 exceed their
recommendation (~1000 ppm), people start to feel that the indoor air is

Maybe I was doing something wrong in Dialux, but couldn't for love nor
money get them to match for the same simple setup. 

Both are free tools and I got much better agreement with Relux and
Radiance IES than with Dialux.

Hi Tariq,

When you say "differed", what exactly do you mean? Dialux is radiosity
based (like AGI32 and dear departed Lightscape), whereas Relux uses
Radiance as the engine so it's essentially a raytracing-based simulation
program. Different simulation algorithms, but both are valid approaches
in general. In the general sense, especially in the context of
documenting LEED certifications, I think both approaches have merit.

Dear Bldg-Sim community,

 

A few more comments for your consideration:

 

ASHRAE Standard 62.1 is the principal reference used for acceptable indoor
air quality.  It hasn't been mentioned in this discussion, so I want to make
sure you consult it.  It's Appendix A says, 

"CO2 is a bioeffluent generated by people at a rate determined by their
size, age, fitness, and activity level. At the same time people are
generating CO2, they are also producing odorous bioeffluents. These odorous
bioeffluents are generated proportionally to the rate of CO2 production,
although diet and personal hygiene also play a role. Nevertheless, CO2
concentration is a fairly dependable indicator of the concentration of the
odorous bioeffluents that the occupant component of the breathing zone
ventilation rate attempts to control. Hence, we can use CO2 concentration to
dynamically adjust the  occupant component of the ventilation rate to reduce
outdoor air intake rates when zones are not occupied at their design
occupancy."

 

The key concept misunderstood in most discussions about CO2 is that
maintaining a specific level of CO2 in an occupied space is done NOT because
the CO2 is unhealthful, but because it's a convenient indicator of occupant
comfort.  Comfort in this case is measured by "odorous bioeffluents",
otherwise known as "body odor".

 

While you can have harmful health effects from high levels of CO2, those
levels are (essentially) never encountered in a building.  The only "real"
situation I am aware of where CO2 concentrations exceed 2000ppm (which is
less than 50% of OSHA's TLV) is in a submarine; not too much fresh air
available there!

 

I've paid very close attention to information about CO2 over the last 20
years or so because for many of those years, I worked for a  manufacturer of
direct-fired heating equipment.  That type of heating is commonly used in
industrial occupancies due to its exceptional efficiency (92%) and a few
other factors.  One perceived downside of that equipment was that all of the
combustion products, including CO2, are released into the occupied space,
causing CO2 levels to rise, on occasion, to 2000ppm.

 

I also sat for several years on the ANSI Technical Advisory Group which
wrote the current national standards for that equipment.  The member group
of a couple dozen code officials, testing agency and manufacturing
representatives conducted an extensive review of literature and found no
evidence either in the literature or their collective experience that CO2
was a concern under 5000ppm.

 

In summary, my personal and fairly informed opinion is that the CO2 level in
buildings is not even close to a health issue.  Follow ASHRAE Standard 62.1
and all will be well.  A recent post on this list referenced an article at
buildingscience.com by Joe Lstiburek which (I think rightly) points out the
huge energy implications of introducing more air than indicated by Std 62.1;
that's a bigger issue, I think.

 

p.s., I could not find any literature in my archives regarding a correlation
between CO2 and drowsiness.  I don't think there's any literature indicating
a strong correlation, certainly not at normal building concentrations.

All:

 

Thanks to Mr. Dirkes.

 

Can anyone direct us to a study that says high CO2 in and of itself does not
cause health issues especially drowsiness?  We have asked for such a study
from those providing filtration prior to considering such filtration on our
projects.

 

I think CO2 is definitely related to energy use/modeling because you can
reduce levels of outside air if allowing higher CO2 levels.

Dear Amit,

 

Keep in mind that ASHRAE's "acceptable" level of CO2 has almost nothing to
do with health.  You could describe it as more of a "body odor" or
"pleasantness" index.  When the ambient levels of CO2 exceed their
recommendation (~1000 ppm), people start to feel that the indoor air is less
pleasant or "stuffy".

 

Health does not start to be affected until CO2 exceeds 5000 ppm. (per US EPA
and ACGIH)

Reniel,

You can obtain bin data from WDView 4.0, the ASHRAE weather data 
viewer (CD available from ASHRAE bookstore, $119 I think).

WDView 4.0 has data for a number of Saudi Arabia stations, including 
one called Al Ahsa, which might be the same place?

In any case, the CD has a great deal of useful design data for 5564 
locations worldwide.  It is worth having it at hand.

Nader,

I had experienced a few issues with the export feature, hence had got in touch with Thomas (who, for the record, is 
a great resource!) and am summarizing my findings:

1. su2rad_daysim_r03 has an export option 'daysim', which was not present in the earlier release. 
   Choose this when exporting.
2. After export, Daysim should start up on its own and load your model. You should be asked to load a 
   weather file, and assuming you define the sensors after export, a sensor points file will also be needed.
3. Exporting to a local drive folder (for e.g. C:\DAYSIM\Projects\XYZ) has worked best for me.
4. Materials from SketchUp do not get exported correctly to Daysim. Check you materials file after export to
   manually edit your values.
5. The export works with both SketchUp V6 and V7. I have been using Daysim 3.0 beta version, and have not 
   tried the export with the 2.1.P3 or P4 yet.

These are general findings, and I hope they help you some. This is a nice tool in that it allows you to export 
from the standard version of SketchUp, unlike the pro required otherwise.

Regards,
Umesh

Thomas:

Thank you for your reply.  I do not think the error is for spaces in names.  After we export the file, Daysim cannot open the exported file needing more files that never generated by Sketchup.

So my guess is that we are not doing the right steps in Skecthup export to daysim.

Is there any more detailed instructions on how to export to daysim from sketchup.. something like step-by-step for 1st timers?

Me again:

 

To me Mr. Dirkes' seems well informed on the issue of CO2 concentration.
Our concern has been the public's perception that one becomes sleepy, or
drowsy when exposed to PPM levels of CO2 in excess of 1000 PPM.  As they
say perception is reality and I can rarely come out on top of a
discussion involving a concerned parent with "my opinion".  Therefore
the need for a study or printed information to reinforce "my opinion".
We would considers a reference to the OSHA TLV, coupled with the 2000
PPM levels reached in a submarine.  Has the U.S. Navy printed anything?
Can I backup my opinion that high CO2 alone is a non-issue.  Mr. Dirkes'
comment was limited to CO2 and did not address all the other
contaminants that can build up in a space.  There are products purported
to eliminate these however they cannot eliminate CO2.  This requires
that CO2 be allowed to increase in concentration above 1000 PPM within
the space.  This, by the way, is easy (relatively cheap) to measure.  It
appears there is no direct evidence "other than OSHA's 5000 PPM TLV"
that up to 5000 PPM CO2 causes no harm.  True?

 

As a disclaimer I have not read ASHRAE Standard 62.1.

 

Thanks for your assistance:

Dear Bldg-Sim community,

 

A few more comments for your consideration:

 

ASHRAE Standard 62.1 is the principal reference used for acceptable
indoor air quality.  It hasn't been mentioned in this discussion, so I
want to make sure you consult it.  It's Appendix A says, 

"CO2 is a bioeffluent generated by people at a rate determined by their
size, age, fitness, and activity level. At the same time people are
generating CO2, they are also producing odorous bioeffluents. These
odorous bioeffluents are generated proportionally to the rate of CO2
production, although diet and personal hygiene also play a role.
Nevertheless, CO2 concentration is a fairly dependable indicator of the
concentration of the odorous bioeffluents that the occupant component of
the breathing zone ventilation rate attempts to control. Hence, we can
use CO2 concentration to dynamically adjust the  occupant component of
the ventilation rate to reduce outdoor air intake rates when zones are
not occupied at their design occupancy."

 

The key concept misunderstood in most discussions about CO2 is that
maintaining a specific level of CO2 in an occupied space is done NOT
because the CO2 is unhealthful, but because it's a convenient indicator
of occupant comfort.  Comfort in this case is measured by "odorous
bioeffluents", otherwise known as "body odor".

 

While you can have harmful health effects from high levels of CO2, those
levels are (essentially) never encountered in a building.  The only
"real" situation I am aware of where CO2 concentrations exceed 2000ppm
(which is less than 50% of OSHA's TLV) is in a submarine; not too much
fresh air available there!

 

I've paid very close attention to information about CO2 over the last 20
years or so because for many of those years, I worked for a
manufacturer of direct-fired heating equipment.  That type of heating is
commonly used in industrial occupancies due to its exceptional
efficiency (92%) and a few other factors.  One perceived downside of
that equipment was that all of the combustion products, including CO2,
are released into the occupied space, causing CO2 levels to rise, on
occasion, to 2000ppm.

 

I also sat for several years on the ANSI Technical Advisory Group which
wrote the current national standards for that equipment.  The member
group of a couple dozen code officials, testing agency and manufacturing
representatives conducted an extensive review of literature and found no
evidence either in the literature or their collective experience that
CO2 was a concern under 5000ppm.

 

In summary, my personal and fairly informed opinion is that the CO2
level in buildings is not even close to a health issue.  Follow ASHRAE
Standard 62.1 and all will be well.  A recent post on this list
referenced an article at buildingscience.com by Joe Lstiburek which (I
think rightly) points out the huge energy implications of introducing
more air than indicated by Std 62.1; that's a bigger issue, I think.

 

p.s., I could not find any literature in my archives regarding a
correlation between CO2 and drowsiness.  I don't think there's any
literature indicating a strong correlation, certainly not at normal
building concentrations.

Dear Wes,

 

I think you are asking "How do I tell a non-technical client / customer that
CO2 is not worth worrying about."

 

First, it's pretty hard to argue against popular opinion and the mainstream
media's  general inclination to promote gloom and doom.  After all, if ABC
or MSNBC or the local newspaper or (fill in the blank) says it, it MUST be
true.

 

My approach is something like:

.         Do my homework and become confident that I have a reasonable
understanding of the basis for whatever position I take.

.         Be open to the (normal) reality that not everything is known about
almost any topic.

.         Stand up for the truth and discourage worry or fear when it's not
warranted.

.         Present the best available information in a manner that helps
non-technical people understand it.  In the case of CO2 or any indoor
contaminant, it would be something like "The premier experts in the field of
indoor air quality have condensed the requirements for acceptable indoor air
quality into a single standard that is recognized throughout the world and
updated regularly.  That standard is called ASHRAE Standard 62.1.  At
Moseley Architects, we follow that Standard as well as other related
standards and are confident that it represents the most current and
comprehensive way to assure your health in an indoor environment.  Any
questions?"

 

That still may not carry the day for certain of your clients, but what the
heck!  Science is supposed to be a rational topic and you cannot argue an
irrational objection; don't try!

 

p.s., Since this is a building simulation forum, I should probably stop
here.  Feel free to call or e-mail directly at
jim at buildingperformanceteam.com.

that high CO2 alone is a non-issue.  Mr. Dirkes' comment was limited to CO2
and did not address all the other contaminants that can build up in a space.
There are products purported to eliminate these however they cannot
eliminate CO2.  This requires that CO2 be allowed to increase in
concentration above 1000 PPM within the space.  This, by the way, is easy
(relatively cheap) to measure.  It appears there is no direct evidence
"other than OSHA's 5000 PPM TLV" that up to 5000 PPM CO2 causes no harm.
True?

 

As a disclaimer I have not read ASHRAE Standard 62.1.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Acceptable CO2 levels

 

Dear Bldg-Sim community,

 

A few more comments for your consideration:

 

ASHRAE Standard 62.1 is the principal reference used for acceptable indoor
air quality.  It hasn't been mentioned in this discussion, so I want to make
sure you consult it.  It's Appendix A says, 

"CO2 is a bioeffluent generated by people at a rate determined by their
size, age, fitness, and activity level. At the same time people are
generating CO2, they are also producing odorous bioeffluents. These odorous
bioeffluents are generated proportionally to the rate of CO2 production,
although diet and personal hygiene also play a role. Nevertheless, CO2
concentration is a fairly dependable indicator of the concentration of the
odorous bioeffluents that the occupant component of the breathing zone
ventilation rate attempts to control. Hence, we can use CO2 concentration to
dynamically adjust the  occupant component of the ventilation rate to reduce
outdoor air intake rates when zones are not occupied at their design
occupancy."

 

The key concept misunderstood in most discussions about CO2 is that
maintaining a specific level of CO2 in an occupied space is done NOT because
the CO2 is unhealthful, but because it's a convenient indicator of occupant
comfort.  Comfort in this case is measured by "odorous bioeffluents",
otherwise known as "body odor".

 

While you can have harmful health effects from high levels of CO2, those
levels are (essentially) never encountered in a building.  The only "real"
situation I am aware of where CO2 concentrations exceed 2000ppm (which is
less than 50% of OSHA's TLV) is in a submarine; not too much fresh air
available there!

 

I've paid very close attention to information about CO2 over the last 20
years or so because for many of those years, I worked for a  manufacturer of
direct-fired heating equipment.  That type of heating is commonly used in
industrial occupancies due to its exceptional efficiency (92%) and a few
other factors.  One perceived downside of that equipment was that all of the
combustion products, including CO2, are released into the occupied space,
causing CO2 levels to rise, on occasion, to 2000ppm.

 

I also sat for several years on the ANSI Technical Advisory Group which
wrote the current national standards for that equipment.  The member group
of a couple dozen code officials, testing agency and manufacturing
representatives conducted an extensive review of literature and found no
evidence either in the literature or their collective experience that CO2
was a concern under 5000ppm.

 

In summary, my personal and fairly informed opinion is that the CO2 level in
buildings is not even close to a health issue.  Follow ASHRAE Standard 62.1
and all will be well.  A recent post on this list referenced an article at
buildingscience.com by Joe Lstiburek which (I think rightly) points out the
huge energy implications of introducing more air than indicated by Std 62.1;
that's a bigger issue, I think.

 

p.s., I could not find any literature in my archives regarding a correlation
between CO2 and drowsiness.  I don't think there's any literature indicating
a strong correlation, certainly not at normal building concentrations.

All:

 

Thanks to Mr. Dirkes.

 

Can anyone direct us to a study that says high CO2 in and of itself does not
cause health issues especially drowsiness?  We have asked for such a study
from those providing filtration prior to considering such filtration on our
projects.

 

I think CO2 is definitely related to energy use/modeling because you can
reduce levels of outside air if allowing higher CO2 levels.

 

Thanks:

Dear Amit,

 

Keep in mind that ASHRAE's "acceptable" level of CO2 has almost nothing to
do with health.  You could describe it as more of a "body odor" or
"pleasantness" index.  When the ambient levels of CO2 exceed their
recommendation (~1000 ppm), people start to feel that the indoor air is less
pleasant or "stuffy".

 

Health does not start to be affected until CO2 exceeds 5000 ppm. (per US EPA
and ACGIH)

Hi all,

This question is not directly related to the group but i wanted to  throw it

What is the acceptable CO2 level for a healthcare facility? Can i find the

Interesting. Of course both programs approach light transport simulation
differently and they each have different capabilities in that regard. It's
possible that one of your simulations either taxed one of the algorithms
to the brink, or that you didn't exercise the options enough.

Agreement with what? The implication here is that you had some real
world[TM] data that you were comparing to your simulations, which is very
interesting to me. Is this the case? Did you have some sort of benchmark
data that you were measuring against? If it was a case of comparing two
simulations, I'm afraid it will always be apples and oranges. But I'd be
interested in learning more about what your test was all about!

I thoroughly agree with Mr. Dirkes and have confronted the same situation Mr. Bonafe has described at contentious board meetings and public hearings over the years.  

I would just like to add a couple points to the conversation:

1. Under normal everyday levels and circumstances, CO2 is not a "contaminant" per se...as we all know, it is around us all the time and we breathe and exhale it constantly.....although, it doesn't help that the EPA has recently added to the confusion by classifying CO2 as a public/pollution hazard in order to try to regulate it from a climatological point of view.  Anyway, perhaps steering clear of using the word "contaminant" when discussing CO2 could help keep conversations with clients/the public productive.  

2. The other thing that does not seem to have been pointed out specifically, is that ASHRAE 62 recommendations are based on a differential level of CO2 with the outdoors.  It is the differential level between the indoor and outdoor levels of CO2 that is correlated with indoor air quality, not absolute levels of CO2 in the space.  Since most areas in the U.S. have an outdoor CO2 level of around 380 ppm, and a differential level of 400-500 ppm has been correlated with human perceptions of comfort for a given a given level of human activity and (in more recent editions of ASHRAE 62) the use of certain building materials, the recommended indoor levels are around 800 ppm.  So, the maximum levels of around 1000 ppm are  recommended not because CO2 is unhealthly above that level but because the greater differential with ambient levels of CO2 would correlate to lower amounts of outdoor air being brought into the building.  Studies have linked lower levels of
 outdoor air in a space to a reduction in human performance and perceptions of comfort.  So, perhaps focusing on the differential as the key to indoor air quality can reduce the fixation on a given level CO2 in a space.

In the case of CO2 or any indoor contaminant, it would be something like ?The premier experts in the field of indoor air quality have condensed the requirements for acceptable indoor air quality into a single standard that is recognized throughout the world and updated regularly.  That standard is called ASHRAE Standard 62.1.  At Moseley Architects, we follow that Standard as well as other related standards and are confident that it represents the most current and comprehensive way to assure your health in an indoor environment.  Any questions??
 
That still may not carry the day for certain of your clients, but what the heck!  Science is supposed to be a rational topic and you cannot argue an irrational objection; don?t try!

To me Mr. Dirkes? seems well informed on the issue of CO2 concentration.  Our concern has been the public?s perception that one becomes sleepy, or drowsy when exposed to PPM levels of CO2 in excess of 1000 PPM.  As they say perception is reality and I can rarely come out on top of a discussion involving a concerned parent with ?my opinion?.  Therefore the need for a study or printed information to reinforce ?my opinion?.  We would considers a reference to the OSHA TLV, coupled with the 2000 PPM levels reached in a submarine.

I need to jump in perhaps a little off topic. I have been doing field measurement and verification of DCV for the past year. I found very few systems installed correctly. The biggest issue is that our area (until this week) still has ASHRAE 62-1989 as code!! Designers were not specific ling the minimum and maximum outside air flow levels. Specs and balance reports need to be checked, talked to the balance contractor up front, do they even know what DCV is? (many I talked to did not!). Commissioning must be done on these systems!! (as it should be on 100% of the building but that's another issue).

Me again:

 

To me Mr. Dirkes' seems well informed on the issue of CO2 concentration.  Our concern has been the public's perception that one becomes sleepy, or drowsy when exposed to PPM levels of CO2 in excess of 1000 PPM.  As they say perception is reality and I can rarely come out on top of a discussion involving a concerned parent with "my opinion".  Therefore the need for a study or printed information to reinforce "my opinion".  We would considers a reference to the OSHA TLV, coupled with the 2000 PPM levels reached in a submarine.  Has the U.S. Navy printed anything?  Can I backup my opinion that high CO2 alone is a non-issue.  Mr. Dirkes' comment was limited to CO2 and did not address all the other contaminants that can build up in a space.  There are products purported to eliminate these however they cannot eliminate CO2.  This requires that CO2 be allowed to increase in concentration above 1000 PPM within the space.  This, by the way, is easy (relatively cheap) to measure.  It appears there is no direct evidence "other than OSHA's 5000 PPM TLV" that up to 5000 PPM CO2 causes no harm.  True?

 

As a disclaimer I have not read ASHRAE Standard 62.1.

 

Thanks for your assistance:

Dear Bldg-Sim community,

 

A few more comments for your consideration:

 

ASHRAE Standard 62.1 is the principal reference used for acceptable indoor air quality.  It hasn't been mentioned in this discussion, so I want to make sure you consult it.  It's Appendix A says, 

"CO2 is a bioeffluent generated by people at a rate determined by their size, age, fitness, and activity level. At the same time people are generating CO2, they are also producing odorous bioeffluents. These odorous bioeffluents are generated proportionally to the rate of CO2 production, although diet and personal hygiene also play a role. Nevertheless, CO2 concentration is a fairly dependable indicator of the concentration of the odorous bioeffluents that the occupant component of the breathing zone ventilation rate attempts to control. Hence, we can use CO2 concentration to dynamically adjust the  occupant component of the ventilation rate to reduce outdoor air intake rates when zones are not occupied at their design occupancy."

 

The key concept misunderstood in most discussions about CO2 is that maintaining a specific level of CO2 in an occupied space is done NOT because the CO2 is unhealthful, but because it's a convenient indicator of occupant comfort.  Comfort in this case is measured by "odorous bioeffluents", otherwise known as "body odor".

 

While you can have harmful health effects from high levels of CO2, those levels are (essentially) never encountered in a building.  The only "real" situation I am aware of where CO2 concentrations exceed 2000ppm (which is less than 50% of OSHA's TLV) is in a submarine; not too much fresh air available there!

 

I've paid very close attention to information about CO2 over the last 20 years or so because for many of those years, I worked for a  manufacturer of direct-fired heating equipment.  That type of heating is commonly used in industrial occupancies due to its exceptional efficiency (92%) and a few other factors.  One perceived downside of that equipment was that all of the combustion products, including CO2, are released into the occupied space, causing CO2 levels to rise, on occasion, to 2000ppm.

 

I also sat for several years on the ANSI Technical Advisory Group which wrote the current national standards for that equipment.  The member group of a couple dozen code officials, testing agency and manufacturing representatives conducted an extensive review of literature and found no evidence either in the literature or their collective experience that CO2 was a concern under 5000ppm.

 

In summary, my personal and fairly informed opinion is that the CO2 level in buildings is not even close to a health issue.  Follow ASHRAE Standard 62.1 and all will be well.  A recent post on this list referenced an article at buildingscience.com <http://buildingscience.com/>  by Joe Lstiburek which (I think rightly) points out the huge energy implications of introducing more air than indicated by Std 62.1; that's a bigger issue, I think.

 

p.s., I could not find any literature in my archives regarding a correlation between CO2 and drowsiness.  I don't think there's any literature indicating a strong correlation, certainly not at normal building concentrations.

All:

 

Thanks to Mr. Dirkes.

 

Can anyone direct us to a study that says high CO2 in and of itself does not cause health issues especially drowsiness?  We have asked for such a study from those providing filtration prior to considering such filtration on our projects.

 

I think CO2 is definitely related to energy use/modeling because you can reduce levels of outside air if allowing higher CO2 levels.

 

Thanks:

 

Wes

Dear Amit,

 

Keep in mind that ASHRAE's "acceptable" level of CO2 has almost nothing to do with health.  You could describe it as more of a "body odor" or "pleasantness" index.  When the ambient levels of CO2 exceed their recommendation (~1000 ppm), people start to feel that the indoor air is less pleasant or "stuffy".

 

Health does not start to be affected until CO2 exceeds 5000 ppm. (per US EPA and ACGIH)

Message-ID: <46913ebc1002161445y2c838f7as2510e08f54d5c97f@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I am trying to calculate with WINDOWS 6.2 the  thermal
and optical properties of a facade system. The system is composed by a
double pane glass and an exterior shading system. The shading is parallel to
the facade plane, it is 750 mm (2'6") detached form the glass and it is made
by a metal grid with openness factor that could range from 30% to 60%. The
goal is to see how the component properties are varying depending on
different grid's opening factors.

By doing that I have encountered these issues, any type of help would
be greatly appreciated:

1) Here in Italy the standard for glass calculation is the EN410 is there
any way to use it with WINDOWS 6.2? I have tried to copy the zip file from
the Windows knowledge base into the suggested folder but I am not seeing how
it is then possible to select the standard for the calculations.

2) Is there any settings available to automatically use Environmental
conditions as defined in EN410?

3) For some reasons, depending on the Environmental Condition that I am
selecting, there are some results in the calculation that are N/A. Is there
any reason for this?

4) To model the metal grid I am using the Woven Shade, is that the right
option? (This is actually the case I am modeling)

Thank you!

Regards,

Emanuele

Amit,

Healthcare facility ventilation requirements are often determined using the AIA/FGI Guidelines for Design and Construction of Health Care Facilities (full APA reference below), Table 2.1-2 (attached); not ASHRAE Standards. This table sets forth strict minimum outdoor air change per hour requirements for critical spaces (operating rooms, patient rooms, etc.). These outdoor air rates cannot be modified based on the CO2 levels in the zone.

Message-ID: <69a9bc0a1002170656n1f66021clcdbd0918484133b9@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with the LEED 2009 daylighting
calculations (IEQ 8.1).  I'm working on evaluating spaces using DiaLux
(option 1).  There are a number of inconsistencies between the various
compliance methodologies.

Option 1 - Simulation:  This method requires using a clear-sky condition,
even if clear-sky conditions are rare in a given climate, and require
calculation at 9am and 3pm
Option 2 - Prescriptive:  This method looks only at window and room
geometry, and does not take into account internal surface reflectance,
orientation, external shading, or sun angle at the particular lattitude
Option 3 - Measurement: no time of day or weather requirements are given for
measurement.  Measurement could be accomplished at any time of day, any time
of year, and under any sky conditions.


With option 1, there is a requirement to model the space at both 9am and
3pm.  I am a little unclear as to whether it is required to take an average
of the compliant areas between the two, or if the compliant area is
exclusionary.

Also, thoughts/opinions on the inconsistencies between the methods?

Thanks,

Karen

Dear Amit,

Next to the things already mentioned, hospital ventilation systems should have additional properties. For some rooms additional measures need to be taken. The operating theatres and the rooms around it need special care regarding surgical site infections. They basically are laboratory environments. If you do not have any experience in this area, consult with someone who has.

The relatively high ventilation rates in the patient wards can lead to draught problems that need to be taken into account. Patient wards with a lot of equipment (for example haemodialysis wards) might need extra cooling and thus possibly a higher ventilation rate.

Another thing to take into acount is the risk of cross-infection, both between wards and within a single ward with multiple patients. Some research on this topic has been done in Sheffield and in Copenhagen.

Kind regards,
Wiebe Zoon.

Amit,

I don't have the fundamentals here, but I recall a dinstinction is made for recommended ventilation rates based on the type of room considered: operating, recovery, ... Furthermore, I know specific requirements exist depending on the risk of infection for or from the patient.

So, I think you cannot simply state it as such. Maybe contact the research group of Jan Hensen (Technical University Eindhoven), I know they have worked on conditioning of operating rooms.

Good luck,

Leen Peeters

Dear Emanuele

I have been workin for some time with the fenestration programs from the 
LBNL and due to their hierarchy, a new layer should be defined in OPTICS, 
then comfined with other layers to create a glazing system also in OPTICS 
and finally imported to WINDOW, wehere frames are added..

Standars can be set in OPTICS, where i have just checked that EN410 is 
available.

If you wanted to create a metal grid, y would employ a new glass layer 
with solar transmitance equal to the hole fraction of the metallic 
element.

I?m sorry but I have no idea on how you can solve your 3rd question.

Kind regards,

Roberto Garay

[Bldg-sim] WINDOWS 6.2
Dear All,

I am trying to calculate with WINDOWS 6.2 the  thermal 
and optical properties of a facade system. The system is composed by a 
double pane glass and an exterior shading system. The shading is parallel 
to the facade plane, it is 750 mm (2'6") detached form the glass and it is 
made by a metal grid with openness factor that could range from 30% to 
60%. The goal is to see how the component properties are varying depending 
on different grid's opening factors.

By doing that I have encountered these issues, any type of help would 
be greatly appreciated:

1) Here in Italy the standard for glass calculation is the EN410 is there 
any way to use it with WINDOWS 6.2? I have tried to copy the zip file from 
the Windows knowledge base into the suggested folder but I am not seeing 
how it is then possible to select the standard for the calculations.

2) Is there any settings available to automatically use Environmental 
conditions as defined in EN410?

3) For some reasons, depending on the Environmental Condition that I am 
selecting, there are some results in the calculation that are N/A. Is 
there any reason for this?

4) To model the metal grid I am using the Woven Shade, is that the right 
option? (This is actually the case I am modeling)

Thank you!

Regards,

Emanuele

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fw: How to estimate performance of HVAC system in life
	cycle analysis?
Message-ID: <71299.91161.qm@web24008.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hello John,


Thanks for your reply,

I can get service life of equipments from Chapter 36 OWNING and OPERATING COSTS in ASHRAE 2007 HANDBOOK or http://xp20.ashrae.org/publicdatabase/.  But I am more interested to understand how the performance of HVAC systems changes during their life.  HVAC equipment performance normally degrades with use and time, at a rate depending on the quality of maintenance and operations.  Then for different conditions of equipments (best, normal, and worst), maybe simple degradation rate can be used to indicate how the efficiency of equipments (such as boiler efficiency, chiller COP, fan efficiency, pump efficiency) degrades with time.  Maybe there are some typical values from actual HVAC systems although there should be very uncertain in these degradation rates under actual conditions.  
1: Would you please let me know where I can find these degradation data for HVAC equipment performance?  
2: Or maybe it is fair to say that HVAC equipment efficiency would remain similar to the initial one during their life (about 20 years) under good and constant maintenance?  (I read some papers about how to calculate operating energy  from HVAC systems in life cycle analysis. Most researchers assume that annual operating energy is a constant during the building life.)  
3: Would you please give me some advice how to quantify or semi-quantify these performance change of HVAC equipment during their service life?

Thanks,

Jim Terrry

Hello all,


In life cycle analysis of buildings, it seems it is very hard to estimate long-term performance of HVAC systems (or other building components), for example, air handling units, chiller, or boilers.   It makes sense that HVAC system will degrade with time, depending on many factors, like maintainence, wear-and-tear.  The problem is how to quantify these change with time. Maybe some probabilstic or scenario methods can be used. Would you please tell me the common method to predict these performance change or where I can find some good references about this topic?

Thanks,

Jim Terrry

Clarification: It is not enough to set standard in OPTICS.  Think of OPTICS
as virtual glass laboratory.  It is used to define individual glass layers
and standard file in OPTICS is used to get broad band (integrated)
solar-optical properties.  However, that is for informational purposes only,
as the main purpose of OPTICS is to provide spectral data for individual
glass layers.  In order to correctly calculate glazing system solar-optical
properties (Transmittance, reflectance, absorptance, SHGC, VT) in WINDOW 5
or 6, you need to set correct spectrum standard in WINDOW as well
(Preferences/Optical Data/Standards File), otherwise the results will be
incorrect regardless of what was used in OPTICS.

 

Also, OPTICS is necessary only if you are creating glass layer that does not
exist in WINDOW glass library (such as laminates, applied films, measured
performance of new glasses, etc.).  Otherwise, it is an unnecessary extra
step.

My opinion:  

Performance of well-maintained equipment remains much the same as when it was new and can actually improve.  Performance of poorly maintained equipment can deteriorate within months by 20+%.  I cannot imagine any study / research which could accurately paint a picture of ?typical? that would be useful in energy modeling. For existing buildings, I measure the performance of critical and larger equipment.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] (Un)Conditioned Spaces?
Message-ID: <58161.85.101.134.51.1266525296.squirrel@webmail.mimtarch.com>

Dear All,

In my model I have areas in the core of the building that do not include
any HVAC equipment except exhaust fans (ie. toilets, pantries, storage
rooms)and that are in the normal sense unconditioned since there is no
control over space temperatures.

Reading ASHRAE User's Manual, one however gets the idea that such spaces
need to be modeled as conditioned for simulation (it says somewhere that
all spaces in climate zones 3-8 need to be assumed to be conditioned).

I am now at a loss on how to model these. For the sake of simplification,
I have also grouped such areas together (for example, three toilets, one
pantry and corridors together in one zone).

If I model these as "conditioned" in eQuest, am I supposed to assign them
to a HVAC system? Perhaps to the HVAC system of the neighboring
conditioned spaces? Can you please share your experiences with modelling
such areas? How should I model their exhaust fans?

Also, any experiences with assigning spaces "unconditioned" and getting
approval by USGBC?

Thank you,

Omer Moltay, LEED AP

Dear All,

Would you consider precision coolers in server rooms to be process energy?
This is how I would like to apply in my model for LEED EAc1 (essentially
not modelling any precision coolers and dumping it away under the default
25% value for process energy). Any opinions?

Thank you,

Hi Omer

Precision coolers/ACs in server rooms should not be counted under process
energy but if your baseline case HVAC system type is 5, 6, 7 or 8 (Table G
3.1.1A) you can model a separate HVAC system type for server rooms as per
exceptions to G3.1.1. This could be either system 3 or 4.

Regards

My opinion:? 
Performance of well-maintained equipment remains much the same as when it was new and can actually improve.? Performance of poorly maintained equipment can deteriorate within months by 20+%.? I cannot imagine any study / research which could accurately paint a picture of ?typical? that would be useful in energy modeling. For existing buildings, I measure the performance of critical and larger equipment.

Hello John,

Thanks for your reply,

I can get service life of equipments from Chapter 36 OWNING and OPERATING COSTS in ASHRAE 2007 HANDBOOK or http://xp20.ashrae.org/publicdatabase/.? But I am more interested to understand how the performance of HVAC systems changes during their life.? HVAC equipment performance normally degrades with use and time, at a rate depending on the quality of maintenance and operations.? Then for different conditions of equipments (best, normal, and worst), maybe simple degradation rate can be used to indicate how the efficiency of equipments (such as boiler efficiency, chiller COP, fan efficiency, pump efficiency) degrades with time.? Maybe there are some typical values from actual HVAC systems although there should be very uncertain in these degradation rates under actual conditions.? 
1: Would you please let me know where I can find these degradation data for HVAC equipment performance?? 
2: Or maybe it is fair to say that HVAC equipment efficiency would remain similar to the initial one during their life (about 20 years) under good and constant maintenance?? (I read some papers about how to calculate operating energy? from HVAC systems in life cycle analysis. Most researchers assume that annual operating energy is a constant during the building life.)? 
3: Would you please give me some advice how to quantify or semi-quantify these performance change of HVAC equipment during their service life?

Thanks,

Jim Terrry?

I don't have the reference right in front of me, but I believe the ASHRAE HVAC Systems has a table for useful life. Also the California Energy Commission. But my references are at work. Reemail me at jaulbach at ptrenergy.com to emind me, and I shall look them up for you.

Hello all,

In life cycle analysis of buildings, it seems it is very hard to estimate long-term performance of HVAC systems (or other building components), for example, air handling units, chiller, or boilers.?? It makes sense that HVAC system will degrade with time, depending on many factors, like maintainence, wear-and-tear.? The problem is how to quantify these change with time. Maybe some probabilstic or scenario methods can be used. Would you please tell me the common method to predict these performance change or where I can find some good references about this topic?

Thanks,

Jim Terrry

25% is the suggested minimum process energy use - the actual process use should be modeled, even if greater than 25%.

Thats a very interesting direction.
I think some topics would be baseline modeling for new and existing
buildings.(Appendix G)
Also, successful modeling using different modeling softwares available.

Lynn,

I tend to think that messages posted on Friday afternoons get generally unnoticed. However, this is an interesting proposal.

Regarding topics, it would be interesting to have some real cases where modeling results of new buildings are compared with utility bills obtained 1 or 2 years after construction, and lessons to learn from that.

As for  location, D.C., N.Y. or California seem right.

Hello Lynn,

 

Here is what I would be interested:

1.       Comparison of Energy simulation results with the actual
results. 

2.       What are the common hand calculations that an energy modeler
needs to do to verify the results?

3.       What are the most commonly type of problems energy modelers
face and how to tackle it when the software is unable to do it?

4.       What should one do when there is no weather data available for
a specific location?

5.       Impact of path followed by sun for various regions. 

 

I would say if you can plan for NY, or Vegas to bring in huge audience.
Reason being people like to have fun after attending such conference.

 

Thanks

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Precision Cooler - Big Disadvantage in Comparison to
	Baseline?
Message-ID: <49762.85.102.152.120.1266620237.squirrel@webmail.mimtarch.com>

Dear All,

My proposed model includes a 250 sq.ft. server room with 11,44 kw of
installed equipment (nameplate power). I assume that these will be running
24/7/365 with full power and giving away 100% sensible heat (noting these
to get your reactions on my assumptions as well).

This space is cooled by a 25 kW precision cooler with a COP of "1". With
such performance, this is a big time loser against what I am modeling for
the same space in the baseline with System 3. Actually, the SSH report
tells me that the precision cooler is using 90000 kWh p.a. for cooling
compared to 32600 kWh in the baseline model. However, we all know that in
real life such systems will never be used for server rooms.

Isn't this unfair? I am still considering whether this cooling energy
should be part of the process energy. There is actually a CIR from 2003:

--------------------------
4/11/2003 -  Credit Interpretation Request
Kelley Engineering Center is in design as a 144,000 s.f. university
research and teaching building. This project includes a 2200 s.f. data
center with racks of servers, and a uninterruptible power supply room.
This area has dedicated cooling equipment to extract the heat produced by
all of the electronics. Given the nature of the space, and the purpose of
the cooling equipment, it appears to meet the definition of a process
load, and can be excluded under ASHRAE 90.1 from the energy cost budget
for this credit. Do you agree with this interpretation?

5/5/2003 -  Ruling
Yes, as described the dedicated server room air conditioning equipment
fits the ASHRAE 90.1-1999 definition of "process load." As such it can be
excluded from the project's Energy Cost Budget.
------------------------------

What do you think about this? What are your experiences with server room
air conditioning and modelling for LEED?

Thanks for all the answers and happy weekend,

Omer Moltay, LEED AP

Lynn,

I imagine you are already familiar with IBPSA's SimBuild conference which
are also energy modeling conferences. If not, you can find info about them
on the IBPSA web site. Would ASHRAE try to make their conferences unique
from IBPSAs in some way? If you could maybe I would consider attending
another conference, if not I probably wouldn't be able to afford it. In any
case, be sure to pick a site that is inexpensive to fly to and stay at. Many
of us modelers are self employed or work for cost conscious companies and
it's hard to justify a lot of expense. If we are self employed we are also
losing income for the duration of the conference so it's kind of a double
hit. For this reason I would also hope that ASHRAE would make every attempt
to keep the conference fee as low as possible. Just some food for thought.

Regards

Carol Gardner

Dear Lynn:

 From the teaching aspect of energy modeling, and only if you are willing
to target other people than consulting engineering practitioners, I
would recommend presentations on integrating energy modeling with
architecture/engineering design in the classrooms.

I am aware that some of you engineers are developing incredible skills
in energy modeling. So, introducing simplified techniques and short
exercises within the scope of a classroom will be welcomed by faculty
and students alike and would help the education aspect of energy
modeling.

Just a thought,

Nader

Dear Lynn,

 

I'd agree with James on this.  Model calibration is something that is a bit
of a dark art.  We carry it out for some projects, but it isn't easy in many
tools (not even in E+, though we have done it a number of times in this) and
I'm sure a lot of people would benefit this.

 

Unfortunately I don't think you could teach a healthy scepticism of results.
That comes naturally or not.

 

In terms of location.  Somewhere that us in the UK can get to easily and
affordably would be nice.

 

Cheers

Paul

As far as assumptions go you'll have to evaluate for yourself if the nameplate power consumption is the appropriate value for 24/7 operation.

That CIR is from LEED 2.1 which used ASHRAE 90.1-1999 and the energy cost budget method, where process energy (at whatever percentage) was not included in the savings calculation.  Personally I agree that cooling provided only for a process, could also be treated as process energy.  However the newer versions of LEED specifically include process energy in the savings calculations.  If you are using LEED 2.1, go ahead and stop here.

This CIR and methodology do not apply to LEED NC 2.2 or 3.0 which include all process energy.  25% is a minimum, and the project should include the expected amount of process energy if it is greater than 25%.  Treatment of the server cooling system as process energy won't gain you anything...the percentage calculation will be the same under 2.2 or 3.0.

The part of your question that I don't understand is if your project is using LEED, why select cooling equipment with a COP of 1.0?  Regarding your cooling system, it sounds like the equipment selection is not in line with the project goals rather than receiving a penalty from the rating system.  If the selected precision unit is really the only option, it will have to be made up for elsewhere in the project.

Dear all,

for a student project, we are studying the options for improving the thermal
comfort in a hospital located in Bangladesh. The aim is to use as much cheap
and local materials as possible.
They currently use simple metal non-insulated constructions. We will go
there and build a extension to an existing hospital. The idea is to use
bricks for the walls, wooden doors and single glazing. However the roof
remains in metal. We have a small budget for improving the indoor climate,
however have no experience in insulation in these climates.

We would appreciate anyones help; references to reports, publications or
some usefull advice.

Kind regards,

Aushim

 *About the workshop*

The four days workshop is an opportunity to learn how to perform energy
simulation of buildings for LEED and ECBC through hands-on training on
energy simulation tools and case studies. Besides sailing through the
process of building energy simulation up to report preparation stage, the
workshop would also cover fundamental concepts related to building physics
required to utilize these simulation tools. This course focuses on the
skills and knowledge required for carrying out energy simulations for LEED
and ECBC.

 Some common questions which will be answered through interactive exercises
are:

   - How much detailing is required for energy modeling
   - What are the impacts of lighting, internal loads, occupancy schedules
   on energy consumption
   - How to analyze simulation results and propose energy conservation
   measure (ECMs).
   - How to rank ECMs on life cycle cost basis

We would be more than happy to furnish any further detail/clarification in
this regard, if required.

best greetings,

Hi David,

Thank you for taking the time to answer. Well, I was also curious about
the COP of "1", double checked it with the manufacturer's representative
and it turns out that they misprinted the brochures with EER instead of
COP. (EER = 3,41 when they wanted to say COP = 3,41).

Now we are not penalized any more.

Thanks,

Omer Moltay, LEED AP




As far as assumptions go you'll have to evaluate for yourself if the
nameplate power consumption is the appropriate value for 24/7 operation.

That CIR is from LEED 2.1 which used ASHRAE 90.1-1999 and the energy cost
budget method, where process energy (at whatever percentage) was not
included in the savings calculation.  Personally I agree that cooling
provided only for a process, could also be treated as process energy. 
However the newer versions of LEED specifically include process energy in
the savings calculations.  If you are using LEED 2.1, go ahead and stop
here.

This CIR and methodology do not apply to LEED NC 2.2 or 3.0 which include
all process energy.  25% is a minimum, and the project should include the
expected amount of process energy if it is greater than 25%.  Treatment of
the server cooling system as process energy won't gain you anything...the
percentage calculation will be the same under 2.2 or 3.0.

The part of your question that I don't understand is if your project is
using LEED, why select cooling equipment with a COP of 1.0?  Regarding
your cooling system, it sounds like the equipment selection is not in line
with the project goals rather than receiving a penalty from the rating
system.  If the selected precision unit is really the only option, it will
have to be made up for elsewhere in the project.

Message-ID: <53668.88.233.18.84.1266869687.squirrel@webmail.mimtarch.com>

Dear All,

Just want to have your opinions about this: Since the building we are
applying for LEED certification is an existing building (and there are no
additions), the building envelope in our baseline model is identical to
the existing conditions in real life. We have interpreted this to also
include the SHGC on the windows and any fixed shading devices on the
windows, so these we have also modeled as existing in real life.

I assume this would further mean that when we are doing the baseline
simulation in four rotations, we do not need to change anything with the
SHGC's on the windows in each rotation.

Although according to Appendix G I believe this should be the way (since
the remark involving existing buildings is printed as the last entry in
the table), I still have some doubts as in the LEED NC reference guide
they have only printed that remark for the building envelope involving
opaque surfaces, and the criteria involving windows seems to be
independent of this (on p.270).

Thanks for any replies,

Omer Moltay, LEED AP

Hello,

 

I've "grown-up" in the time when energy modeling programs always
existed.  I'm curious if anyone that has been in the business for awhile
has any experience using spreadsheets to estimate a building's energy
consumption, and if so, would you be so kind as to share them with me?
I'm not looking to use it on any projects and would not try to hold

tackled the issue of estimating energy usage, other than degree days,
before the popularization of DOE and other energy modeling programs.
Plus I think it would just be fun to play around with what other people

Hi Dan,

 

I believe the approach you may be looking for information on is called Bin
Analysis or Modified Bin Analysis.  With this approach, you can use
spreadsheets to estimate energy use based on the number of hours each year
an area spends within a temperature bin.  Correlations between
weather-dependent loads (ventilation CFM, CHW loads, HW loads) can be
estimated, or better yet, calibrated using building trends or metered data.

 

More complex bin models can include detailed envelope calculations,
occupancy and internal load diversity schedules, and regressions that
estimate chiller, heat rejection, fan and pump energy based on part-load
performance data obtained from manufacturers or metered data (existing
buildings) and good engineering judgement.  In my experiences, it isn't
uncommon to have an 'occupied' and 'unoccupied' bin model for the same
project.

 

You may be able to find some ASHRAE literature on the topic on the internet
or through libraries.  Unfortunately, I don't have any examples at hand that
I can provide to you for your review.

 

John

I attended an Energy in Architecture course given by AIA in 1982.  I still
have the manual.

The energy calculations section includes a two page worksheet to do a
building block cooling load , a one page worksheet to do a building block
heating load, worksheets for annual heating loads using degree day method
and annual cooling loads using equivalent full load operating hour method,
and appropriate tables from ASHRAE.  

Looking it over I got a good laugh out of the last page - circles with marks
around the circumference (0-100) to be used for pie charts to show energy
costs by end use.

 

I had already started DOE2 (or should I say CAL-ERDA) for several years
prior to the course, but this was run on a main frame, and many people were
doing energy calc's by hand (remember - this was before PCs and
spreadsheets).

Things were very primitive back then.

Hello!

There is a good reason people don't use spreadsheet analyses very much
anymore for building modeling.  I used bin models for many years to
estimate HVAC energy use and kept improving my technique until I arrived at
what was dubbed the Osama bin Model approach.  In the end, I ditched this
to learn how to do things right in eQuest.

What was the big lesson?  Bin models at best are big sloppy averaging
exercises that use first principals (read: "easy math") to determine
operation at any one point in time.  This is cool for ventilation
calculations where the loads are instantaneous and related directly to
ambient conditions, but definitely not a good way to model the impacts of
anything that has time lags/delayed responses.  How do you estimate the
benefit of commercial building envelope upgrades?  Most savings arise
during unoccupied periods, primarily from reduced cycling of fans, pumps,
cooling systems, and boilers.  Sure there are reduced heating/cooling
loads, but how do you estimate the heat loss when you can't estimate what
the average interior temperature is going to be?

Yeah, spreadsheet calcs definitely have their place and I still do use
them.  I have found that eQuest is a whole lot faster and more accurate
than the ol' Osama bin Model when doing whole-building analyses.

Eric

Dan:
 
As much as I LOVE to spend time (billable?) creating complex and clunkly
fragile spreadsheets to meet my own rapid prototyping energy analysis needs,
I feel obligated to caution you to think very carefully about economics
before using heading down a path of using a spreadsheets developed by
'others' as a basis for much of anything. Your time might be better spent
studying and exploring what is 'beneath the hoods of popular and well
documented whole building energy simulation programs.  
 
Having said that, I strongly believe anyone seriously interested in
mastering skills for estimating building energy should have a strong
understanding of the many available tools, and an awareness of the evolution
of those tools. (*How did we get here?)  I can share a few of my favorite
resources developing an understanding of alternatives to 'full blown' 8760
analysis tools and how they work. 
 
1) ASHRAE RP-363: If you are an ASHRAE memeber, consider downloading RP-363
documentation (ASEAM). This text lays out the methodologies for estimating
loads, systems, plants, control strategies and so forth. It's an 'oldie but
a goodie'. 
 
Login -> Bookstore -> Papers and Articles -> Memebers Only Free Access to
Research Projects, Final Reports, 
 
Search for the term "363" - you are looking for this: RP-363 -- Upgrading
Documentation of the Proposed TC 4.7 Simplified Energy Analysis Procedure 
 
Chapter One has a nice section laying out the foundations for some
alternatives to hourly analysis, as well a discussion on limitations. If you
REALLY want to build your own spreadsheet model for estimating building
energy consumption, this book should be in your arsenal. 
 
2) Volume 1 and Volume 2 of the "ARCHITECT'S AND ENGINEER'S GUIDE TO ENERGY
CONSERVATION IN EXISTING BUILDINGS"
http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/DOE/TECH/doe_v1.pdf
http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/DOE/TECH/doe_v2.pdf
 
These 2 guides were written over 20 years ago and for the ASEAM software. A
suprising amount of descriptive information from these guides continues to
be relevant today . Section 4.2 of Volume one has a nice description if
alternative calculation methods. 
 
Best,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Estimating Energy Consumption Using Spreadsheets



Hello,

 

I've "grown-up" in the time when energy modeling programs always existed.
I'm curious if anyone that has been in the business for awhile has any
experience using spreadsheets to estimate a building's energy consumption,
and if so, would you be so kind as to share them with me?  I'm not looking
to use it on any projects and would not try to hold anyone liable for any
results.  I'm just curious as to how people tackled the issue of estimating
energy usage, other than degree days, before the popularization of DOE and
other energy modeling programs.  Plus I think it would just be fun to play
around with what other people have used. 

 

Thank you in advance,

Dan Croisant

Hello Myrene,

It is acceptable to use PV Watts or RetScreen to calculate the PV
electricity output. Using one of these (free) software tools would be an
exceptional calculation method.

I know that the use of PV Watts is acceptable.  Not sure about RetScreen off
the top of my head.

 

You would only need to follow the ECM  if you modeled the PVs within the
energy modeling software (model the proposed building without PV and enter
it in the LEED form, model the proposed with the PV and enter the difference
in the renewable energy portion of the form).  If it is modeled externally
simply enter the savings in the renewable energy portion of the form.

Hello Bldg-Sim community,
We are doing Energy Modeling for a LEED project. They currently have R-22
(HCFC) refrigerant in their chiller. EA Prerequisite states that
 " When reusing existing base building HVAC equipment, complete the
comprehensive CFC phase out conversion prior to completion of project". A
table follows two pages later stating the refrigerants with their ODP, GWP
and applications. The table shows that R-22 is HCFC, i understand that R-22
is going to be phased out and only recycled could be used in future where
the replacement with other refrigerants is not economically feasible (more
than 10 yeras of payback) but does the prerequisite means that HCFC
refrigerants like R-22(not sure if this is considered same as CFC's ??) has
to be phased out before completion of project to satisfy the prerequisites
for EA credits in LEED .

Any help in this regard is appreciated.

Aushim,

Attached is a link to a paper that I wrote with Baruch Givoni for PLEA in 2002. It explains how you can use a metal roof for cooling by adding an operable radiant barrier underneath. The aluminum foil opens to cool the space by radiation during the night and closes to provide a radiant barrier during the day. Results were good and the system was tested with different levesl of insulation in the walls. 

http://www.csupomona.edu/~pmlaroche/rdocs/PLEA_LaRoche_Givoni1.pdf

Hope it helps and let me know if you want to know more about the system.

Dear all,
 
for a student project, we are studying the options for improving the
thermal comfort in a hospital located in Bangladesh. The aim is to use
as much cheap and local materials as possible.  
They currently use simple metal non-insulated constructions. We will go
there and build a extension to an existing hospital. The idea is to use
bricks for the walls, wooden doors and single glazing. However the roof
remains in metal. We have a small budget for improving the indoor
climate, however have no experience in insulation in these climates.
 
We would appreciate anyones help; references to reports, publications or
some usefull advice.
 
Kind regards,

Aushim,

Great Project.

I do not know if this is at all helpful, but when we think about latent
load even in the southern U.S., we focus on air tightness and
pre-dehumidification of incoming air.  

Ground coupled PEX tubing into a pre-chiller on the ERV intake
(basically a car radiator type gizmo, pump 1/4 hp, water in tubing at
ground temp (go deep with picks and shovels...), no heat pump), ERV (25
watts per 2000 SF) can create a steady flow of fresh air and probably
get the temp. down to 85F and control humidity.  Positive pressure flow
(0.5 Pa) to the interior to keep out humidity when doors open
frequently.  American retail for the pre-chiller is $250 U.S. ; the ERV
is $1800 U.S.Both the ERV and pump can be DC powered.  The intake on the
ERV is MERV 12 filtered (so you are two away from MERV 14 or hospital
standard...reduces the burn rate on MERV 14 filters) , the MERV 12
filters can be removed and hand-washed.  Sealed bearings (no dust
effect), self-balancing.  It is 96% efficient on the sensible heat
exchange, 40% on the latent exchange.  We know the head engineer, they
will love this project.

Skin the brick with wood spacers and corrugated metal (1" spacing - like
a vented rain screen - Bernoulli effect through the corrugations -
vertical venting),  air tighten the single pane windows, big overhangs
(check the depth here: http://susdesign.com/tools.php) and a layered
roof strategy (say, 3 layers, perpendicular to one another, corrugated
metal with wood spacers...again, Bernoulli affect)...

Use air to create the insulation...give me a week to run a Passive House
model and give you rough sawn numbers on wall assemblies...I take it you
really need this bare bones and repairable...but it is critical to
control the air flows through the envelope...do that, and you have a
fighting chance to make something amazing.

PS - dimensions? aspect ratio? how many floors? window percentage? do
you plaster the interiors? orientation?

Use air to create the insulation...give me a week to run a Passive House model and give you rough sawn numbers on wall assemblies...I take it you really need this bare bones and repairable...but it is critical to control the air flows through the envelope...do that, and you have a fighting chance to make something amazing. 

PS - dimensions? aspect ratio? how many floors? window percentage? do you plaster the interiors? orientation?

Dear all,

They currently use simple metal non-insulated constructions.?We will go there and build a extension to an existing hospital. The idea?is to use bricks for the walls, wooden doors and single glazing. However the roof remains in metal. We have a small budget for improving the indoor climate, however have no experience in insulation in these climates.

As far as expecting honest straight forward answers from utility 
companies about how much energy you're using month to month and year to 
year.....
don't hold your breath !! A "major" electric utility in Northern 
Virginia changes the number of days in a particular month's bill from 
year to year.
The only place the number of days is shown is on the original bill. The 
previous 11 months shown on each bill have an unknown and variable 
number of days.
18 month and 24 month summaries did not show the number of days in each 
bill until I got a meeting with a new , Republican , County Supervisor.

The weather data for my location, Sterling VA, next huge Dulles Airport 
came chopped up into over 15 separate data files due to outages......
They actually don't have UPS backup power or redundant sensors for much 
of the "continuous data" that started in ? 1991 ??

Hello Brent,

I agree that DOE2 does not perform the same degree of calculations as E+ or
other newer calculation engines, but it does allow us to get a reasonably
accurate estimate of savings for a wide range of design options without
having to wait hours for results.  In addition, we can access intermediate
results to diagnose modeling problems or check to see if we are modeling
unique systems correctly.  We will switch to E+ when it can run as fast as
eQuest and/or when there is a user interface that allows us to model a wide
array of HVAC systems and easily check intermediate results.  

I am curious, do you or anyone else over at NREL have comparisons of
projected savings generated using DOE2 and E+ for the same base and proposed
case envelope designs calibrated to actual energy use of a real building?
We may switch from eQuest if there is evidence that there is a substantial
difference in the accuracy of energy savings estimates.

It is my understanding that the E+ FORTRAN code is an agglomeration of DOE
programming from the past 30 years that may not be operating as smoothly as
it could be.  Do you know if there are any efforts underway to speed up the
processing time?

Oh this is hilarious, "do things right in eQuest."   sounds impossible,
eQuest may be better than spreadsheets of yore,  but it is hardly state of

thermal comfort results?

Hello!

There is a good reason people don't use spreadsheet analyses very much
anymore for building modeling.  I used bin models for many years to estimate
HVAC energy use and kept improving my technique until I arrived at what was
dubbed the Osama bin Model approach.  In the end, I ditched this to learn
how to do things right in eQuest.

What was the big lesson?  Bin models at best are big sloppy averaging
exercises that use first principals (read: "easy math") to determine
operation at any one point in time.  This is cool for ventilation
calculations where the loads are instantaneous and related directly to
ambient conditions, but definitely not a good way to model the impacts of
anything that has time lags/delayed responses.  How do you estimate the
benefit of commercial building envelope upgrades?  Most savings arise during
unoccupied periods, primarily from reduced cycling of fans, pumps, cooling
systems, and boilers.  Sure there are reduced heating/cooling loads, but how
do you estimate the heat loss when you can't estimate what the average
interior temperature is going to be?

Yeah, spreadsheet calcs definitely have their place and I still do use them.
I have found that eQuest is a whole lot faster and more accurate than the
ol' Osama bin Model when doing whole-building analyses.

Eric

Hello,

I've "grown-up" in the time when energy modeling programs always existed.
I'm curious if anyone that has been in the business for awhile has any
experience using spreadsheets to estimate a building's energy consumption,
and if so, would you be so kind as to share them with me?  I'm not looking
to use it on any projects and would not try to hold anyone liable for any
results.  I'm just curious as to how people tackled the issue of estimating
energy usage, other than degree days, before the popularization of DOE and
other energy modeling programs.  Plus I think it would just be fun to play
around with what other people have used.

Thank you in advance,

I'd guess that, back when DOE2 took an hour to run, this sort of reasoning was often used to justify hanging on to spreadsheets.

The 'hilarious' thing is that EnergyPlus was introduced with much fanfare in
2001.  At the time it was described as a program designed to be used with an
interface (though I noticed that now they it's a "stand alone program
without a 'user friendly' graphical intrerface").  
Nine years later we're still waiting for a fully functional interface!

Message-ID: <58110.85.102.159.42.1267030832.squirrel@webmail.mimtarch.com>

Dear All,

I would like to get your opinions on whether my interpretation of the
following regarding G3.1.2.8 is correct:

My proposed building is conditioned by fan coils and air handler unit
providing ventilation air. In such a system, there are only supply fans
(AHU supply, FCU supply) and exhaust fans (AHU exhaust). There is no
recirculation.

For the baseline case, according to G3.1.1A, I am modeling System 5 -
Packaged VAV with reheat. I am confused about whether to model return fans
with this.

G3.1.2.8 says that if the proposed case has return/relief fans, then the
baseline case should be modeled with these as well.

Does this mean I need to count the exhaust fans in proposed as
return/relief fans and model these in baseline as well in line with
G3.1.2.8?

Thank you for any replies,

We always said it was an "engine" for calculations.  Designed to be 
the engine.  Look at our documentation if you think otherwise.

And 3rd parties, at their request, were to step up to the plate and 
provide those interfaces all the domain users love so much.  The 
Government has been highly criticized for any attempts to produce 
full scale commercial software and step on others toes.

Go 
to 
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/interfaces_tools.cfm 
to see how far private industry has progressed in terms of providing 
interfaces.

My understanding is The baseline building needs to have the fan power of all fans, supply, return and/or exhaust modeled in accordance with G3.1.2.9.  It doesn't really matter if they are return or exhaust.  The proposed fan power should be modeled exactly as designed.

I think the exhaust fans in your proposed building would be the equivalent of having relief fans in the baseline system. So the Baseline should have supply and relief fans, with no return fans.

Hi, Lynn.

 

How about a session on the state of the art in modeling natural ventilation
and mixed-mode systems in hourly simulations. Ideally with some case studies
and validation.

Hello Aushim,

 

I suspect Bangladesh has a tropical monsoon climate, which I don't have any
information for.  But, prescriptive requirements for the tropical island
location of Kingston Jamaica are as follows:

 

WALLS:                 No. insulation, if solar absorptivity < 0.7

WINDOWS:         clear glass with internal blinds, Window-to-Wall ratio <
0.35

ROOF (metal):   (a) No skylights, U-value = 0.12 Btu/hr-sq-ft-degF, solar
absorptivity < 0.7; or

                                (b) Skylights with U-value = 0.8
Btu/hr-sq-ft-degF, 2% of roof,

Dear all,

 

for a student project, we are studying the options for improving the thermal
comfort in a hospital located in Bangladesh. The aim is to use as much cheap
and local materials as possible.  

They currently use simple metal non-insulated constructions. We will go
there and build a extension to an existing hospital. The idea is to use
bricks for the walls, wooden doors and single glazing. However the roof
remains in metal. We have a small budget for improving the indoor climate,
however have no experience in insulation in these climates.

 

We would appreciate anyones help; references to reports, publications or
some usefull advice.

 

Kind regards,

 

Aushim

You might consider a solar chimney.  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_chimney 

 

You would want to minimize air leakage in the building envelope to
maximize the draw of cool air from underground.

 

I think I've seen configurations where there is no actual chimney, but
rather a chimney effect is realized by a vent located in the top of the
wall across the room from the vent from the underground.  (Same as shown
above, but with no actual chimney constructed on the outside of the
building.)  Since you will have a metal roof, you should have a lot of
hot air at the ceiling that will ventilate when the cool air vent is
opened on the floor thus cooling the room.

Hello Aushim,

 

I suspect Bangladesh has a tropical monsoon climate, which I don't have
any information for.  But, prescriptive requirements for the tropical
island location of Kingston Jamaica are as follows:

 

WALLS:                 No. insulation, if solar absorptivity < 0.7

WINDOWS:         clear glass with internal blinds, Window-to-Wall ratio
< 0.35

ROOF (metal):   (a) No skylights, U-value = 0.12 Btu/hr-sq-ft-degF,
solar absorptivity < 0.7; or

                                (b) Skylights with U-value = 0.8
Btu/hr-sq-ft-degF, 2% of roof, 

opaque roof U-value = 0.09 Btu/hr-sq-ft-degF, solar absorptivity < 0.45

This cannot be answered until you know whether there will be 
airconditioning or not. For air-conditioned spaces, single-glazing 
sounds costly, for non air-conditioned spaces, insulating would be 
probably by far less interesting then controling air-flow. As far as I 
found, you have a climate with strong temperature drops over about half 
year, so there is a potential for using this as long as you have 
sufficient mass (a metal roof e.g. does not offer much here, but that 
may be fine).

Cheers, Lars.
