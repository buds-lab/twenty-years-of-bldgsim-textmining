<I could schedule evaporation rates but that would be difficult to get
right as evaporation rate will change with indoor air humidity which in
turn depends on ventilation air humidity (we will provide ventilation air
at 2.5 l/s per m2 of pool and deck area as per NZ standards) >

Brent,

I know you were originally asking about a swimming pool model for Energy+,
but I do know the TRNSYS program has a good swimming pool model that you
can couple to the building model in order to get the correct evaporation
rates and the associated evaporative cooling effect modeled correctly. 
Give us a shout if you have questions about the model.  We're currently
using the pool model in a project where we recapture the waste heat off an
ice rink cooling system to both heat the pool and provide domestic hot
water for a rec center.

I am working on a 70,000 sq ft health sciences building.  This building has a wide range of room types, from lecture halls of 90 people to simulation labs and offices with maybe one or two people.  I am using eQuest to model this building for LEED.  The proposed system for this building is a two part system.  The main air handler is a cooling only VAV.  We also have a second air handler for outside air.  These two ducted systems mix at each zone where there is a reheat coil.  Is there a way to model this type of system in eQuest?  The DCV settings are either set by critical zone or by return air.  Neither of these is an accurate representation of the existing system.  We will likely have situations where the lecture halls will be receiving 100% outside air while other rooms need only a small fraction of OA.  I have seen mention of dummy zones, but this doesn't seem like an accurate method to me.  Please let me know if you have any tips on this.

Take the fan energy from the DOAS and put it in with the systems it serves

The following post is being done for Marlin Addison

Sorry to be slow in responding to this eQUEST training question. The current list of scheduled public events that I am instructing is provided below. I am not aware of any other events focused on eQUEST training. 

 

I prefer to arrange eQUEST training so that, like eQUEST itself, the training gets delivered at a low cost to the participants. I have found that presenting workshops online to be much less effective than in-person events. Online events seem best for limited sessions, i.e., 1 to 2 hours. Considering the potential to reduce travel-related emissions, we (the eQUEST development team) will undoubtedly expand this vehicle for training. This option seems especially attractive for international users. 

 

Low cost in-person public events usually require a local sponsor willing to underwrite some or all of the costs. If anyone can suggest a potential sponsor, e.g., utility, state energy office, university or community college, or local chapters of USGBC, ASHRAE, AIA, etc., please let me know and I'll work with you to get a public eQUEST event organized. 

 

Regarding training materials, the main items I rely on are publicly available at DOE2.com (i.e., the Overview and Introductory Tutorial) or soon will be. Two new items include the 'eQUEST Modeling Procedures Quick Reference Guide' and the 'eQUEST Life-Cycle Cost Tutorial'. Both are temporarily available at 

http://doe2.com/msa/eQUEST-Modeling-Procedures-Quick-Ref-Guide.zip (~8 MB)

http://doe2.com/msa/eQUEST-Life-Cycle-Cost-Tutorial.zip  (~7 MB)

 

These two new items will become part of the setup.exe file for the next version of eQUEST (i.e., part of the eQUEST download). Once the next version of eQUEST is posted, the links above will be removed. An annotated example set of SIM file reports that I use in training seminars will be updated and also included in the v3.62 download. 

 

The scope of these training and tutorial items has caused me to limit eQUEST training events to 'Introductory' and 'Intermediate' classes. Later this year I intend to add sufficient material to the Quick Reference Guide to provide suitable examples for a more advanced eQUEST class. Suggestions for topics to add to the Quick Reference Guide would be welcomed. 

 

Regarding qualifications to teach an eQuest course, the eQUEST development group doesn't vet or recommend ANY eQUEST consultants or trainers. Just as anyone can offer eQUEST-based consulting services, anyone should feel free to provide eQUEST training. 

 

Regarding the next version of eQUEST, version 3.62, we've been delayed by ongoing parallel development work but plan to post a new version of eQUEST in the 'very near' future.  

 

To reiterate, if anyone can suggest a potential sponsor for a public eQUEST training event, let me know and I'll work with you to get something organized in your area. In the past, this suggestion has usually lead to in-house events that end up closed to the public. To facilitate public events, I will begin to limit the in-house events I present, so if you can suggest a sponsor for a public eQUEST event, please contact me and I will follow-up.

	Report

I recently came across a report from Bonneville Power 
Administration, BPA, titled "Guidelines for Energy 
Simulation of Commercial Buildings" by Michael Kaplan and 
Phoebe Caner.  The report contains good pragmatic 
information on performing building energy simulation and how 
to increase the quality of input and results. It often 
echoes hard lessons I have learned.  While the report was 
written in 1992 it is a testament that sometimes good advice 
is timeless.

I have posted a PDF of the report but since it a scan it may 
take a while to download.

http://www.onebuilding.org/GuidelinesForEnergySimulation.pdf

It's worth the download.

I've been playing with it for a while and like it.  It has a couple of 
nifty additions including basing parametric runs on alternate 
simulations.  The parametric run setups are easier to put together. 

So far, no downsides, although there was a patch needed to add to the 
\Screens directory to fix a problem with disappearing chiller parametric 
runs.  (Scott -- did I ever tell you that the patch worked?  Thanks!)

To All

 

Is there any documentation on Day Schedule types in eQuest?

 

I'm trying to set up interior motorized shading, which seems to require
an assigned schedule.  However, I do not know which schedule type should
be used to control it.  (By schedule type I mean the "Type" pull-down
menu under the Day Schedules tab-On/Off, Fraction, Multiplier, etc.

 

If there is no documentation, any experience with any of the types would
be helpful.

 

Thanks!!

I struggled with a similar bug with disappearing LIGHTING-W/AREA [N] and
LIGHTING-SCHEDULE [N] in the Category column of the grid on Parametric Runs
Definition screen. There was the same issue with EQUIPMENT inputs. Is there
a patch for that? Otherwise it looks great!

I've been playing with it for a while and like it.  It has a couple of nifty
additions including basing parametric runs on alternate simulations.  The
parametric run setups are easier to put together. 

So far, no downsides, although there was a patch needed to add to the
\Screens directory to fix a problem with disappearing chiller parametric
runs.  (Scott -- did I ever tell you that the patch worked?  Thanks!)

I have added information to the WINDOW 5.2 Knowledge Base explaining how to
generate the DOE-2 input file from WINDOW. Here is the Knowledge Base URL:

http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/52/W52_faq.html

There is a DOE-2 section at the top, and the first link in that section is
to the page explaining how to make the input file from WINDOW.

Sorry for the confusion.

1. )  In WINDOW, click on 'Libraries' at the top and then click on
(check mark) 'Window F2'

2.)  Once the window system has been developed, click on the 'REPORT'
icon on the left side and then make sure that the Report Type is 'DOE-2'

3.)  Give this file a unique name and it will be ready for import into
eQuest.

Again, sorry for the confusion on the previous e-message.

Hi Paul,

I don't understand what you mean by:

 "import a file from Window into EQuest using a "Glazing System" file
from WINDOW rather than the "Window" (whole product) file from WINDOW

When you then go on to say: " click the
Report button and specify Report Type = DOE"

If you try to report a glazing system it will only allow you to do this
as a "detailed" report. Whereas the "Window" (whole product) allows you
to do the DOE report!

I'm trying to do this too and it doesn't seem to work. I have done it
before but I don't seem to be able to do it again!

Kind Regards,
Kevin

Robin Mitchell from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was gracious
enough to previously help me with somewhat of the same question.

Import a file from WINDOW into Bequest using a "Glazing System" file
from WINDOW rather than the "Window" (whole product) file from WINDOW.

You need to generate this file from the Window Library -- click the
Report button and specify Report Type = DOE, save that file under
whatever name you wish, and then it is ready for import it into Bequest.

In the detailed mode of bequest, go to the BUILDING SHELL icon, scroll
down to 'Glass Types' on the left side and right click on the 'Import a
Window 4/5 Report file...'

Hopefully this helps.

For documentation on schedule TYPE, see the DOE-2.2 Documentation, Volume 2,
or in the Detailed Interface right click on the TYPE input on any schedule,
week-schedule, or day-schedule dialog and select Item Help for that input.
On the HTML help screen, explore the Contents tree if necessary to read
about related items. 

 

Whenever a 'what schedule type applies' question arises, in the Detailed
Interface, first navigate to the input that accepts the schedule assignment
(e.g., the Shading Schedule input for a Window), right click and select
"View Default/Range". This will display a dialog that includes info about
the Data Type, including a statement that says "The compatible subtypes are
.". This will identify what schedule TYPEs are acceptable for the schedule
input on which you right clicked.

To All

 

Is there any documentation on Day Schedule types in eQuest?

 

I'm trying to set up interior motorized shading, which seems to require an
assigned schedule.  However, I do not know which schedule type should be
used to control it.  (By schedule type I mean the "Type" pull-down menu
under the Day Schedules tab-On/Off, Fraction, Multiplier, etc.

 

If there is no documentation, any experience with any of the types would be
helpful.

 

Thanks!!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Steam Boilers to Reheat Convertor
Message-ID: <47A34FCE.E70E.0034.0@aeieng.com>

Hello all,

Here is my situation.

I have boilers generating steam.  The steam is used for process loads such as autoclaves and domestic hot water.  The steam is also used directly in my air handling units for humidification, and some of my air handlers have steam preheat coils.  In addition, the steam is being used at hot water heat exchangers for my reheat hot water system.

How should I model this in my waterside systems?

The way I have done this so far is that my primary heating loop is from two steam boilers.  Attached to this primary loop are the autoclaves/domestic hot water heaters as direct loads and the air handling unit humidifiers and preheat coils.  For my reheat loop I have created a secondary loop off the primary loop.  I modeled the reheat loop with 180 degree supply temperature with a loop design DT of 50 in accordance with ASHRAE 90.1-2004 G3.1.3.3.  I've also got the hot water supply temperature reset programmed in accordance with ASHRAE 90.1-2004 G3.1.3.4.  On my reheat loop I've programmed the "% Transfer to Primary" as 100%.

Have I modeled this water system correctly?

Here are my worries.

1.) The "% Transfer to Primary" indicates to me that I shouldn't be trying to create a reheat loop secondary loop off a steam loop primary loop.  Based on the DOE-2 help for the "% Transfer to Primary" this function operates on gpm's and loop DT's.  My steam loop doesn't have a gpm, but more importantly I don't have a delta-T on my steam loop.  Saturated steam temperature is 350 F, and the saturated condensate temperature (in theory) is 350 F.  So I don't really have a delta-T.  How do I accurately specify % Transfer to Primary under this type of system?

2.)  Also, if I specify my boilers as being "steam boilers" why does it want to know a "Design HW Temp" and a "Loop Design DT"?  You would think that by specifying steam boilers it would lock these two items out.  I realize that it may be trying to calculate pump energy off this, but I've already negated the pump energy off my steam loop by forcing the steam loop pump power at 0 kW.  There is no pump energy on a steam heating system.  Steam is self-motive.  Except for condensate return pumps, but this energy is negligible.

3.)  One last item.  Under the airside systems, for humidifiers and preheat coils, it allows you to attach these sources to "Steam Loop".  Now, under the waterside systems you can not call a circulation loop a "Steam Loop"  you can only call it a "Hot Water Loop".  So, when you attach humidifiers/preheat coils to "Steam Loop" is eQuest smart enough to attach that load to your steam boilers?

Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated.

I'm beginning to think that the most accurate way to model this would be to create two (2) hot water systems with two boilers in each system.  One hot water system would be steam boilers for the autoclaves, humidifiers, and domestic hot water.  The other hot water system would be hot water boilers for my reheat system.  The one thing I would have to do is just make sure the heat input ratio is the same for both boiler systems.

Thanks,

mark

Hello All

I am currently trying to determine the ANNUAL heating and cooling load for each component (wall, roof, window) of the building using eQUEST.
I am able to find the peak load using report LS-B.
However as I observe report LS-E to get the annual load per component, It's difficult to determine the heating or cooling load from it as the data that is presented in that report is the summation over a month period. (Hence, you could find "heat loss" data in the "sensible cooling" row).
Is there way to derive the annual heat loss (heating) and heat gain (cooling) per building component using eQUEST?
Any information you could share is greatly appreciated.
Sincerely,

I have LSB report with sensible cooling load that has "window glass + Frm cond" with negative value while the rest of the envelope component are positive?

Hello All,

 

Long time list subscriber...first time author.

 

I'm having difficulty with a model that I have just constructed.
Unfortunately when I perform a simulation, the simulation aborts and the
program crashes when I get to roughly 18% of simulation complete...or
when it starts to Simulate HVAC Equipment.  I get completely booted out
of the file.  There is no documentation (that I can see) on what is
causing the crash.

 

There appears to be no BDL errors...and further examination of the
simulation files does not reveal any readily apparent issues.

 

I don't have much information...but any help or suggestions are
appreciated.

 

Thanks!! 

 

Tim

I had a file like that once. I cannot recall the issue with the file but

Excuse me for reviving an old thread here, but I?ve been having a similar
problem to what Taylor had in this thread and I can?t really find the
answer in the replies he received.  I have been inputting actual chiller
performance data for a project that I?m on and the results come out that
the proposed building uses much more cooling energy than the baseline.
Throughout this project I?ve thought the baseline cooling energy to be too
low, especially now when compared to a VSD centrifugal chiller which
should have better part load efficiency the baseline out performs it.

To get a concept of what a real baseline chiller should look like I asked
my local rep to produce data for a fictitious ARI chiller which matches
the COP and IPLV required by 90.1.  I then compared the EIR-f(PLR) curves
of the ARI chiller to the eQUEST default curve and found them to be
drastically different.  The eQUEST default curve starts at 1, and like
Taylor said, decreases almost linearly as the part load decreases.  The
actual data that I received shows quite the opposite, which is the chiller
starts at 1.0 at 100% and at around 70% PLR it begins to increase up until
30% where it reaches a value of 1.5.  To me this seems quite more
realistic, where the chiller (without a VSD of course) would perform much
worse at low part loads.  eQUEST defaults actually perform best at part
loads of 10% or less.

The choice of going with the default curves or with actual data of a 90.1
baseline compliant chiller has a huge impact on the energy use of my
building because 40% of my hours are in the 10-15% part load range.

Anyone have any thoughts on this subject?

The original message is attached below:

A few more comments regarding boilers:

We based the default curve for atmospheric boilers on information received
from a Northern California manufacturer?s representative. The default
atmospheric boiler consumes 45% fuel at 40% part load, so efficiency does
deteriorate. At full load, the efficiency is 80%; calculated as (PLR=1.) /
(HIR=1.25).  At 40% load, the default curve yields an efficiency of 71%;
calculated as (PLR=0.40) / (HIR=1.25 * HIRfPLR=0.45).

We believe that a 71% efficiency at 40% load is reasonable for a modern
atmospheric boiler. The default was based on a packaged water-tube boiler
with internal convective recirculation, but performance for other types is
expected to be similar.

The default atmospheric boiler unloads to 40% part-load ratio, and then
starts to cycle on/off; the HIRfPLR curve is valid only for part-load
ratios
above 40%. The loss during the off-cycle is characterized by the ?standby
time?, which is the equivalent full-load time in hours required to keep
the
boiler hot, if the boiler has no load at all. The default is 0.027 hours,
meaning that, at no load, the boiler would have to run about 2
minutes/hour
at full load to offset the jacket and flue losses. The documentation
describes the use of the standby-time vs. the part-load curve in further
detail. At very low loads, efficiency is seriously degraded; by definition
the efficiency at 0% load is 0%. You can observe this if you set up an
hourly report for the boiler and observe it at very low loads.

Our experience to date is that manufacturer?s part-load data for boiler
performance is quite difficult to obtain. If any of you have
well-documented
data that deviates significantly from the defaults, we would appreciate
hearing from you. As eQUEST/DOE-2 supports a library of equipment, it
would
be possible to add performance data for various types of boilers to the
library.


For chillers, let me further clarify Kevin's comment regarding the
EIRf(PLR,dT) curve. As Kevin explained, the dT term need be developed only
for variable-speed centrifugal chillers; it is of quite limited value for
constant-speed centrifugals, and of extremely limited value for
positive-displacement machines.

The discharge/suction temperature differential is closely associated with
the discharge/suction pressure differential. If the cooling tower is
controlled to a fixed, high setpoint such as 85F, then the chiller
impeller
may not be able to slow down much at all, even at low loads; the majority
of
capacity modulation will then be via the inlet vanes rather than speed.
This
is because the maximum possible pressure rise across the impeller drops
off
as the square of the impeller speed. Chiller impellers are typically
closely
matched to the design pressure rise specified by the engineer. If the
required pressure rise does not drop off substantially as the load drops,
then the impeller must maintain speed to avoid surge.

Data commonly published by manufacturers (and implicit in the IPLV)
ASSUMES
the condensing temperature drops with load; thereby allowing the impeller
speed to drop off. That may not actually be the case in real life! Nor is
it
true in eQUEST unless you specify a low tower setpoint, or utilize a tower
reset scheme.

The default EIRf(PLR,dT) curve for variable-speed centrifugals was
developed
using a manufacturer's proprietary software package that was loaned to us;
it password-expired after a short time. To our knowledge, these data
cannot
be developed from software available to the general engineering community.
(You need to be able to vary the chilled-water and condensing temperatures
independently of the part-load ratio. This is also why IPLV data is
worthless for an hourly simulation program; the "condenser relief" is
built
into the part-load performance.) Let me know if you are aware of any
centrifugal chiller manufacturers that make this data generally available.

This brings to mind another interesting point that perhaps others can
respond to. Over the years I have heard unsubstantiated rumors that a
multi-impeller chiller, such as a Trane, may have significantly different
part-load performance compared to a single-impeller chiller, such as a
Carrier. Does anybody have information regarding multi-impeller vs.
single-impeller part-load performance?

You are too generous Mike. I should heed my own advice on the
documentation. Thanks for clarifying this.

I also thought and consulted a colleague (thanks Steve) on Taylor's
chiller question:

For chillers, the second term in EIRf(PLR,dT) is important only for
variable-speed centrifugal chillers. It is of negligible importance in
other types of chillers. It is important in variable-speed, because the
temperature differential is strongly correlated with the required speed
of the impeller. If the dT is high enough, then the impeller may have to
run at full speed even at low loads. The DOE-2 default curves are just
that, defaults. Some folks find it necessary to create new curves to
reflect their specific equipment. Cautions offered
* verify the conditions (condenser/evaprator) for efficiencies at lower
part loads are the same as for above 50%
* make sure the points are normalized around the rating condition

Sorry for my hasty response.

My humble opinion is that you should input as much real data into eQuest as possible. Apologies to my eQuest creator friends, but default numbers are not as easily discerned as to their sources.  Obviously, great detail and care was performed in developing the "typical" buildings, but there appears to be no documentation as to where these curves, loads, etc emanate fro.
 
You cannot take an IPLV and extract four coefficients from it to develop a Base Case chiller curve (it WOULD be nice). But if ASHRAE 90.1 would give us a better guideline as to HOW to make a more accurate curve for the Base Line to create such a required IPLV.
 
So REAL (or actual) applies, as i understand it, only to the Proposed case, where one can indeed can obtain a "real" chiller curve.
 
John

Thanks for the help on Schedule types.

 

Does anyone know the best way to represent interior motorized shading?
I believe the appropriate Schedule type would be "Radiation."  However,
does anyone know the amount of radiation at which point shading would be
necessary? 

 

Thanks!

To All

 

Is there any documentation on Day Schedule types in eQuest?

 

I'm trying to set up interior motorized shading, which seems to require
an assigned schedule.  However, I do not know which schedule type should
be used to control it.  (By schedule type I mean the "Type" pull-down
menu under the Day Schedules tab-On/Off, Fraction, Multiplier, etc.

 

If there is no documentation, any experience with any of the types would
be helpful.

 

Thanks!!

My thoughts on this is that using manufacturer?s data for a chiller that
minimally complies with ASHRAE 90.1 should be just as reasonable as using
whatever program default you are using, be it eQUEST, TRANE, what have
you.



I?m really struggling to understand why eQUEST default chiller curves are
most efficient at lowest part load.

My humble opinion is that you should input as much real data into eQuest
as possible. Apologies to my eQuest creator friends, but default numbers
are not as easily discerned as to their sources.  Obviously, great detail
and care was performed in developing the "typical" buildings, but there
appears to be no documentation as to where these curves, loads, etc
emanate fro.



You cannot take an IPLV and extract four coefficients from it to develop a
Base Case chiller curve (it WOULD be nice). But if ASHRAE 90.1 would give
us a better guideline as to HOW to make a more accurate curve for the Base
Line to create such a required IPLV.



So REAL (or actual) applies, as i understand it, only to the Proposed
case, where one can indeed can obtain a "real" chiller curve.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest Default f(PLR) Skepticism

Excuse me for reviving an old thread here, but I?ve been having a similar
problem to what Taylor had in this thread and I can?t really find the
answer in the replies he received.  I have been inputting actual chiller
performance data for a project that I?m on and the results come out that
the proposed building uses much more cooling energy than the baseline.
Throughout this project I?ve thought the baseline cooling energy to be too
low, especially now when compared to a VSD centrifugal chiller which
should have better part load efficiency the baseline out performs it.

To get a concept of what a real baseline chiller should look like I asked
my local rep to produce data for a fictitious ARI chiller which matches
the COP and IPLV required by 90.1.  I then compared the EIR-f(PLR) curves
of the ARI chiller to the eQUEST default curve and found them to be
drastically different.  The eQUEST default curve starts at 1, and like
Taylor said, decreases almost linearly as the part load decreases.  The
actual data that I received shows quite the opposite, which is the chiller
starts at 1.0 at 100% and at around 70% PLR it begins to increase up until
30% where it reaches a value of 1.5.  To me this seems quite more
realistic, where the chiller (without a VSD of course) would perform much
worse at low part loads.  eQUEST defaults actually perform best at part
loads of 10% or less.

The choice of going with the default curves or with actual data of a 90.1
baseline compliant chiller has a huge impact on the energy use of my
building because 40% of my hours are in the 10-15% part load range.

Anyone have any thoughts on this subject?

The original message is attached below:

A few more comments regarding boilers:

We based the default curve for atmospheric boilers on information received
from a Northern California manufacturer?s representative. The default
atmospheric boiler consumes 45% fuel at 40% part load, so efficiency does
deteriorate. At full load, the efficiency is 80%; calculated as (PLR=1.) /
(HIR=1.25).  At 40% load, the default curve yields an efficiency of 71%;
calculated as (PLR=0.40) / (HIR=1.25 * HIRfPLR=0.45).

We believe that a 71% efficiency at 40% load is reasonable for a modern
atmospheric boiler. The default was based on a packaged water-tube boiler
with internal convective recirculation, but performance for other types is
expected to be similar.

The default atmospheric boiler unloads to 40% part-load ratio, and then
starts to cycle on/off; the HIRfPLR curve is valid only for part-load
ratios
above 40%. The loss during the off-cycle is characterized by the ?standby
time?, which is the equivalent full-load time in hours required to keep
the
boiler hot, if the boiler has no load at all. The default is 0.027 hours,
meaning that, at no load, the boiler would have to run about 2
minutes/hour
at full load to offset the jacket and flue losses. The documentation
describes the use of the standby-time vs. the part-load curve in further
detail. At very low loads, efficiency is seriously degraded; by definition
the efficiency at 0% load is 0%. You can observe this if you set up an
hourly report for the boiler and observe it at very low loads.

Our experience to date is that manufacturer?s part-load data for boiler
performance is quite difficult to obtain. If any of you have
well-documented
data that deviates significantly from the defaults, we would appreciate
hearing from you. As eQUEST/DOE-2 supports a library of equipment, it
would
be possible to add performance data for various types of boilers to the
library.


For chillers, let me further clarify Kevin's comment regarding the
EIRf(PLR,dT) curve. As Kevin explained, the dT term need be developed only
for variable-speed centrifugal chillers; it is of quite limited value for
constant-speed centrifugals, and of extremely limited value for
positive-displacement machines.

The discharge/suction temperature differential is closely associated with
the discharge/suction pressure differential. If the cooling tower is
controlled to a fixed, high setpoint such as 85F, then the chiller
impeller
may not be able to slow down much at all, even at low loads; the majority
of
capacity modulation will then be via the inlet vanes rather than speed.
This
is because the maximum possible pressure rise across the impeller drops
off
as the square of the impeller speed. Chiller impellers are typically
closely
matched to the design pressure rise specified by the engineer. If the
required pressure rise does not drop off substantially as the load drops,
then the impeller must maintain speed to avoid surge.

Data commonly published by manufacturers (and implicit in the IPLV)
ASSUMES
the condensing temperature drops with load; thereby allowing the impeller
speed to drop off. That may not actually be the case in real life! Nor is
it
true in eQUEST unless you specify a low tower setpoint, or utilize a tower
reset scheme.

The default EIRf(PLR,dT) curve for variable-speed centrifugals was
developed
using a manufacturer's proprietary software package that was loaned to us;
it password-expired after a short time. To our knowledge, these data
cannot
be developed from software available to the general engineering community.
(You need to be able to vary the chilled-water and condensing temperatures
independently of the part-load ratio. This is also why IPLV data is
worthless for an hourly simulation program; the "condenser relief" is
built
into the part-load performance.) Let me know if you are aware of any
centrifugal chiller manufacturers that make this data generally available.

This brings to mind another interesting point that perhaps others can
respond to. Over the years I have heard unsubstantiated rumors that a
multi-impeller chiller, such as a Trane, may have significantly different
part-load performance compared to a single-impeller chiller, such as a
Carrier. Does anybody have information regarding multi-impeller vs.
single-impeller part-load performance?

You are too generous Mike. I should heed my own advice on the
documentation. Thanks for clarifying this.

I also thought and consulted a colleague (thanks Steve) on Taylor's
chiller question:

For chillers, the second term in EIRf(PLR,dT) is important only for
variable-speed centrifugal chillers. It is of negligible importance in
other types of chillers. It is important in variable-speed, because the
temperature differential is strongly correlated with the required speed
of the impeller. If the dT is high enough, then the impeller may have to
run at full speed even at low loads. The DOE-2 default curves are just
that, defaults. Some folks find it necessary to create new curves to
reflect their specific equipment. Cautions offered
* verify the conditions (condenser/evaprator) for efficiencies at lower
part loads are the same as for above 50%
* make sure the points are normalized around the rating condition

Sorry for my hasty response.

I am sure we would welcome typical chiller data that
minimally complys.Remember that IPLV allows condenser
water relief for their calculations. eQuest needs
three curves including the kW/ton at CONSTANT
condenser water - then the program will "jump a curve"
to move the kW/ton to its location based on outdoor
air AND point on the part load curve.

Not always consistant, part load vs. outdoor air. I
believe Steve Gates has a comment on that in the
BLDG-SIM archives.

It depends on what product you're trying to represent or, if custom to 
the job, what your control specifications are.  Automated shades can be 
triggered based on depth of sun penetration, interior illuminance, 
discomfort glare, lack of urban shadows, etc (see example specifications 
for a fairly sophisticated automated roller shade system at:
http://windows.lbl.gov/comm_perf/pdf/NYT_RShades-Spec12-31-04.pdf

Assuming that eQuest's interior shade models do not deviate from DOE-2's 
algorithms, the interior shade model is fairly simplistic: it is either 
fully up or fully down depending on trigger values for transmitted solar 
radiation, discomfort glare, etc.  Historically, we've used 30 Btu/h-ft2 
for transmitted direct (beam) solar radiation.  Best to run parametrics 
to better understand impacts of trigger values on PPD and discomfort 
glare.  See DOE-2 reference manual 2.1E Loads documentation on window 
shading management.

Okay, I think I understand now.  The EIR fPLR curve is not actually a
correction to the EIR efficiency, but to the total power draw of the
chiller.  I was calculating EIRFPLR as EIR(current conditions)/ EIR
(design conditions), when eQUEST wants it in the format of a power draw at
current conditions divided by the power draw at design conditions.

This also clears up another question I had which was why eQUEST calculates
the total power draw as a function of full load operating capacity and not
the actual load.  The EIRFPLR curve corrects it.

After fixing my equation the EIRFPLR values I received from the
manufacturer are within 2-7% of eQUEST default curves.

Thanks all for your help!

I am sure we would welcome typical chiller data that
minimally complys.Remember that IPLV allows condenser
water relief for their calculations. eQuest needs
three curves including the kW/ton at CONSTANT
condenser water - then the program will "jump a curve"
to move the kW/ton to its location based on outdoor
air AND point on the part load curve.

Not always consistant, part load vs. outdoor air. I
believe Steve Gates has a comment on that in the
BLDG-SIM archives.

Virdi,

I suspect that solar gains have something to do with your peak cooling
occurring in December, assuming that the internal loads are pretty
consistent throughout the year. Perhaps there is a shading device that
allows sunshine to enter through the window in December and not the rest
of the year.

The negative cooling load means that some of the heat within the room is
being conducted through the window to the outside. It makes sense in
your case since the outside temperature is cooler than the inside
temperature. Since some of the heat is escaping to the outside through
the window, less heat has to be removed through the HVAC system.

We have to wonder why heat is not also being conducted through the wall
and roof (if any). This is probably a very transient situation,
especially if the sun is the culprit. Perhaps the thermal mass of the
wall and roof prevents it from responding as quickly as the window.


Sincerely,

Hello All,
1. What is the theory behind negative cooling load in LS-B report?
I have LSB report with sensible cooling load that has "window glass +
Frm cond" with negative value while the rest of the envelope component
are positive?
2. And why eQUESt selects Dec 3 data that has 68 F dry bulb temperature
to calculate peak cooling load while the zone temperature is set at 82F?
Thank you for any response that can be shared.

Hello All

I am currently trying to determine the ANNUAL heating and cooling load
for each component (wall, roof, window) of the building using eQUEST.
I am able to find the peak load using report LS-B.
However as I observe report LS-E to get the annual load per component,
It's difficult to determine the heating or cooling load from it as the
data that is presented in that report is the summation over a month
period. (Hence, you could find "heat loss" data in the "sensible
cooling" row).
Is there way to derive the annual heat loss (heating) and heat gain
(cooling) per building component using eQUEST?
Any information you could share is greatly appreciated.

Matthew,

First, a warning: This may spark a debate about what R-value *really* is and how it's calculated (ie, the thermodynamic definition versus a contractor's definition). This is just my understanding of it. If anyone else can explain it better, please do so.

Anyhow, it sounds like you're wondering what the "real-world" R-value of your model's envelope is. As far as I know, with these numbers you can calculate only the conductive resistance simply by dividing the thickness by the conductivity (and, technically, also by 1 sqft though it has no effect on the numerical result, just the units). That is, Rcond=L/(kA), where L=thickness, k=conductivity, and A=area. This is the definition of conductive thermal resistance found in any thermodynamics textbook. However, manufacture-rated R-values are calculated by a test according to ASTM, which includes radiant and convective effects and a certain temperature gradient (conductivity itself actually varies with temperature), so 'real' values would be a bit different.

U-value and R-values are inverses of each other: U=1/R and R=1/U. 

Theoretically you can combine the conductive resistance with "resistances" for radiation and convection, if you assume certain surface temperatures, emissitivities, windspeeds, and all that fun stuff (such as what I'm guessing the ASTM test specifies). Then, the total R-value is simply the sum of all these. I think building simulation tools often assume a certain "windspeed", etc, and factor in the additional heat loss accordingly.

I hope that helps, and is mostly right...

 Matthew & All,

I did a bit of research on the ASTM tests...seems I was wrong about them including radiant and convective effects, they seem to be purely conduction tests. Check out http://www.sprayfoam.org/R-values%20of%20SPF.pdf for a description of some of the testing procedures.

Message-ID: <5910A0754536EA4AAD411AE8221C396203FBB71F@nrccenexb1.nrc.ca>

Dear All,
 
I've recently coded the equations in ASHRAE 55 (2004) for calculating PMV and PPD and cross referenced these to ISO 7730:2005 (the reference ASHRAE gives).  There are several differences:
1) line 250 - ASHRAE has an extra factor of 6.45 in the equation
2) line 300 - ISO has (TRA/100)*4, ASHRAE (TRA/100)**4
3) line 480 - ISO has (TRA/100**4), ASHRAE has (TRA/100)**4
4) line 520 - ISO does not define a value for HL6 (ASHRAE has this on line 490)
 
I believe that difference (1) is unimportant as its setting the initial guess for an iterative loop.  However, for the other three differences I believe that ASHRAE is correct and ISO has typos.
 
I also have differences in the output from the example cases.  The differences are:
1) ASHRAE cases 3 and 6 give 11% PPD (the standard has 10%)
2) ISO case 7 gives 8% PPD (the standard has 10%)
 
The ASHRAE cases do not concern me too much as the PMV is the same to one decimal place, but the PMV in the ISO standard is quite different (0.50 in the std, 0.36 by my calculations).
 
Does anyone:
1) disagree with my conclusions as to the differences in the printed code (i.e. you do not think ISO has typos)?
2) have any insights as to the numerical differences (I think that there may be a typo in the ISO standard)?
 
Thanks,
 
Iain

Umit,
It may be that you are using an older version of eQUEST to open a PD2 file
that was created using a newer version of eQUEST. Check the version of
eQUEST used to create the PD2 file by opening the PD2 file using any text
editor (e.g., right click on the PD2 file, select "open with" & use
Notepad). The version number will be noted on the second line of the PD2
file. Use a version of eQUEST that is at least as current to open the
project.

but the "wizard data Edit" was inaktiv, I cant open the building creation
wizard.

I am going to attach the error, anybody has an experience with this error?

have a sunny day

Marlin,
we installed new version of e-quest but now under Mode "wizard data edit"
is inactive thats why we can not change building data. Do you have any
idea what can be the problem here?

The symptoms you describe sound like you may have used eQUEST to open the
project using only the INP file rather than the PD2 file. Normally, you will
have both a PD2 file (contains wizard inputs) and an INP file (a DOE-2.2
file which is what's viewed and edited in eQUEST's Detailed Interface). 

To launch eQUEST, I normally double click on the project PD2 file. As a side
note, if you have multiple versions of eQUEST installed, double clicking on
the PD2 file will only launch the last version of eQUEST that ran on your
machine. If you have multiple versions of eQUEST installed on your machine,
be sure to launch the preferred version, e.g., from the Start-> All Programs
menu or a desktop shortcut, etc., then open the preferred PD2 file. 

If the only eQUEST project file available is an INP file, this can also be
opened using eQUEST by first launching eQUEST and then from within eQUEST
(via file open) browsing to the INP file. As eQUEST opens the INP file in
this manner, eQUEST will expect to find a PD2 file by the same name as the
INP file in the same folder. If it does not find a PD2 file by the same name
as the INP just opened, the user is prompted to identify some minimum
information, e.g., preferred weather file among other things, which
information is used to create a new PD2 file. A PD2 file created in this
manner will be almost entirely empty, containing no wizard inputs describing
the original project used to create the INP file opened in the first place.
In this situation, the only mode made available is the detailed edit mode. 

If you want access to the wizard inputs from your project, you must open the
PD2 used to define the building in the first place. Another side note, if
all you have is a PD2 file (e.g., INP file missing), when you first launch
eQUEST using the PD2 file, eQUEST will look to find an INP file by the same
name, in the same folder. Not finding an INP file with a matching name, the
project will open into the Detailed Interface (eQUEST always opens an
exiting project into the Detailed Interface, never directly into any of the
Wizards) with no project info at all, i.e., all screens in the Detailed
Interface will initially appear blank. In this case, you must go (back) into
the wizard and hit the 'Finish' button to regenerate an INP file which will
then be displayed upon return to the Detailed Interface.

Hi all,
I'm looking for some weather data for Rwanda.  I haven't been able to find a
complete year of any kind of hourly data for any city in the country, so any
direction would be helpful.  The best I've found so far is some sporadic
hours of recorded temperatures from NASA for a couple of cities.

Thanks for any help,
Aleka

Two questions:

 

1)       Is there a way to change the default values in eQuest, many of
which are currently Title 24? If yes, how?

2)       For default values which are different for non-California
locations, is there a repository of building code minimum values by state
for Equest?

Christian-

To change a default value within the eQuest program you can right mouse
click on the value and chose "Edit/View User Default".  Then you can input
your own value and all "defaulted-out" values will use this instead.  It
will show up in blue instead of the usual green.

Thank you for detailed answer, I do not open the project by using INP file
even if I am a beginner :). I found out the Problem I tried all versions
from 3-61 to 3-61e (http://www.doe2.com/download/eQUEST/) and could open
it with 3.61e without problem.

Dear all,

I created windows and walls in "Detailed Data Edit" component Tree and
changed the mode to "Wizard Data Edit" in order to check some inputs in
building creation wizard. But the windows and walls that I defined were
missing even in "Detailed Data Edit" Why? Why the change between Modes
causes information lost?

My understanding is that is a function of the program:
Changes made in DD are not transfered back to Wizard Mode.  I think it is in 
the Tutorial.

I experienced the same thing on an HVAC system, I added a humidifier in DD 
mode and it was lost in Wizard.

Check the tutorial.  It states this fact, but not sure why

Peter
yes you are right, it means firstly we should complete the inputs in
Wizard then start to work in DD. Maybe software developers can find a
solution for this because it would be very usefull to change the mode
without losing the informations.

The reason that changes in detailed edit mode are lost when you switch to
wizard edit mode and back is that when you click "Finish" in the wizard
mode, the program overwrites the BDL file, and thus overwrites your changes.

On strategy I use to check my inputs in wizard mode after I have made
changes in detail mode is to:

1. save the file
2. switch to wizard edit mode
3. open the wizard mode
4. check my inputs
5. VERY IMPORTANT--instead of clicking "finish" to return to detailed edit
mode, simply click the close box in the upper right hand corner.  This way
you can return to detailed edit mode without overwriting the BDL file.  This
also means that any changes made in the wizard mode will not propagate to
the detailed mode, but it does allow you to recheck your inputs.

hope this helps.

Message-ID: <69a9bc0a0802070757x25e912ddn322de3974971e992@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have just created a trial project using natural ventilation in eQuest.  I
have 5% openable area to the net floor area. I multiplied by 0.6 (for total
vent area fraction) I end up with 0.3 for my total vent area fraction.

When compared to a system using the "air-change" method for natural
ventilation, the heating energy is approximately equal when "0.18" air
changes is specified.  However, the cooling energy increases by a factor of
6.  Also, this 0.18 air changes per hour is only 65% of what would be
required if 62.1 were used.

Has anyone used the S-G method for natural ventilation successfully?  Any
thoughts on the above observations?

Thanks,

Karen

Asif,

For a building with floors of varying footprints, I generally use the DD
wizard in eQUEST to create different shells. One shell per multiple floors
with the same footprint.

Message-ID: <5001859a0802071137m750411d2xd7e36fb1bdc87bd7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

We are working on an eQUEST simulation for a meseum. Three systems have
humidifiers in the air handlers and side stream dehumidifiers. The
humidifiers add moistures by blowing compressed air with water into the
supply air stream, instead of directly injecting water steam. One of the
three dehumidifiers uses gas and the other two use electricity. The relative
humidity (RH) has to be controlled within 20% to 30%. However, couple
problems came out.

1. There is no compressed-air type humidifier in eQUEST.

2. The humidifiers we specified (any humidifier type available in eQUEST)
did not seem to work because for two systems, the RH falls below the
controlled range for most of the hours.

3. On dehumidification side, we used "add-on desiccant" tab to plug in the
dehumidifier. But the "SOL-VENT-AIR-1" type dehumidifier type did not work
at all no matter how we played with the input parameters, including the air
flow rate through the desiccant unit as a fraction of the design supply air
flow rate of the system, the outside air ratio, and so forth.

4. After we changed the desiccant system type to "LIQ-VENT-AIR-1" for all
three systems, the humidity control worked for one system, but another one
still have RH higher than the specified maximum RH value in a lot of hours.


Anyone knows why humidity control did not seem to work in this project? Any
thought is appreciated!

Thanks.

Shawn

Hello Colleagues,

eQuest cannot obviously directly handle desuperheaters.
Do you have a methodology that would allow me to model the operation of

Message-ID: <21B0B92BAE9B75458CA9781211D53303019ECD08@CD1001-M200.corp.ads>

All,
 
The NRC document Performance Compliance for Buildings, states that if the fenestration to wall ratio is greater than 0.4 to use the following formula:
 
Ar = Ap + (1-(0.4/FWR))*Awind
 
Ar = Reference opaque area
Ap = Proposed opaque area
FWR = Fenestration to wall ratio
Awind = Area of windows in proposed design
 
I assumed that the intent was to increase the reference case wall area so that the FWR equals 0.4.  But this calculation does not do that.  I calculated for a proposed design with a FWR of 0.46 and the resulting reference FWR is 0.43???
 
The EE4-CBIP modeling documentation states that the window to wall ratio shall be for the reference case 0.4 and if the proposed case is greater than 0.4 than you must increase the wall area so that the wwr does equal 0.4
 
Any suggestions on what to do?  Does anyone have any experience with the NRC document and why there is a disconnect between the intent of the calc and the results?
 
Thanks.
 
Tim.

Check sentence 2) of section 5.3.5.5 Windows -- it defines the reference 
building window size by setting the reference  FWR as the lesser of the 
proposed building FWR or 0.4.  This defines the reference building 
window area.

The sentence you are quoting increases the reference building wall 
area.  Given that your FWR is 0.46, this formula calculates the wall 
area to give the reference building the 0.4 FWR.  It worked for me (see 
attached spreadsheet).  If your Ap = 540 and your Awind = 460, FWR = 
0.46,t solves for Ar = 600 giving a reference FWR of 0.4.

Cheers,
Brian

Message-ID: <47ac5448.0437560a.0ef1.ffff975a@mx.google.com>

Hello ? I am a new DOE2.2 user and I am working with a group of engineers
based in Europe.  I have 2 questions which I cannot resolve from the
documentation.

 

[1]  How do I set up the project so I can work with metric units (SI)?  The
eQUEST interface suggests this should be possible since the pull down menu
in ?units of measurement? include an option for metric (as shown in the
screenshot).  

 

[2] Where can I find the compliance rule processor?  I need to incorporate
the different European energy code compliance rules, but I cannot find
instructions in the document ?DOE22Vol5-ComplianceAnalysis.pdf?.  Also, I
cannot find the program D2RulCmp.exe.

 

 

I appreciate in advance any guidance on this.

 

Kind regards

 

Xavier Barrera

eQUEST does not currently support SI units -- that teasing box is there 
for future capabilities but it is not currently active.

For the compliance editor and a sample ruleset etc., you would need to 
talk to the eQUEST development team (Jeff, Scott et al).

Hi everyone,

This might seem trivial. But I just want to find out if any of you notice that
the title in the Parametric Run Reports differ from the file name,
particularly if you save the same file under different name and run the
simulation.

For e.g., a file was originally saved as "XYZ 2007-12-23" and then re-saved as
"XYZ 2008-01-12" with some other changes and run. The parametric run report
for the re-saved file remains unchanged as the original one, ALTHOUGH the
results of the new simulation reflect the changes.

Varkie,
 
Table G-M of the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 User's Manual (note this is a
different document than the standard itself) provides occupancy,
lighting, HVAC, Domestic Hot Water, and Elevator schedules for school
buildings. I use these schedules all the time, especially since it is
the only place I have seen an elevator schedule. The table includes this
note:
Schedules for occupancy, lighting, receptacle, HVAC system, and service
hot water are from ASHRAE Standard 90.1-1989 and addendums, except that
5% emergency lighting has been added for all off hours. Elevator
schedules, except for restaurants, are from the U.S. Department of
Energy Standard Evaluation Techniques except changed to 0% when
occupancy is 0%. These values may be used only if actual schedules are
not known.

Also, ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G lets you take advantage of both
improving the efficiency of the water heating equipment and reducing the
hot water demand (I think this was in one of the addenda). To be honest,
usually I just use the default domestic hot water demand schedules and
capacities within eQUEST for the building type I am modeling, and then
apply the hot water heater efficiency to that.

Hope this helps,

Nathan Miller

Hello everyone,
 
I'm going through the all the addenda to 90.1-2004, looking at what
changes could affect a LEED model. As far as I can tell, Addendum A
mentions changes to numerous sections that don't seem to be in the
original Appendix G! There are revisions to "Section G3.8 Lighting",
"Section G4.3 Baseline Service Hot Water Systems," "G4.5 Other Baseline
Systems," and others, but Appendix G stops at Section G3.1.3.15 and
Table G3.2. I checked my copy of 90.1-2004 against the free preview on
the ASHRAE website, it's the same. Were these sections added elsewhere?
(Or, much more likely, am I going crazy?) I'm only on the first Addenda
and already this looks like a bad idea...

Hi Everyone,

I am trying to model a displacement ventilation system in a large 30 ft
high space. I have broken up the space into three stacked zones. The
displacement ventilation system is set up to condition the occupied zone
only (bottom 10 ft) with the return located at the top of the space. The
stack effect takes care of the top 20ft.

I wondering if this could be considered as a special strategy and the
base case under chapter 11 should be modelled as a simple system as per
the budget system descriptions. Chapter 11 does not specifically talk
about the displacement ventilation system but the zoning break up
however is required to be the same in the design case and the ECB. Does
any one have any experience with such a situation? Please help.

Thanks

You're not crazy.  The numerical references in the addendums are not all correct.  In general, if you go by the title of the section referred to you should be able to decifer what they are referring to.

I am simulating a twin towers site.  I have created the east and west towers in different files through the 'Schematic Design Wizard'.

How can I combine these two files into one?

Message-ID: <1901717528DF6E4EA2EEB294C11E78503BB1D3@MULTIORG1.cgnetmo.org>

I am having some difficulties regarding ventilation in VAV systems for a
LEED energy model that some of you have probably encountered and would
like your ideas regarding how to handle them. I am using Trane TRACE
v.6.1.2.

 

1. ASHRAE 62.1-2004 requires some ventilation in storage rooms - 0
cfm/person (because it is typically unoccupied) and 0.12 cfm/sq ft
(Table 6-1). I have a school with some internal storage rooms (no
envelope exposure). The only internal load is lighting. Even if I have
the lights on, the supply air needed is less than 0.12 cfm/sq ft, so the
ventilation fraction for the room is greater than one. The multiple
space equation then causes the entire VAV system to need 100% outside
air. Then the baseline model would need energy recovery...You see how
far from reality this is going?

 

One idea I had to deal with it is to manually override the supply air to
some quantity above 0.12 cfm/sq ft instead of using the calculated
supply air flow, but I have a feeling that the LEED evaluator would not
look favorably on that. Perhaps it would be acceptable as long as I did
it the same in both the baseline and the proposed building. What
suggestions do you have for dealing with this?

 

2. ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G requires that the minimum volume
setpoints for VAV reheat boxes to be 0.4 cfm/sq ft for the baseline
(G3.1.3.13). This also causes the same problem as above - 100% outside
air for the system. Of course the minimum volume setpoints for the
proposed model would match the design, so it is only a problem for the
baseline. The critical rooms are not only storage rooms mentioned above,
but other spaces where the ventilation requirement exceeds the load
demand, such as restrooms. I have transfer air set up for each of these
spaces. Is there some trick with using transfer air to make it work out?


 

There were no interpretations for 90.1 that addressed this. The only
related CIR I found from the USGBC was dated 2-2-07 with a ruling on
2-26-07 for a lab which states in part, "Alternately, the project may
opt to model the VAV system as energy neutral and use the design minimum
turn down ratios of the proposed design." I take this to mean that I
could have the minimum settings in the baseline match the proposed, but
I would have to change the envelope and lighting for each room in the
system to match the baseline to make the system "energy neutral." We
would loose credit for the lighting savings. There were other CIRs that
stated that the 0.4 cfm/sq ft minimum setting could be disregarded in
spaces where pressures needed to be maintained (laboratories, hospitals,
etc.) Any suggestions?

Keith,

 

For situation (1), exception (5) to 90.1-04 section 6.5.2.1 should
provide relief.

 

The User's Manual explains the details and gives an example that
illuminates this.

 

I believe this is the rationale: moving to 100% OA system would greatly
increase the energy usage of the project while over-ventilating many
zones. Therefore, increasing the supply air to selected critical zones
can be balanced against increasing the total ventilation air in order to
produce an optimized design somewhere between Constant Volume Reheat and
100% OA VAV.

 

For situation (2), ASHRAE 90.1 baselines may not produce a design that
complies with the ventilation code. The minimum ventilation airflow for
the baseline will be identical to the proposed case (G3.1.2.5), but as
you noted the VAV minimums may be different. I imagine this would
penalize a VAV system where larger "proposed case" minimums are required
for 62 compliance.

 

This may be an area where an addendum could allow some wiggle room
similar to exception (5) to section 6.5.2.1.

 

Aaron

I agree with your idea to manually override the supply air quantities
for some spaces to make the OSA ratio for your system be less than one.
We have done this on a LEED project and believe it is acceptable as long
as your supply air quantities (and system sizes) are the same for your
baseline and proposed.  Good luck!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Ventilation Problems in VAV Systems for LEED Model



I am having some difficulties regarding ventilation in VAV systems for a
LEED energy model that some of you have probably encountered and would
like your ideas regarding how to handle them. I am using Trane TRACE
v.6.1.2.

 

1. ASHRAE 62.1-2004 requires some ventilation in storage rooms - 0
cfm/person (because it is typically unoccupied) and 0.12 cfm/sq ft
(Table 6-1). I have a school with some internal storage rooms (no
envelope exposure). The only internal load is lighting. Even if I have
the lights on, the supply air needed is less than 0.12 cfm/sq ft, so the
ventilation fraction for the room is greater than one. The multiple
space equation then causes the entire VAV system to need 100% outside
air. Then the baseline model would need energy recovery...You see how
far from reality this is going?

 

One idea I had to deal with it is to manually override the supply air to
some quantity above 0.12 cfm/sq ft instead of using the calculated
supply air flow, but I have a feeling that the LEED evaluator would not
look favorably on that. Perhaps it would be acceptable as long as I did
it the same in both the baseline and the proposed building. What
suggestions do you have for dealing with this?

 

2. ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G requires that the minimum volume
setpoints for VAV reheat boxes to be 0.4 cfm/sq ft for the baseline
(G3.1.3.13). This also causes the same problem as above - 100% outside
air for the system. Of course the minimum volume setpoints for the
proposed model would match the design, so it is only a problem for the
baseline. The critical rooms are not only storage rooms mentioned above,
but other spaces where the ventilation requirement exceeds the load
demand, such as restrooms. I have transfer air set up for each of these
spaces. Is there some trick with using transfer air to make it work out?


 

There were no interpretations for 90.1 that addressed this. The only
related CIR I found from the USGBC was dated 2-2-07 with a ruling on
2-26-07 for a lab which states in part, "Alternately, the project may
opt to model the VAV system as energy neutral and use the design minimum
turn down ratios of the proposed design." I take this to mean that I
could have the minimum settings in the baseline match the proposed, but
I would have to change the envelope and lighting for each room in the
system to match the baseline to make the system "energy neutral." We
would loose credit for the lighting savings. There were other CIRs that
stated that the 0.4 cfm/sq ft minimum setting could be disregarded in
spaces where pressures needed to be maintained (laboratories, hospitals,
etc.) Any suggestions?

Ross:

I am sure that approach can be done. However, I have always found it
easier to do both towers in the Design Development Wizard. You can
switch from the Schematic to the DD Wizard in the menus.

You can then base your 2nd tower shell to copy the same level shell in
Tower 1. Then go to the first screen, in which you can say how many feet
and in which direction you wish this shell to be from the reference
shell.

Hi,

I am simulating a twin towers site.  I have created the east and west

How can I combine these two files into one?

I was hoping somebody could either answer this question for me, or

Appendix G was reformatted for the version that was published in 90.1, 2004. The changes in Addendum A were made to the Appendix G before it was reformatted, but not soon enough to get into 2004 version. Very confusing, I know.

Hello everyone,

I'm going through the all the addenda to 90.1-2004, looking at what changes could affect a LEED model. As far as I can tell, Addendum A mentions changes to numerous sections that don't seem to be in the original Appendix G! There are revisions to "Section G3.8 Lighting", "Section G4.3 Baseline Service Hot Water Systems," "G4.5 Other Baseline Systems," and others, but Appendix G stops at Section G3.1.3.15 and Table G3.2. I checked my copy of 90.1-2004 against the free preview on the ASHRAE website, it's the same. Were these sections added elsewhere? (Or, much more likely, am I going crazy?) I'm only on the first Addenda and already this looks like a bad idea...

Further to this, I am also working on a twin-tower type project, however 
the two buildings (with complicated floor plates) are mirror images of 
each other.

Can anyone come up with an easier way of creating the 2nd tower based on 
the 1st in eQUEST (currently at DD wizard stage)? I know that eQUEST 
creates mirror image polygons for the floors (ceilings?) but I can't 
think of a creative way of using them. As far as I know there is no "use 
mirror image" button in the DD interface (although in this case I would 
be happy to be wrong!).

Any thoughts, hints or suggestions?

Regarding Ross's query, I agree with John that switching to DD wizard 
would be the best solution as you can then copy most of the inputs from 
the 1st tower as a 2nd shell. If you had already progressed far in to 
the detailed edit, you could import the 2nd building .inp file. As 
Scott/Marlin pointed out recently, doing this will give you the detailed 
edit keywords but not the wizard ones so you would never be able to go 
back to the wizard.

Thanks

Brian-

In the DD wizard you can create a copy of the shell(s) you just created for
the first tower.  Then you would just need to change the placement of them
to match the coordinates of the site.

Hello All,
 
While I see the Parent, Grandparent, Great-Grandparent, Global, Local,
and Local-Reference functions defined in BDL for retrieving the value of
keywords from their respective objects, I don't see a 'general object'
function.  
 
Say I want to define the third floor's Z coordinate as "the second
floor's Z coordinate plus 12.5".  Perhaps I am I missing something, but
as the second floor is a sibling of the first floor, it seems to me none
of the object access functions listed above will work. 
 
Do I need to define a parameter? Any insights appreciated...  
 
 
PS: Do the DOE2.1E BDL extensions (a reference mentioned on Visual DOE
website) apply to eQuest 3.6x?
 
Thanks

Mike - Like Robby, I have a mix-mode building and am trying to determine
how to document the savings for LEED-NC credit EA1.  The only CIR I can
find on the USGBC website that has to do with natural ventilation energy
savings is from 3/22/2007, is this the CIR you were referring to?  

The project team in that CIR was proposing to use EnergyPlus, which I
hear is a better natural ventilation simulation engine.  Has anyone out
there had success using eQuest (DOE2.2) for a LEED energy submittal
taking credit for natural ventilation?  I realize it would most likely
require some work using the Exceptional Calculation Method as per the
backup option proposed in the CIR I referenced, but I believe there
would have to be a simulation done at some point.   I'm just wondering
if I'm wasting my time to try and do this portion of the documentation
with eQuest (I hope not since my model is started in eQuest already and
I don't have any experience with EnergyPlus) or if eQuest has been
accepted as an adequate tool for natural ventilation simulation by the
USGBC.

 

I have a copy of the CIBSE publication you mentioned and am working my
way through it to provide the best documentation possible.  I am only
assuming at this point that an hourly simulation is required, but I
don't see any other way, even with the use of the equations found in
chapter 4 of the CIBSE book.

 

Any help or ideas are much appreciated.

 

Thank You,

Robby,

 

If your project is seeking LEED certification and you want to claim
credit for the Natural Ventilation under EA-1, I reccomend that you get
the book "Natural ventilation in non-domestic buildings" published by
the CIBSE and the Carbon Trust.  USGBC requires a rigourous analysis of
your natural ventilation modeling results before granting any EA-1
credit and this reference will help you navigate that.  You should also
read the CIR regarding natural ventilation energy savings on the USGBC
website.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Mixed Mode Ventilation in eQUEST

Hi all,

 

I'm working on an energy model for a project that is very interested in
incorporating a mixed mode ventilation scheme.  The mixed mode would
operate in an on/off red light green light method where the mechanical
cooling would shut down during hours when the outdoor air temperature
could meet the space cooling loads and the mechanical system would run
its relief fan in order to pull air into the space.  It would be up to
the occupants to open the operable windows.  

 

I've been through the basic options for natural ventilation in eQUEST
and it doesn't look like what's available in eQUEST is going to work for
the PIU system I have in the building right now. I'm thinking it will
have to involve some sort of schedule modification to turn off the
perimeter VAV box fans during hours when the loads could be met by the
natural ventilation.  I could make the schedule based on BIN calc
information for Seattle.  This would involve a lot of fine tuning though
and it would be questionable whether I could still keep the unmet load
hours under 300.  To simulate the operable windows modifications could
be made to the infiltration values at the perimeter spaces.

 

If anyone has had any success with mixed mode ventilation or has any
ideas towards this it would be much appreciated.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] EnergyPlus Node Structure/Diagram
Message-ID: <000001c86d64$cdb5cca0$cdb9687a@user>

Hi everyone, 
 
I use Design Builder as an interface to run EnergyPlus. Design Builder
uses Compact HVAC to model HVAC system. EnergyPlus takes input data from
Design Builder, expands Compact HVAC into an EPlus idf file and runs the
simulation. I observed that conversion of Compact HVAC into an Eplus
HVAC system is far from being perfect.
 
I would like to modify the Eplus idf input file to reflect the actual
HVAC system. I am experiencing problem in developing node details for
the six HVAC loops. I have gone through the input/output reference
manual of Eplus. I understand the concept of loop, node & node diagram
but find it hard to develop an actual node diagram & input relevant data
into an idf file.
 
Could you please suggest is there any example or literature that
demonstrates practically development of node structure and input file
for all the six loops?  
 
I would appreciate your help & suggestion.
 
 
Thanks

Dear All

I converted EnergyPlus (epw) Weather data into .Bin data by using
"eQ_WthProc"  weather data converted succesfully but in the LS-L
Management and solar summary all radiation values are zero. I tried same
thing with other cities for example Kuwait, Seattle and Stuttgart it works
with those cities but not Dubai, although I check the "Calculate Solar
Direct-Normal based on Global Horizontal" box on the EPW Weather files
conversion Tab.

does anyone experienced such thing before, or does anyone has Dubai .Bin
weather data.

Dear Fred,
I had the simlar problem with Energplus .epw Weather data in order to
convert it into the .Bin data. I converted it but the problem was
radiation data. in the input file the direct radiation data was not
complete. But in DOE data I dont have problem till now.

Tejes,
 
The I/O Reference can be helpful, but sometimes it's even more helpful to look at the example files (in a folder called "Example Files" that comes w/the EP installation).  You could write the EnergyPlus Yahoo! group, also.  It sounds like you've already looked at the .expidf file, right?  If you haven't, that's the file that contains the objects created by the Compact HVAC object, in all their expanded, noded, looped, branched glory.  It's created automatically when you simulate your .idf file.  I couldn't tell from your email if the problem you were having with Compact HVAC was related to Design Builder or not.  Good luck!

I can't overstate the usefulness of drawing yourself a big diagram of your
HVAC loops, with your nodes and each component labeled.  This is an area
that would benefit so much from a quality graphical user interface.  When
working in idf, you really need to draw your HVAC diagram to have a prayer
of success with a complicated system.  Debugging hvac loops in EnergyPlus is
really hard to do.

Hello All-

 

I'm filling out the template for LEED EA credit 1 and I need to know
where to find the total number of hours during which cooling and heating
loads are unmet.  I know in the detailed simulation output BEPS, the
following is given:

 

PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE =  0.6

PERCENT OF HOURS ANY PLANT LOAD NOT SATISFIED                =  0.0

 

How do I convert that to a number of hours instead of a percent?

 

I also noted that the SS-F report gives undercooled and underheated
hours for each of my zones... Can I avoid going through each of my zones
and adding up the hours? (I have many zones)

 

Thanks!!

I have a metal building wall construction with R-19 insulation between

Now in ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix A, Table A3.2 the single layer of
mineral fiber only goes up to R-13.
 
Any suggestion on how to determine the U-Factor for this wall?

Linda,
Select the eQUEST summary tab view (next to spreadsheet tab) while in
the Air-Side HVAC module. You'll see the hours unmet for both heating
and cooling summarized there for each AHU.

Report SS-R will tell you total yearly under heated and undercooled hours
for each zone (organized by system).  I believe that what is needed for EA 1
documentation is the MAXIMUM unmet heating and cooling load hours for the
least satisfied zone.  You may also wan to look at SS-O to make sure that
none of the underheated or undercooled hours are too far out of range.

In equest, the summary tab under air-side.  This should have total hours
separated into cooling and heating.

Linda,

 

The percentage in the BEPS Report refers to 8760 hours. 

So for example 0.6% gives 52 hours.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest Loads unmet

 

Hello All-

 

I'm filling out the template for LEED EA credit 1 and I need to know
where to find the total number of hours during which cooling and heating
loads are unmet.  I know in the detailed simulation output BEPS, the
following is given:

 

PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE =  0.6

PERCENT OF HOURS ANY PLANT LOAD NOT SATISFIED                =  0.0

 

How do I convert that to a number of hours instead of a percent?

 

I also noted that the SS-F report gives undercooled and underheated
hours for each of my zones... Can I avoid going through each of my zones
and adding up the hours? (I have many zones)

 

Thanks!!

CO is not like CO2, it is deadly. Garage ventilation requirements (0.75
cfm/sf) are based on fresh air change to reduce contaminant levels to
acceptable values. Besides, CO is not the only thing in auto exhaust, there
is NOx, SOx, etc. so you would have to "sense" all these and what if a
sensor fails and the fans do not energize? Seems too dangerous and risky to
me. Efficiency cannot trump life safety. Best to use open walls on two sides
and natural ventilation can replace 100% of the power exhaust requirements,
assuming the structure is above ground that is.

Hi, I'm wondering if 90.1 makes any stipulations regarding building air
infiltration, for example can there be a difference between proposed
design and energy budget building?  I can't seem to find any reference

wade though.  Is there a more easily digested summary available

Does anyone know if USGBC is allowing credit for CO Control of parking garage ventilation?  If anyone has any experience with successfully getting credit for this efficiency measure can you please let me know.  I am curious what is considered a reasonable baseline.
 
Dear Colleagues;

Short answer: I sure hope not!
 
I very much believe the "reasonable" baseline is CO sensors, so you would schedule the airflows (thus power, if all goes correctly in model land) proportional to some assumed activity schedule. (There is a good summary of what those flows might be in an ASHRAE Jrnl that's about ten years old but on the AJ website.)  CO control is pretty much SOP; I think the IMC, or one of the codes around here, went up to 1.25 cfm/sf constant venting unless CO sensors are used; pretty much assuring everyone uses sensors. There may still be a code req'd floor on the min vent rate even w/sensors. And, in all but the smallest garages, staged fans are typical. MAYBE someone could invent some rationale that if there were some long ducts serving a deep garage, then VSD fans might have a SLIGHTLY lower operating W/cfm and closer tracking of actual req'd dilution air. But not by much.
 
Sure it sounds like "DCV" and the PRM sez we can take credit for that; but we would be creating a baseline considerably worse than typical construction, even 5-10 year old construction. And certainly we can't use 0.7 W/cfm in this baseline. This is why when we get proposals from savvy clients, they specify bldg maximum Btu/sf or kWh/sf or emissions/sf; not some "savings" vs. an artificial baseline. 
 
Fred
 
P.S. Today's Puzzler: What ASHRAE PRM category does a heated parking garage fall into? Does it matter if the heating capacity is more than the semi-conditioned space Btuh/sf rate?

Certianly no argument here.  I think the proposed strategy on the project in
question is to keep the fans at a minimum ventiltion rate unless high levels
of CO are detected.  
 
Your comments are part of the reason why I wanted to find out if there is
any precedent for claiming credit for reduced garage exhaust fan energy use.

On the topic of garage ventilation...
 
What if the garage exhaust fans could be turned off for a portion of the year. In my case, I have a project that is looking to use the cooling tower to provide half of the exhaust when the cooling tower is on. If the exhaust fans were staged off when the cooling tower was on, would it be reasonable to claim fan energy reduction using hourly report data and suibmit as an exceptional calc?
 
Thanks,
Mitch

Does anyone know if USGBC is allowing credit for CO Control of parking garage ventilation?  If anyone has any experience with successfully getting credit for this efficiency measure can you please let me know.  I am curious what is considered a reasonable baseline.
 

Dear Colleagues;
Short answer: I sure hope not!
 
I very much believe the "reasonable" baseline is CO sensors, so you would schedule the airflows (thus power, if all goes correctly in model land) proportional to some assumed activity schedule. (There is a good summary of what those flows might be in an ASHRAE Jrnl that's about ten years old but on the AJ website.)  CO control is pretty much SOP; I think the IMC, or one of the codes around here, went up to 1.25 cfm/sf constant venting unless CO sensors are used; pretty much assuring everyone uses sensors. There may still be a code req'd floor on the min vent rate even w/sensors. And, in all but the smallest garages, staged fans are typical. MAYBE someone could invent some rationale that if there were some long ducts serving a deep garage, then VSD fans might have a SLIGHTLY lower operating W/cfm and closer tracking of actual req'd dilution air. But not by much.
 
Sure it sounds like "DCV" and the PRM sez we can take credit for that; but we would be creating a baseline considerably worse than typical construction, even 5-10 year old construction. And certainly we can't use 0.7 W/cfm in this baseline. This is why when we get proposals from savvy clients, they specify bldg maximum Btu/sf or kWh/sf or emissions/sf; not some "savings" vs. an artificial baseline. 
 
Fred
 
P.S. Today's Puzzler: What ASHRAE PRM category does a heated parking garage fall into? Does it matter if the heating capacity is more than the semi-conditioned space Btuh/sf rate?

Timothy,
 
Table of the 10-5A (page 65 of the pdf, nominal page 49 of the code)  of
the Washington State Energy Code (link below) provides a pretty handy
table for realistic U-values for various metal frame constructions. I'm
not sure your local municipality would accept it, but I use these tables
frequently to get U-values for various construction types.  Depending on
your frame spacing, it looks like a U-value of around 0.1.

Nick,

Section 5.4.3, Air Leakage, states what parts of the envelope must be
caulked/weatherstripped/etc "to minimize air leakage". It also mentions
that windows & doors must be tested according to NFRC 400, and gives
specific limits of leakage for swinging & revolving doors. But, no
overall number for total infiltration rates.

It sounds to me like infiltration must be the same in both the baseline
and proposed building - appendix G makes no mention of it, and the
entire Performance Rating method requires Section 5.4 to be met, so I
interpret that to mean keeping infil. constant across the models.

All,
While I'm still on my first cup of coffee, and considering the PRM, general "baseline/budget/reference" model philosophy, and others' views on safe ventilation, another answer would be the default "baseline" = "proposed" operation and equipment, where the PRM does not specifically state a baseline. (You could still take credit for a premium efficiency fan motor.)
 
I certainly suspect that savings have been granted to parking garage "DCV" by lenient reviewers, but it has not surfaced in a CIR.  Of course, clients might think it tacky of us to ask for stricter limitations and reduced savings and points in a CIR they pay for, which is a problem with the process. The fact that the baseline is unclear to experienced EA Cr1/PRM modelers says a lot, since there must be a couple million sf of ventilated parking garages rated or in the pipeline.
 
Oh yeah, and what about those heated parking garages under every "green" office and resort hotel? 
 
And as far as "substituting" the cooling tower fan during summer; I would think drawing air through the garage with the CT fan would add some constant load to, or reduce the flow through, that fan, partially offsetting savings from turning off the garage fan (which would have operated at a low load factor if controlled by the typical sensor). 
 
Off to work;
Fred

Hello All,

I am fairly new to eQuest and this is my first post to this group.  I am
modeling a university building which has an air handling unit with a
heating coil and chilled water coil supplied by campus steam and chilled
water.  My problem is that when I add energy recovery to the air system
the space heating energy goes down but my cooling energy goes up as
compared to the proposed building without energy recovery.  I am using a
sensible HX with OA DT of 10 F, OA heating and cooling, mixed air reset,
and modulating the hx.  I hope all this makes sense, but I also tried
setting the energy recovery to only OA heating and the cooling load
still went up considerably.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you and have a great day.

Message-ID: <47B31052.3020904@edi-arch.com>

Has anyone modeled, submitted, and certified a LEED building with a 
glass curtain wall?

I ask because I am wondering how to treat the curtain wall in the 
baseline model. I've tried two scenarios thus far and there is a 10% 
consumption difference between them. The only thing that differs between 
the two is that the lower consuming model has a 40% window-to-wall area 
where the other is still a glass curtain wall, but using Appendix G 
window properties. And to put this in perspective the curtain wall is 
facing NNE and is 3 stories high.

I would also truly appreciate any reference to a LEED CIR regarding this 
issue, if there is one.

Nick,

ASHRAE 90.1 doesn't allow any credit for infiltration savings for commercial
buildings and doesn't have any specific guidance about an allowable air
tightness value.  When using Appendix G or Chapter 11 ECB you need to keep
infiltration the same in both the proposed design and the energy budget.  

The IECC and RESNET HERS offer a method for infiltration savings in
Low-Rise/Single Family Residential.  I believe both methods allow a minimum
as-designed infiltration of ACH = 0.35.  The baseline uses weather factors
from ASHRAE 136 and a Normalized Leakage value of 0.57.  The IECC also
requires a post-construction blower door test to verify the savings.

You could probably propose an exception calculation for infiltration credit
if it followed the IECC residential method and the proposed building was a
small building with simple systems.  I certianly don't think it would be
applicable for a large multi-story building with complex systems.   I think
that you would also need to be able to demonstrate the as-built (post
construction) infiltration rate, through blower door testing or other
appropriate means, as part of proposed exception calculation.

Best regards,

Mike

I agree that CO sensor-controlled garage ventilation is standard practice
and the USGBC should not be allowing savings claimed from this control
method.  But we've submitted a number of projects for LEED with the Baseline
fans on all the time at 0.75 cfm/SF, and assumed the fans on about 1/4 of
this time in the Proposed Building, and the USGBC has allowed it.  We've
always stated our assumptions explicitly.  There should be a CIR to resolve
this, but so far it's been hard to find motivation on a project to spend the
200 bucks to force them to give the project 1 less LEED point.  It's
actually a huge issue for our high-rise condo and office projects....they
would be stretched to say the least to reach the 2 required points without
being able to claim these savings.  Which I think would be a good thing.

I've also worked with a few code jurisdictions around the country who
similarly allow savings from CO vent. control to calculate energy reduction
incentives.

If there's a USGBC person listening in, perhaps they could resolve the issue
with a freebie CIR?

Fred, we are in the process of submitting for CO VFD fan control credit.
I feel that this is still a valid ECM from a LEED perspective for
several reasons:
 
1) the code allows simple fan staging as an alternate compliance path.
However, with no min. # of fans specified one often end sup with just 1
or 2 fans per level. Staged control in this case will not be equivalent
to VFD control.
2) local utilities provide incentives for VFDs , which is a strong
indicator that staged is the default and there are energy savings
available.
3) code allows simple occupancy based controls (on during the day, off
at night) under certain conditions (generally for garages less than
30,000 SF).
 
We are using the code minimum as our definition of standard practice.
Fan powers equal in both cases, just control differences. Have yet to
get feedback from USGBC, but it seems rational to me given other ECMs
that have been credited.
 
Peter

I agree that CO sensor-controlled garage ventilation is standard
practice and the USGBC should not be allowing savings claimed from this
control method.  But we've submitted a number of projects for LEED with
the Baseline fans on all the time at 0.75 cfm/SF, and assumed the fans
on about 1/4 of this time in the Proposed Building, and the USGBC has
allowed it.  We've always stated our assumptions explicitly.  There
should be a CIR to resolve this, but so far it's been hard to find
motivation on a project to spend the 200 bucks to force them to give the
project 1 less LEED point.  It's actually a huge issue for our high-rise
condo and office projects....they would be stretched to say the least to
reach the 2 required points without being able to claim these savings.
Which I think would be a good thing. 

I've also worked with a few code jurisdictions around the country who
similarly allow savings from CO vent. control to calculate energy
reduction incentives.  

If there's a USGBC person listening in, perhaps they could resolve the
issue with a freebie CIR?

	While I'm still on my first cup of coffee, and considering the
PRM, general "baseline/budget/reference" model philosophy, and others'
views on safe ventilation, another answer would be the default
"baseline" = "proposed" operation and equipment, where the PRM does not
specifically state a baseline. (You could still take credit for a
premium efficiency fan motor.)
	 
	I certainly suspect that savings have been granted to parking
garage "DCV" by lenient reviewers, but it has not surfaced in a CIR.  Of
course, clients might think it tacky of us to ask for stricter
limitations and reduced savings and points in a CIR they pay for, which
is a problem with the process. The fact that the baseline is unclear to
experienced EA Cr1/PRM modelers says a lot, since there must be a couple
million sf of ventilated parking garages rated or in the pipeline.
	 
	Oh yeah, and what about those heated parking garages under every
"green" office and resort hotel? 
	 
	And as far as "substituting" the cooling tower fan during
summer; I would think drawing air through the garage with the CT fan
would add some constant load to, or reduce the flow through, that fan,
partially offsetting savings from turning off the garage fan (which
would have operated at a low load factor if controlled by the typical
sensor).

	Does anyone know if USGBC is allowing credit for CO Control of

successfully getting credit for this efficiency measure can you please
let me know.  I am curious what is considered a reasonable baseline.
	 
	
	Dear Colleagues;
	Short answer: I sure hope not!
	 
	I very much believe the "reasonable" baseline is CO sensors, so
you would schedule the airflows (thus power, if all goes correctly in
model land) proportional to some assumed activity schedule. (There is a
good summary of what those flows might be in an ASHRAE Jrnl that's about
ten years old but on the AJ website.)  CO control is pretty much SOP; I
think the IMC, or one of the codes around here, went up to 1.25 cfm/sf
constant venting unless CO sensors are used; pretty much assuring
everyone uses sensors. There may still be a code req'd floor on the min
vent rate even w/sensors. And, in all but the smallest garages, staged
fans are typical. MAYBE someone could invent some rationale that if
there were some long ducts serving a deep garage, then VSD fans might
have a SLIGHTLY lower operating W/cfm and closer tracking of actual
req'd dilution air. But not by much.
	 
	Sure it sounds like "DCV" and the PRM sez we can take credit for
that; but we would be creating a baseline considerably worse than
typical construction, even 5-10 year old construction. And certainly we
can't use 0.7 W/cfm in this baseline. This is why when we get proposals
from savvy clients, they specify bldg maximum Btu/sf or kWh/sf or
emissions/sf; not some "savings" vs. an artificial baseline.

	P.S. Today's Puzzler: What ASHRAE PRM category does a heated
parking garage fall into? Does it matter if the heating capacity is more
than the semi-conditioned space Btuh/sf rate?

I believe RESNET allows for credit for infiltration reduction below 0.35 ACH
for confirmed construction (blower door tested).

In my opinion, leaving out infiltration is a major fault of ASHRAE 90.1 and
Appendix G (and LEED).  Reducing infiltration through good building
techniques and attention to detail can have an enormous impact on building
energy use.  Yes, the building must be tested in order to receive credit,
but infiltration needs to be brought to the attention for designers and
owners.  Also, ensuring that the air barrier is OUTSIDE the insulation (not
the interior sheetrock) is essential to ensuring the performance of the
insulation.

I recently completed an evaluation for an existing historic building about
to undergo renovations.  The biggest single potential energy saver?
Infiltration reduction.  Will we get LEED credit for this?  No.

Thanks for your replies on the subject.  Interesting to note that
there's no credit for reducing infiltration.  I found this article from
a couple of years ago which suggests it might at least be under
consideration for inclusion in an energy standard.

Hi Franc,

I too have spent many hours struggling with ERVs in eQuest.

First of all, a sensible heat recovery ventilator will not recover much
energy during the cooling season.  Remember that energy recovery ventilators
recover nearly no energy at dT less than 5F.  Also, in the summer, the
moisture content of the air is usually higher, so much of the energy
available to be recovered is latent.

Second, running an HRV requires additional fan power.  I have found eQuests
default fan power to be a bit high, so check the these numbers to make sure
they are appropriate for your project.

Third, if a building is equipped with an HRV, but no economizer, the HRV
will be recovering energy when it is not desired.

If the HRV has a bypass for outdoor air, you can set the HRV controls to
allow bypass of OA, set ERV-CAP-CTRL to "bypass OA".  If the air handler
also has an economizer, set ERV-RUN-CTRL to "when minimum OA"

This should bring the cooling energy close to the baseline (and perhaps
slightly lower).  The fan energy will increase.  Savings will vary by
climate.  You may want to experiment with a sensible heat exchanger, if it
is appropriate for the application.  We usually use total energy recovery
wheels, unless they are inappropriate for the application (lab buildings,
for example).


hope this helps.

ought to work if the range checking could be turned off.
 
Ideas or insights, anyone?

Message-ID: <9E3464C4BE9E8447B2DEBFEB0E296F9B0BBB8B4A@FKENTERPRISE.FKUSA.ORG>

Hi, All

I have a question about the purchased heat.

I looked at the standard 2004 Appendix G3.1.1.1 Purchased Heat. 

It is said: For systems using purchased hot water or steam, hot water or steam costs shall be based on actual utility rates, and on-site boilers shall not be modeled in the baseline building design.

 

However in Standard 2004 User Manual, about the purchased heat, it is said: 

Purchased Heat (? G3.1.1.1) For proposed building systems using purchased hot water or steam, the baseline building shall use the same hot water or steam source as used for the proposed building, but with on-site boilers. Costs shall be based on actual utility rates for the purchased steam or hot water.

 

So which one is correct? Definitely, for the baseline case, using the on-side boiler or not would bring a huge difference to the energy consumption for the heating and hot water because of the boiler efficiency curve. Has anyone had this problem before? Thanks a lot.

	Processor
Message-ID: <000101c86eea$d17f6990$747e3cb0$@es>

Hello ? I am a new user in energetic programs and I am working with
Doe2-eQuest.  I have 2 questions which I cannot resolve from the
documentation.

 

[1]  How do I set up the project so I can work with metric units (SI)?  The
eQUEST interface suggests this should be possible since the pull down menu
in ?units of measurement? include an option for metric (as shown in the
screenshot).  

If eQuest cannot work with metric units (SI), there exists any program that
does it?

 

[2] Where can I find the compliance rule processor in Doe2-eQuest?  I need
to incorporate the different European energy code compliance rules, but I
cannot find instructions in the document ?DOE22Vol5-ComplianceAnalysis.pdf?.
Also, I cannot find the program D2RulCmp.exe.

Do you know programs with European energy code compliance rules? Or programs
that it could integrate these compliance rules? What about Energyplus?

 

 

I appreciate in advance any guidance on this.

 

Kind regards

 

Pedro Vizcaino Moreno

I am attempting to model a geothermal system with two water to water source heat pumps that will generate 115? to 120? F water to a supplemental boiler to further raise the temperature to 150? F for the hot water loop of the system. On the hot/chilled water side of the system will be fan coil or induction units. Is this possible to model in eQuest? If so I would really appreciate any guidance/suggestions on how this can be accomplished.

 

Thank you in advance.

Hello All,
Has anyone had success in justifying the energy savings from Harmonic
Canceling Transformers for LEED-NC EAcr1 (option 1 - PRM)?. I know 90.1
Appendix G does not address the topic. 
 
I do see that the Prescriptive Compliance Path of LEED-NC EAcr1 Option
3: Advanced Buildings Core Performance Guide does have energy efficiency
transformers as a Basic Criterion 1.8, but I don't know of any other
mention of transformers in the Reference guide.
 
Any CIRs out there that I may have overlooked or innovation credits
available?
 
Thanks,

It's my understanding that both the Baseline and the Proposed models will both have purchased heat if that's what the Proposed Design has.

Michael - I assume you saw my previous post? (Below).... What I am wondering is how LEED/ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix-G treats glass curtain walls in baseline models: either as a curtain wall with 90.1 climate-specific glass properties or if I need to reduce the amount of glazing to 40% (the prescriptive maximum Window/Wall ratio).

Your thoughts?

*PREVIOUS POST*

Has anyone modeled, submitted, and certified a LEED building with a 
glass curtain wall?

I ask because I am wondering how to treat the curtain wall in the 
baseline model. I've tried two scenarios thus far and there is a 10% 
consumption difference between them. The only thing that differs between 
the two is that the lower consuming model has a 40% window-to-wall area 
where the other is still a glass curtain wall, but using Appendix G 
window properties. And to put this in perspective the curtain wall is 
facing NNE and is 3 stories high.

I would also truly appreciate any reference to a LEED CIR regarding this 
issue, if there is one.

Matthew,

I think what you need to do is pull the opaque portion of the curtain wall out. If the remaining glazing fraction is above 40%, than that portion needs to be reduced in you baseline model.

Michael - I assume you saw my previous post? (Below).... What I am wondering is how LEED/ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix-G treats glass curtain walls in baseline models: either as a curtain wall with 90.1 climate-specific glass properties or if I need to reduce the amount of glazing to 40% (the prescriptive maximum Window/Wall ratio).

Your thoughts?

*PREVIOUS POST*

Has anyone modeled, submitted, and certified a LEED building with a 
glass curtain wall?

I ask because I am wondering how to treat the curtain wall in the 
baseline model. I've tried two scenarios thus far and there is a 10% 
consumption difference between them. The only thing that differs between 
the two is that the lower consuming model has a 40% window-to-wall area 
where the other is still a glass curtain wall, but using Appendix G 
window properties. And to put this in perspective the curtain wall is 
facing NNE and is 3 stories high.

I would also truly appreciate any reference to a LEED CIR regarding this 
issue, if there is one.

Nick,
 
As others have stated, ASHRAE 90.1 does not address infiltration differences
between the baseline and proposed building.
 
Note that there have been some LEED Innovation in Design credits granted for
additional building envelope commissioning.  Please see: 
 
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=3569
 
While this does not account for the energy effects of reduced infiltration
due to improved building design, it does at least allow for a LEED credit
point for the effort.

Hi, I'm wondering if 90.1 makes any stipulations regarding building air
infiltration, for example can there be a difference between proposed design
and energy budget building?  I can't seem to find any reference to facade
air tightness but the standard is a pretty dense document to wade though.
Is there a more easily digested summary available anywhere?

Thanks,

Nick

wouldn't open.  Go to the doe2 equest website and view the equest download

If you have a version of eQUEST dating back to v3.57 or later, then you
already have ALL the current DOE-2.2 documentation, including the Topics
Manual.
All manuals are incorporated into following help file present in any version
of eQUEST since v3.57:
    <eQUEST program directory>\Help\DOE-2.chm
  where <eQUEST program directory> is by default "C:\Program Files\eQUEST

If you would prefer to bring up this help file wihtin the eQUEST detailed

Xiaowei Xu,

I would use the same purchased heat in both baseline and proposed.  In
NYC per btu, Con Ed steam cost approx. 10X more then gas.  This makes
sense because by using steam owners reclaim rentable space, have less
maintenance, less first time equipment cost, don't need a trained
professional to operate a boiler, etc.  Therefore, on an energy
consumption basis both models could be equal, but on a annual cost basis
(as LEED specifies) steam will be much worse.  I believe its LEEDs
intention not to penalize you for such a drastic difference in rates and
wants the same exact purchased heat for both models.  Hope this helps.

	Software Limitations & LEED Rating
Message-ID: <bedef2280802150704lffb7943w22facb573836405c@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Building Simulationists!

We have come across several projects with VRF systems. Although several
publications, including the ASHRAE Journal (April 2007) issue's article
"Variable Refrigerant Flow Systems" by William Goetzler discusses in detail
VRF systems and its efficiency, the limitations of energy modeling software
does not permit to accurately model such systems.

Any insight into the following is much appreciated:

(1) Has anyone had luck modeling a VRF system in Visual DOE? (or EnergyPlus
or eQuest); I "heard" Trace can model VRF system -- can anyone confirm?
Currently, the only way to model a VRF system (in VDoE) is to select "PTAC"
or "PSZ" and modify EER values of the cooling unit. But, this is not even
close to the savings one can achieve in reality. This does not take into
consideration the capacity (heat) of the refrigerant (R-410a, for example).
Is there a procedure developed by ArchEnergy or others energy software
developers to accommodate such systems?

(2) Buildings (or owners / developers) should not be penalized due to the
limitations of energy modeling software!
If ASHRAE 90.1-2004 can stipulate a 10% reduction in LPD for introducing
"Occupancy sensors" in the building, why not introducing a reduction (as a
percentage) for VRF integration until the software are "upgraded"? Why
cannot USGBC accept a flat rate (say, 20% savings) if a VRF system is
integrated in the building?

Need your insight & inputs!

Good day!

Please remember that ASHRAE 90.1 defines fenestration area as the rough
opening for any window assembly including glazing , frame and sash, see the
definitions in Section 3 of the standard.  The minimum performance
requirements for fenestration include the performance of the frames.  The
frame area should be accounted for in your calculation of fenestration area
and performance.

I think what you need to do is pull the opaque portion of the curtain wall

Michael - I assume you saw my previous post? (Below).... What I am wondering
is how LEED/ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix-G treats glass curtain walls in
baseline models: either as a curtain wall with 90.1 climate-specific glass
properties or if I need to reduce the amount of glazing to 40% (the
prescriptive maximum Window/Wall ratio).

Your thoughts?

*PREVIOUS POST*

Has anyone modeled, submitted, and certified a LEED building with a 
glass curtain wall?

I ask because I am wondering how to treat the curtain wall in the 
baseline model. I've tried two scenarios thus far and there is a 10% 
consumption difference between them. The only thing that differs between 
the two is that the lower consuming model has a 40% window-to-wall area 
where the other is still a glass curtain wall, but using Appendix G 
window properties. And to put this in perspective the curtain wall is 
facing NNE and is 3 stories high.

I would also truly appreciate any reference to a LEED CIR regarding this 
issue, if there is one.

Ravi---

To my knowledge,a VRF system can not be explicitly modeled in eQUEST or any other "DOE" modeling software at this time.  The only software I know of that has this system selection is Trace 700 and EnergyPro.  

There has been some discussion of the best way to model this system in eQUEST as it is showing up more and more on projects.  One way that would give you some benefit of "load sharing" is by modeling it as a central WSHP system.  You would have to adjust the compressor efficiency and take out most if not all of the pump energy, but it might be a better approximation than a PTAC or PSZ.  Modeling the VRF condenser as a cooling tower with a VSD might be closer to the truth as well.  The biggest weakness I see is in heating mode.  The WSHP could use an electric boiler, but it would max out with an HIR of 1.  I'm sure the VRF condenser operates with a higher COP.  It's all an educated guess at this point.  

Here's looking forward to further development of eQUEST and other modeling software.

Regards,
Andrew Craig

Dear Building Simulationists!

We have come across several projects with VRF systems. Although several
publications, including the ASHRAE Journal (April 2007) issue's article
"Variable Refrigerant Flow Systems" by William Goetzler discusses in detail
VRF systems and its efficiency, the limitations of energy modeling software
does not permit to accurately model such systems.

Any insight into the following is much appreciated:

(1) Has anyone had luck modeling a VRF system in Visual DOE? (or EnergyPlus
or eQuest); I "heard" Trace can model VRF system -- can anyone confirm?
Currently, the only way to model a VRF system (in VDoE) is to select "PTAC"
or "PSZ" and modify EER values of the cooling unit. But, this is not even
close to the savings one can achieve in reality. This does not take into
consideration the capacity (heat) of the refrigerant (R-410a, for example).
Is there a procedure developed by ArchEnergy or others energy software
developers to accommodate such systems?

(2) Buildings (or owners / developers) should not be penalized due to the
limitations of energy modeling software!
If ASHRAE 90.1-2004 can stipulate a 10% reduction in LPD for introducing
"Occupancy sensors" in the building, why not introducing a reduction (as a
percentage) for VRF integration until the software are "upgraded"? Why
cannot USGBC accept a flat rate (say, 20% savings) if a VRF system is
integrated in the building?

Need your insight & inputs!

Good day!

I am looking for the virtual utility rates but my ES-D report is not
available in the .sim file. Any information about why this would occur
or how to find the virtual rate by another means would be greatly
appreciated.

One of the easiest ways to do this is to create an external shade in the
"detailed edit" mode.  Specify the proper orientation and size and there
you have it.

Hello All,

I am modeling a building that uses district steam for heating.  The
condensate is not returned but rather flushed down the drain.  I would
like to model using this condensate to preheat the DHW, is there any way
to do this in eQuest.  I have created a water to water heat exchanger in
detailed mode but do not understand how to link this to anything.  Any
help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks and have a great day.

I need to model an interiors llighting (luminaire arrangement) for an office building and have to ensure that no direct beam illumination goes out of the glazing.

any suggestion on the best tool/method to do it.

AGi32 is a good bet.  It has a relatively user-friendly, CAD-like interface.  It'll give you virtually any outputs you want and it allows you to import any luminaire data from the major luminaire manufacturers.  Having used it for the first time a few months ago, I'd say you can learn the basics within a few hours.  To figure out if direct illumination "leaving the windows", you can set up a grid of points on the window surface for which it will tell you the illuminance.  You can download a free demo that'll give you five runs or so.  Here's a fairly complete list of other lighting analysis software:

Dear all,

I simulate an office building from ASHRAE Table G3.1 I read that "Vertical
fenestration areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the
Proposed design or 40 % gro? above grade wall, whichever is smaller, an
shall be distrubuted uniformly..."
My office building has in reality almost 80 % fenestration area.
my first Qeustion is;
1)in Proposed and Baseline design the fenestration area must be same or not?
2)in both cases should window area be less than 40%?
3)I read from this email group that 40 % fenestration area requirement not

Umit,

Addendum A removes that statement about uniform distribution, but does not change the area limits. As of April 2007 a design team may use addenda, but you must apply it to the entire LEED submittal (not necessarily all of the addenda, you can use just one if you like, as far as I know)- so you need to read all of Addendum A and follow all of its changes if you want to avoid the area distribution nonsense.

You can find the addenda here: http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/132 

If there are other modifications to the 40% area limit I don't know of them.

In the case you described, the proposed design will have almost 80% 
fenestration (actual fenestration area).  The reference building will 
have 40% glazing.

Cramer,
LEED-NC 2.2 does NOT accept addenda of the Appendix G. Not only the fenestration distribution but any of the requirements changed in any of the addenda are NOT accepted. It is in the definition of the Credit EA1 Optimize Energy Performance. There is also a CIR posted in the usgbc website on the 4/25/2007 for this credit where this question is explained.

Hope it helps,
Carlos

Carlos,

Can you send me a copy of that CIR? I don't have access to CIRs...so much for LEED being an open and transparent proces. I ask because this memo (http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664) says that ashrae addenda are allowed. Also, where in the definition of EAc1 does is say anything about addenda? I've got The Ref Guide for NC 2.2, 3rd Edition October 2007, and there's no mention of addenda that I can find. I'm not trying to nit-pick, but rather make sure I get this right, because of this conflicting info.

Cramer,
LEED-NC 2.2 does NOT accept addenda of the Appendix G. Not only the fenestration distribution but any of the requirements changed in any of the addenda are NOT accepted. It is in the definition of the Credit EA1 Optimize Energy Performance. There is also a CIR posted in the usgbc website on the 4/25/2007 for this credit where this question is explained.

Hope it helps,
Carlos

Umit,

Addendum A removes that statement about uniform distribution, but does not change the area limits. As of April 2007 a design team may use addenda, but you must apply it to the entire LEED submittal (not necessarily all of the addenda, you can use just one if you like, as far as I know)- so you need to read all of Addendum A and follow all of its changes if you want to avoid the area distribution nonsense.

You can find the addenda here: http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/132 

If there are other modifications to the 40% area limit I don't know of them.

Dear all,

I simulate an office building from ASHRAE Table G3.1 I read that "Vertical fenestration areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the Proposed design or 40 % gro? above grade wall, whichever is smaller, an shall be distrubuted uniformly..."
My office building has in reality almost 80 % fenestration area.
my first Qeustion is;
1)in Proposed and Baseline design the fenestration area must be same or not?
2)in both cases should window area be less than 40%?
3)I read from this email group that 40 % fenestration area requirement not aplicable anymore ? is that right?

I met the similar problem when determining the fenestration area for each case.

My project got different fenestration area % on each facade, details see belows:

- North 25%, East 37%, West 37%, South 45%.  The average % for the four orientation is 35.5%.

According to Appendix G, which option should be the fenestration area of the baseline building? 

Option-1: North 25%, East 37%, West 37%, South 40%.  
Option-2: North 35.5%, East 35.5%, West 35.5%, South 35.5%.

Thanks
May

In the case you described, the proposed design will have almost 80% 
fenestration (actual fenestration area).  The reference building will 
have 40% glazing.

Dear colleagues,

I am looking for references concerning DOE2 chiller performance curves.
I know e-Quest library has many default curves for different chiller types and Title 24 Non-residential ACM Manual sets regression constants in Table N2-19 through Table N2-24 for the performance curves of electric chillers (CAP-FT, EIR-FT, EIR-FPLR).

I would like to know how those curves where obtained and if any documentation is available for the survey supporting those figures (number of chillers, manufacturers, assumptions,...)

Thank you in advance.

Message-ID: <3fa6123f0802200527n5d5cf5ecie47bf00082fde0f6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

Was wondering if someone could clarify if a hotel falls under "residential"
within the ASHRAE 90.1 guidelines.  I'm modeling a hotel that is G+6, and is
filled with guest rooms except for the ground floor which includes a lobby
and small cafeteria.  I find that this clarification becomes especially
important when doing the base case model using the guidelines from appendix
G as it makes a large difference in the type of system to use.  In the user
manual, on page G-22 to be specific, The last paragraph states that
"Residential spaces in buildings are used primarily for living and
sleeping.  They include, but are not limited to, dwelling units, hotel/motel
guest rooms, dormitories... etc." And for this reason I have assumed the
building to be residential, but because it says "residential SPACES" instead
of "buildings" I am starting to question it.

Also, has anyone had any experience modeling solar hot water heaters in
VisualDOE and if so, how have you gone about modeling it?

Thanks for the help!

Loren,

 

For building envelope compliance on hotel mixed use projects, using
prescriptive tables (Tables 5.5 in 80.1 2004), I check the required values
using the Residential column U, R, etc values applied to the guestroom areas
and the Nonresidential column values applied to the offices, dining, back of
house, etc. areas.  This is per definitions for Residential and
Nonresidential; for Residential it says "hotel/motel guest rooms".  And,
5.5.1 says for conditioned space, the exterior building envelope shall
comply with either the "nonresidential" or "residential" requirements in
Tables 5.5-1 through 5.5-8.

Hi Everyone,

Was wondering if someone could clarify if a hotel falls under "residential"
within the ASHRAE 90.1 guidelines.  I'm modeling a hotel that is G+6, and is
filled with guest rooms except for the ground floor which includes a lobby
and small cafeteria.  I find that this clarification becomes especially
important when doing the base case model using the guidelines from appendix
G as it makes a large difference in the type of system to use.  In the user
manual, on page G-22 to be specific, The last paragraph states that
"Residential spaces in buildings are used primarily for living and sleeping.
They include, but are not limited to, dwelling units, hotel/motel guest
rooms, dormitories... etc." And for this reason I have assumed the building
to be residential, but because it says "residential SPACES" instead of
"buildings" I am starting to question it.

Also, has anyone had any experience modeling solar hot water heaters in
VisualDOE and if so, how have you gone about modeling it?

Thanks for the help!

Tom,

Thanks for responding so quickly.  Yeah, I have been using those tables for
the building envelope, which come out to be the same residential vs. non
residential in my climate zone, but, sorry, I don't think I clarified my
doubt well enough.  What I am actually more concerned about is the type of
HVAC system to use for the base case model, as a residential building asks
you to use PTAC, but VAV for non-residential.

So what do you do when it comes to the hvac systems?

Thanks!

The way I interpret Appendix G is that you would sum all the glass areas for all facing directions and divide by the sum of the building perimeters for all floors (if different floors have different outlines, you will have to determine perimeters for each unique outline). This will give you a uniform window height to be applied to continuous bands of glazing around the entire perimeter of each floor. Each exterior wall would contain a window of this height that would be the full width of the wall (assuming the exterior walls extend the full height of each floor - if you have you have one exterior wall located above another on a single floor, you obviously wouldn't put such a window in each of those walls. Also, don't forget to allow for frame widths). This will give the uniform bands of windows on each face of the building as described in Appendix G.

Having said all that, I would recommend adhering to Addendum a, which allows you to leave the windows as-designed because the total window area is less than 40% of the gross exterior wall area. You then don't need to make any changes to the windows, however, you should review Addendum a to make sure you are adhering to ALL its requirements - you are not allowed to adhere to only those portions that are convenient and ignore those that aren't.

I met the similar problem when determining the fenestration area for each case.

My project got different fenestration area % on each facade, details see belows:

- North 25%, East 37%, West 37%, South 45%.  The average % for the four orientation is 35.5%.

According to Appendix G, which option should be the fenestration area of the baseline building? 

Option-1: North 25%, East 37%, West 37%, South 40%.  
Option-2: North 35.5%, East 35.5%, West 35.5%, South 35.5%.

Thanks

In the case you described, the proposed design will have almost 80% 
fenestration (actual fenestration area).  The reference building will 
have 40% glazing.

I cannot find this .sim file...

 

I have eQuest autosizing my boilers, chillers and pump GPM's.  In the

Jessi---

The best way to do this is to input the elevator electrical load as an interior load in the Utilty and Economics tab of the Detailed Edit mode of eQUEST.  Under this tab, double click on the electric meter, probably labeled EM1.  In this screen, click on the Direct Loads tab and input your elevators under the Interior Direct Loads table.  After entering a kW rating for your elevator (most likely the BHP of the elevator motor), it will prompt you to input a schedule.  eQUEST has several library elevator schedules that can be accessed by choosing "library" in the schedule pull-down menu.  Good luck and let me know if you have any trouble.

Happy modeling,
Andrew

Hi Linda,
 
Check to be certain that there  exists terminal equipment in your
project containing hydronic heating coils which are actually attached to
the loop in question -- Hot Water Loop B.   An easy way to check this is
to look at the 'Waterside HVAC' tree --  I'll bet you don't see any
systems under the loop in question.
 
Perhaps are all attached to Hot Water Loop A, or the ones you think that
are attached to Loop B have furnaces instead of hydronic heating coils.
 
The error you're getting essentially indicates zero demand for heating
hot water on the loop.
 
HTH...

I have a question of using E-Quest of some areas that I'm unsure of:

 I am running an energy model of a building that has a flat roof on one
side and on the other side has a sloped roof with a drywall ceiling.
How do I take in account of this without having to perform separate
energy models on the same building?

Christopher:
 
Simply make them separate shells (in the Design development or DD
Wizard), just as if you were making serrate building floors (shells).
Screen 2 then allows you in EACH case to set up a flat or sloped roof.
 
If you need a specific roof angle, you should STILL create the two
shells (areas), then create the sloped roof in the Detailed Interface
with a roof tilt.

I have a question of using E-Quest of some areas that I'm unsure of:

 I am running an energy model of a building that has a flat roof on one
side and on the other side has a sloped roof with a drywall ceiling.
How do I take in account of this without having to perform separate
energy models on the same building?

 

Thanks

Hi there-
 
I've been tasked with modeling a parallel fan powered box as my baseline system for ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G, and basically I am wondering if there is anyone who knows of modeling guidelines for that FPB?  I have the capability of modeling any sort of conditions I would like, so I can vary the flow rate of the recirc air, the control sequencing of the fan-assist, and even whether that fan is variable volume or constant volume.
 
I can't find any guidelines that exist anywhere on this topic in ASHRAE 90.1, and this is the first time I've had to model it (I've never designed an electrically-heated building before).  Does anyone know whether:
 
1.)  There is a specific ratio for the amount of recirc air to minimum primary air?
2.)  Whether the amount of recirc air should vary (ie-a variable speed fan)?
3.)  You can just use a real FPB with data from a company like Carrier, and just call it a day on the simultion effort?
 
 
 
Any guidance would be really helpful.
 
 
Thanks in advance,
Chien Harriman

Section G3.1.3.14 of Appendix G hit on requirements for fan powered
boxes.  They are:

 

1.)     FTUs shall be sized for 50% of the peak design flow rate 

2.)     FTUs shall be modeled with 0.35 W/cfm fan power.

3.)     Minimum volume setpoints for FTUs shall be equal to 30% of the
peak design flow rate or the rate required to meet minimum OSA
ventilation, whichever is larger.

4.)     The supply air temperature setpoint shall be constant at the
design condition.

 

Hope that helps.  Good luck.

Hi Andrew, that is really helpful.  I missed that section of the code.
 
Now, a few points that maybe someone could elucidate, maybe even you:
 
1.)  Does 50% of the peak design flow rate imply that, if, for example, the min vol setpoint is 30%, then the recirc coming in parallel is 20%?
2.)  That makes sense, except I am guessing this CFM value is the 50% peak design flow rate?  That would only be logical.
3.)  This min setpoint is for the primary air.
4.)  The design condition they are referring to is the summer design condition, or the winter design condition or both?  I am guessing it is both.
 
 
That is a great help, thanks for everything so far.
 
Sincerely,
Chien

Message-ID: <cdf76d820802211451l7274a6e3t3350145a59865b50@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Has anyone had experience with factoring cogeneration into energy cost of
proposed design for LEED Energy & Atmosphere credits?

For example, generally, how does cost of energy generated using a natural
gas turbine (cogeneration) compare with grid supplied electricity cost? I
understand it's more efficient than grid supplied electricity but is there
cost savings associated with cogen that help with LEED credits?

Thanks in advance,

An example of sizing Fan Terminal Units (FTU)....

 

I have a 1000 cfm zone (determined from peak load conditions) to be
served by a FTU, therefore the parallel fan in my box is sized for 500
cfm (50% of peak flow).  Now typically in heating is when the primary
air is going to go to an absolute minimum.  This must be 300 cfm or the
total volume of OSA that I need for the zone, whichever is larger.  In
theory, the fan could provide all 500 cfm of its air when the primary
air is at a minimum if that meets the load.  The fan will typically
always be the first stage of heating.  After that, if setpoint isn't
met, the reheat coil comes on.  I would say that the design condition,
depending on climate of course, will be cooling dominated 7 times out of
10.

Also, as a note, the discussion of minimum flow setpoint is an area of
weakness for a VAV system.  If the zone was designed for 1000 cfm in
cooling mode and the minimum outside air was determined to be 300 cfm,
you will almost never reach this value when the VAV is operating at part
load.  There is a good article on this in the January issue of
Engineered Systems magazine.

 

Hope this helps.

The increase in heating energy is most likely the result of additional
boiler energy required to offset the reduced motor/pump heat being
transfered to the working fluid when you switched from a constant volume to
a variable volume pumping scheme.

Hello everyone,

 

I need help on CAD imports into eQUEST.   I would like to be able to
take any CAD file, make a pline line around the perimeter and import
that.   What I am unsure of is if coordinates need to match in CAD and
eQUEST.  What are the prerequisites for importing CAD and not getting
BDL or standard writing file error.  Recently I started a model, which
was not drawn by me in CAD.  The zones weren't matching and when I tried
to multiply floors, I got some serious issues.  Some walls disappeared.
The floors were all off of each other.  Each time I tried to open or
iterate the model more errors showed up.   

 

When you check coordinates in the custom drawing "pad" to make sure they
are on the same point, say (0,0)  (0,80) (80,80) (80,0), to make sure
the floors are right on, what must you do?  Do you have to snap to
polygon and get the coordinates matched?  If one Cad floorplan is in a
different part of the coordinate system than it's underlaying floor,
what should you do?  Do you have to check some part of CAD coordinates,
which I find perplexing.  

 

Has anyone had gliches with this?

 

Thanks,

Message-ID: <1272EF6C1E2CB14796327D1DA394577D799360@NDMSEVS33B.ndc.nasa.gov>

I have a building with different roof heights throughout and I have
created a shell for each one, however I can not connect to the east or
west of the original shell I created.  It is set as an exterior wall,
when I want it to be interior.  Is there anyway to either change this
wall to interior or just add the shell directly west of the original
shell?  I have three lined up to the north of the original but now need
to expand the building west.  Any help would be appreciated.

In wizard mode, I would define the ceiling type to be that of the most
predominant type (either adjacent to conditioned space, or underground, or
exterior, if exposed to outdoor air conditions), then, in detailed edit
mode, modify the building shell to reflect the actual conditions.

I think that if you have a roof buried 0-1 feet below grade, you might be
better off modeling the assembly as "exterior wall" but include the 0-1 feet
of soil in the assembly instead of modeling an underground wall, as the
ground at this depth will more closely follow exterior conditions than
ground below about 4' (depending, of course on where you're located).

Does anyone know if the program take into account the depth of the wall when
calculating heat loss through basement walls?

If you create a zone wall in the wizard within 1' of the floorplate 
boundary, it will be an exterior wall.  If you want an interior wall, 
you can back the wall away from the floorplate boundary.  You will have 
to reset the "next-to" keyword once you pull the shells together in 
detailed mode.

You can also simply delete the exterior wall when you go to detailed edit. 

Note that if you are stitching the shells together in the DD wizard, 
checking the "use exact coordinates" box in the 1st tab of the shell 
wizard will help.

(All of this presumes eQUEST of course!)

One technique that has worked fairly well for me is to trace the
footprint and zones for each shell in a new layer of CAD.  Then isolate
that layer and use the "copybase" command while selecting a point on the
floor plan that might be shared by subsequent shells.  It usually makes
most sense to pick a point in the southwest corner of the floor plan.
Create a new CAD drawing and paste the copied layer to point (0,0).  Any
other shells that have unique footprints can be traced in their own
layers and pasted into the sheet you just created.   In eQUEST, always
check the box for "specify exact coordinates" and make sure it is (0,0,
correct height of shell).  Then you should have no trouble importing in
your calibrated CAD file.

 

Good luck.

Hello All,

I have searched the previous posts but have not found an answer to my
problem.  

The architect has changed the size of the building, and the footprint of
the building some what, I have already entered in my custom window
layout and am in deatailed input mode, so my question is:  Is there a
way to modify the building shells to basically take away the middle
portion of the building to correspond to the new layout of the building
or am I going to have to start over??  Any help with this would be
greatly appreciated.  Thank you

You can certainly change the building footprint in detailed edit mode.  
Start with the floor footprint.  Go to the building shell, 2D 
representation and select the "Shape view mode" on the floating toolbar 
(icon with red polygon & black dots).  Now you can edit the floor 
footprint.  Herein lies the first challenge.  Your spaces will be linked 
to the vertex numbers of the floor.  So, as you add new floor vertexes, 
the spaces will appear to "blow up" as they now reference the wrong 
vertexes.  Typically you can bring them back into line fairly easily by 
increasing the number of the reference vertex by the number of vertexes 
you added to the floor plate.  (Note, deleting vertexes is a little 
trickier as you cannot reference deleted vertexes so you will have to 
move the spaces first.)

Once the floor is correct, now you use the same procedure to edit the 
spaces.  Note that the CAD file you referenced in the wizard should 
still be available and new CAD files can be referenced using the 
"floating toolbar" "Open CAD drawing file" and "CAD file drawing 
properties" buttons.  You can select just the drawing and pan and zoom 
it so it matches your building then edit the spaces.

Just as the spaces reference the floor vertexes, the walls reference the 
space vertexes so the wall vertex references may need to be updated as 
you add or delete vertexes from each space. 

Good luck!

Message-ID: <F94102E3F5278A41AE61586593CB4844025A5268@sv04005.rmf.com>

I have an energy model where the roof has an unusual shape.  To make a
long point short the roof is sloped but it breaks in the middle so it's
part flat roof and part sloped roof.  Also in the shell component screen
it asks the height for floor to ceiling and the height for floor to
floor.  What do you do when it's a single story building?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Altitude impact on airflow and fan power in eQUEST
Message-ID: <553221.71413.qm@web32103.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi guys,

I faced an interesting situation when I used eQUEST to model a simple roof-top unit conditioned small one-zone building in Calgary, Canada. The Altitude of Calgary is 1050m (3444 ft). When I put the altitude value in the "site data", in the ASHRAE basecase, the autosized fan airflow rate was multified by 1.14, which is correct. However, I found the the fan power was not multiplied while it should be multiplied. Meanwhile, the outdoor airflow rate was also multiplied by 1.14 which should not be multiplied.

Some data for you reference,
1. Altitude factor included: system air flow rate by autosizing is 8830 cfm, according to Appendex G3.1.2.8 and G3.1.2.9, the fan powe should be 6.4 kW, the calculated fanpower by eQUEST is 5.61 kW (6.4/1.14) (SV-A report). I input the outdoor air flow rate as 1320 cfm, then the SV-A reports it as 1505 (1320*1.14).

2. If I did not input the altitude factor, the autosized system air flow rate is 7746 cfm, eQUEST calculated fan power is 5.62 kW, which matches with ASHRAE G3.1.2.9 value and outdoor air flow goes back to 1320 cfm.

Does any one knows what is the problem in the eQUEST calculation? I try to solve this problem by put the system sizing ratio as 1.14 and altitude as 0 to represent the altitude factor. Is this method OK for the  LEED requirement?

Thanks a lot.

Regards,

Zhen

Hi Everyone,

Knows somebody if eQuest units can be converted in SI ( more clearly - if all inputs and outputs can be obtained in SI unuits). Normally we work for Europeans customers and  they are not so familiar with IP units. For this reasons we have more limits when  we must explain / provide them results and reports.
   
  Thank you in advance , 
   
  All answers will be appreciate

All,

I am modeling a mixed use building in eQUEST that would have hotel and
office spaces among others.

The project is in schematic design phase and for a model at such a stage,
are there recommended assumptions or guidelines for cooking loads and
profiles, self contained refrigeration loads and profiles and other process
loads? (there are two different restaurant and kitchen spaces in the design
right now)

Thank you,

Hello all,

The reason I am looking at this is because I am trying to reduce the

unoccupied hours because the number on unmet hours did not change if I
dramatically increased the size of the cooling and heating.  I want to

Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks,

Steve:
 
The setback temps are defined in the Cooling and Heating day schedules.
Look down the left side in the Component tree. There should be Heat-Sch
and Cool-Sch. for one or more SYSTEMS.  Open these schedules and they
define the temperature for each hour of a day. The default breakdown is
weekday and weekend, but you can define other days as well (especially
if the building has different seasonal type use). A typical setback
schedule for cooling might be 12Mid-8AM, 85 DegF, 8AM - 6PM, 72 DegF, 6
PM-12 Mid, 85 DegF. You need to input the temperature for the day, hour
by hour.
 
Don't forget the fan. You need to put a 1 (Always ON) from 8 AM - 6 PM,
and a 0 (Zero) for the other hours. The zero says that the fan will not
come on unless the temperature for the space for that hour was
exceeded.. If you set in 85 DegF and a 4 DegF deadband, the temperature
in the space will need to become 87 DegF to warrant the fan coming on.
 
If you input a -1, the fans will NEVER come on for that hour.
 
Hope this helps.

Hello All, 

I am trying to model a hybrid ground source heat pump system (boiler and fluid cooler).  Does anyone know how to do this using eQuest??  I have created the GLHX and attached a fluid cooler and a boiler, however eQuest will not run the simulation with the boiler attached to the loop.  If anyone has experience with this type of simulation I would any help that you can offer.  Thanks

What if it is an existing building, in which case, "the baseline
building design shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions
that are part of the scope of work being evaluated."  (From Table G3.1
No. 5 (f).)  Do I ignore items (a) through (e) in their entirety,
including no self-shading (and, for that matter, the whole
average-of-four-orientations requirement)?  And there is still the
question of shading from adjacent buildings.

All: 

As Xiaobing mentioned, ASHRAE recently funded a research project (RP-1384)
to simulate hybrid GSHP systems
The main goal of the project is to establish
general design guidelines for sizing/controlling these systems (targeted at
designers).  The project has been completed; reports and publications should
be released in the near future.  But the model (built using the
well-validated TRNSYS ground loop model) will also be released in a
distributable format that can be used by anyone, for design, system
optimization, research, etc.  The official version of this distributable
program would be available sometime after the report.

Hello all,

ASHRAE 90.1-2004 section G3.1.2.2 mentioned that equipment shall be oversized by 15% for cooling and 25% for heating for the basecase building. In eQUEST under "Air-side HAVC" we can put "Cooling sizing ratio" as  1.15 and "Heating sizing ratio" as 1.25. Do we need to put system sizing ratio for fan under "Basics/system sizing/sizing ratio"? If we do need to put a sizing ratio, should it be 15% or 25% oversized"?

Thanks a lot for your response.

Regard,

David

I didn't see an answer to this yet, so my apologies if it has already been
addressed.
 
If I understand your situation correctly, the fan power should NOT be
multiplied.  The CFM goes up because of the reduced density at altitude.
However, the mass flow does not change because of altitude--it is whatever
is necessary to satisfy the load.   Power is a function of mass flow, not
CFM, so the power doesn't change.
 
Similarly, I think the outdoor airflow rate should increase, otherwise the
ventilation mass flow would be decreased at altitude.   Also, for the
packaged unit, the proportions of ventilation and return air will be
constant for constant damper positions, so if the total CFM goes up the
ventilation CFM would increase proportionally.
 
Therefore, my opinion is that the eQuest calculation is OK.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Altitude impact on airflow and fan power in eQUEST


Hi guys,

I faced an interesting situation when I used eQUEST to model a simple
roof-top unit conditioned small one-zone building in Calgary, Canada. The
Altitude of Calgary is 1050m (3444 ft). When I put the altitude value in the
"site data", in the ASHRAE basecase, the autosized fan airflow rate was
multified by 1.14, which is correct. However, I found the the fan power was
not multiplied while it should be multiplied. Meanwhile, the outdoor airflow
rate was also multiplied by 1.14 which should not be multiplied.

Some data for you reference,
1. Altitude factor included: system air flow rate by autosizing is 8830 cfm,
according to Appendex G3.1.2.8 and G3.1.2.9, the fan powe should be 6.4 kW,
the calculated fanpower by eQUEST is 5.61 kW (6.4/1.14) (SV-A report). I
input the outdoor air flow rate as 1320 cfm, then the SV-A reports it as
1505 (1320*1.14).

2. If I did not input the altitude factor, the autosized system air flow
rate is 7746 cfm, eQUEST calculated fan power is 5.62 kW, which matches with
ASHRAE G3.1.2.9 value and outdoor air flow goes back to 1320 cfm.

Does any one knows what is the problem in the eQUEST calculation? I try to
solve this problem by put the system sizing ratio as 1.14 and altitude as 0
to represent the altitude factor. Is this method OK for the  LEED
requirement?

Thanks a lot.

Regards,

Zhen

You are going to want to open the BDL file in a text editor.  Go to the

This should clue you in to what schedule is missing the "&D".

Bill is correct.  Fan power is a function of static pressure and mass flow,
it is not directly a function of CFM.  However, if the the ductwork was
sized the same at altitude as at sea level, then the increased CFM at
altitude would result in an increased velocity and static pressure loss. In
this case, the supply static pressure should be increased.  (The increase in
static pressure would be approximately linear with CFM, rather than the
square, as the density is less, and static is proportional to density*V*V.)

1. Altitude factor included: system air flow rate by autosizing is 8830 cfm,
according to Appendex G3.1.2.8 and G3.1.2.9, the fan powe should be 6.4 kW,
the calculated fanpower by eQUEST is 5.61 kW (6.4/1.14) (SV-A report). I
input the outdoor air flow rate as 1320 cfm, then the SV-A reports it as
1505 (1320*1.14).

2. If I did not input the altitude factor, the autosized system air flow
rate is 7746 cfm, eQUEST calculated fan power is 5.62 kW, which matches with
ASHRAE G3.1.2.9 value and outdoor air flow goes back to 1320 cfm.

Does any one knows what is the problem in the eQUEST calculation? I try to
solve this problem by put the system sizing ratio as 1.14 and altitude as 0
to represent the altitude factor. Is this method OK for the  LEED
requirement?

Thanks a lot.

Zhen

Message-ID: <542757.36354.qm@web32104.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Thanks Steve and Bill for your kind response.

I think this is really interesting issue to me and maybe to other people doing the energy simulation for LEED according to ASHRAE 90.1-2004.

In my proposed case, the engineer designed the system air flow rate as 10000 cfm and outdoor air flow rate as 1320 cfm. When I input the altitude of 3444 ft in the site data, and the air flow rate and outdoor air flow rate (10000 cfm  and 1320 cfm) in the air-side HVAC, I will get 11400 cfm and 1505 cfm in the SV-A report. Should I input values divided by 1.14 (e.g. 8772 cfm, and 1158 cfm) in eQUEST inputs?

In the corresponding ASHRAE basecase, when I input the altitude of 3444 ft in the site data, the sized system air flow rate will also multiplied by 1.14 (e.g from 7746 cfm without altitude factor to 8830 cfm). Bill is right. The fan power is  related to  mass flow rate. But the problem is in ASHRAE 90.1-2004 G3.1.2.8 and G3.1.2.9, the basecase building fan power has nothing to do with the air density but air flow rate only. In this case, the basecase building fan power will also roughly mutliplied by 1.14 (e.g. from 5.61 kW without altitude factor to 6.4 kW). Steve, if I undertand you comments correctly, so we also need to increase the fan pressure drop to get the same fan power of 6.4 kW which corresponding to the 8830 cfm air flow rate. Is this correct?

I appreciate your help.

Regards,

Zhen

Fan power is a function of static pressure and mass flow, it is not directly a function of CFM.  However, if the the ductwork was sized the same at altitude as at sea level, then the increased CFM at altitude would result in an increased velocity and static pressure loss. In this case, the supply static pressure should be increased.  (The increase in static pressure would be approximately linear with CFM, rather than the square, as the density is less, and static is proportional to density*V*V.)

  I didn't see an answer to this yet, so my apologies if it has already been addressed.
   
  If I understand your situation correctly, the fan power should NOT be multiplied.  The CFM goes up because of the reduced density at altitude.  However, the mass flow does not change because of altitude--it is whatever is necessary to satisfy the load.   Power is a function of mass flow, not CFM, so the power doesn't change.
   
  Similarly, I think the outdoor airflow rate should increase, otherwise the ventilation mass flow would be decreased at altitude.   Also, for the packaged unit, the proportions of ventilation and return air will be constant for constant damper positions, so if the total CFM goes up the ventilation CFM would increase proportionally.
   
  Therefore, my opinion is that the eQuest calculation is OK.

  Hi guys,
 
 I faced an interesting situation when I used eQUEST to model a simple roof-top unit conditioned small one-zone building in Calgary, Canada. The Altitude of Calgary is 1050m (3444 ft). When I put the altitude value in the "site data", in the ASHRAE basecase, the autosized fan airflow rate was multified by 1.14, which is correct. However, I found the the fan power was not multiplied while it should be multiplied. Meanwhile, the outdoor airflow rate was also multiplied by 1.14 which should not be multiplied.
 
 Some data for you reference,
 1. Altitude factor included: system air flow rate by autosizing is 8830 cfm, according to Appendex G3.1.2.8 and G3.1.2.9, the fan powe should be 6.4 kW, the calculated fanpower by eQUEST is 5.61 kW (6.4/1.14) (SV-A report).

Message-ID: <F94102E3F5278A41AE61586593CB4844025CF556@sv04005.rmf.com>

Good Afternoon,

I have some quick questions about the DOE e-quest software:

1.  According to ASHRAE 90.1 you are supposed to model the conditioned
spaces in a building to simulate heating and cooling even if the
proposed design doesn't call for heating.  The system(s) in question is
connected to a chilled water loop from a central energy plant but the
space calls for no heating and the central energy plant does not have
boilers, it has only chillers, pumps, and cooling towers.  Therefore how
do I suppose to simulate a building that doesn't call for heating for
this type of situation?

2.  In the 3-D view I have the building modeled exactly the way I need
it to appear except one part of the roof needs to be sloped.  I have
tried the pitched roof and it pitches both ways when I only need it
sloped one way?  How do I make this possible?

Thanks

Ying---

In the Public Review Draft of Appendix G that will appear in ASHRAE
90.1-2007, they revised G.1.3.12 to read: "The air temperature for
cooling shall be reset higher by 5 deg F..."  So I think you are fine in
just creating a cooling reset schedule.

Ying,

If you have a heating coil in the air handler one needs to inputm the HOT DECK MAX LEAVING TEMP (HEAT SET-T)- and this enable the Heat Control input. The HOT DECK MAX LEAVING TEMP (HEAT SET-T) should be set to the primary air temperature leaving the air handler. If the HEAT SET-T air temperature is not specified, the primary air temperature will be the mixed air temperature, which could result in a significant increase in reheat energy depending on the climate. 
Hope this helps,
Mitch

How does changing the glazing of a historic building affect the way it's

Ramana,

 

I posted this two days ago:

 

"What if it is an existing building, in which case, "the baseline
building design shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions
that are part of the scope of work being evaluated."  (From Table G3.1
No. 5 (f).)  Do I ignore items (a) through (e) in their entirety,
including no self-shading (and, for that matter, the whole
average-of-four-orientations requirement)?  And there is still the
question of shading from adjacent buildings."

 

So your LEED baseline should reflect the existing building envelope,
including fenestration.  (But I am still uncertain about ignoring items
(a) through (e) in Table G3.1 No.5.)

 

Also note that in the LEED NC 2.2 Errata posted 10/31/2007, the text for
the entire Credit EAc1 has been replaced.  (I have not done a
line-by-line comparison to see what changed.):

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED EA Cr1 and historing building alteration

 

Dear all,

How does changing the glazing of a historic building affect the way it's
modeled in the baseline case for LEED EA Cr1? Would the baseline have to
be ASHRAE 90.1 compliant or can it still be an exception?

Thanks,

Mitch,
Thank you. Yes, the air handler has a heating coil. I also input HOT DECK MAX
LEAVING TEMP (95F), zone entering max supply temp (92), and reheat delta T
(40).
The other input for "heating control and reset" are all in grey except the
avalability schedule". Don't know the reason.

Ok, perhaps I haven't set done that right.  I have cool-control on warmest
with airflow first.  The max and min cooling reset temp represent a 10
degree difference.  The min being the temperature that is the 20 degree
difference supply-air to room-air temp of 55.  Is this in fact not right,
should it be cool-control set to reset?  Do we use a reset-temp or
reset-ratio?  And should we be referencing high and low outdoor temperature
setpoints for this?  This is definitely an issue for me right now because it
represents a swing in energy cost savings of two points.

I am still not understanding.  Do you set cool control to "reset" or to
"warmest"?  If it is set to "reset", then the supply air temperature is in
relation to the outdoor temperature and that is not G3.1.3.12.  If it is set
to "warmest" there is not an option to enter a cool reset schedule because
it is grey'd out.  There is, however, a max and min cooling reset temp and a
minimum reset flow.  You also have your min heating reset temp opened up.  I
originally did this point by making cool control range equal to 10 because
it sounds good in the help file although this is in reference to the cooling
coil.  Silly me.

I set in the same way but set the cool control to "reset" and referece high
and
low outdoor temp set points.

I think it's up to the analyst; the initial versions of the PRM that called for a 10F reset also specifically referenced control from the zone level, but the new text does not. Part of the reason for the change is that supply air dehumidification might be needed even if all the zones were adequately sensibly cooled. Unfortunately, other sections of 90.1 include economizer operation as "cooling," so the current language referencing reset during "the minimum cooling load conditions," provides some leeway for a baseline, but it sounds to me like when the coil is off should qualify.
 
Also the DOE-2.2 COOL-CONTROL = WARMEST setting often produces odd hourly results (all coils off and SAT = MAT,  jumping to HEAT-SET-T, etc.) I think these issues have to do with the program response to zone temp setback/up, but I'm tired of trying to figure it out. Don't even get me started on morning warmup.
 
So I think modeling an OA reset schedule (COOL-CONTROL = RESET; COOL-RESET-SCH = something) is the way to go. Typically reset SAT up to 60F at OAT below 55F. With the HEAT-SET-T = 60F, not 90F or something; that's what MAX-SUPPLY-T should be, which is the air temperature downstream of the reheat coil.
 
If the proposed design doesn't reset SAT the way the PRM baseline is written, and this proposed system has a central heating coil which is needed to maintain the SAT at high OA fractions during cold weather, the PRM seems to contradict itself. It also states that the baseline "preheat" coil will be controlled in the same manner as the proposed coil, and generally heating the primary air in a VAV AHU is done by a "preheat" coil, even if this is not what that coil is called in DOE-2, and even if the simulation controls it via a "COOL-CONTROL" statement. 
 
As a matter of principle, I would be very leery of claiming any PRM/LEED savings for a reset strategy better than the baseline definition; can the persistence of those control settings be guaranteed? Does the simulation really model both cases accurately? Is the baseline SAT reset defined precisely? 
 
Clear as mud?
