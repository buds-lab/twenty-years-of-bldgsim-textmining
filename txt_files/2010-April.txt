Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQUEST Chiller COP
Message-ID: <v2rc229d8ab1004010327l3a0e79dne4ff59c27d5aeafa@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I tried to use eQUEST to generate simulation for different chiller system
and collect data about the overall efficiency of the chiller units.

For this simulation i used 2 units of 450 tons chiller set at COP of 6.

I then refer to the report PS-C, to compute the overall COP (Using cooling
load / electricity used)

Something im not sure about is when i get the detailed report, for some
cases like reciprocating hermetic chiller, centrifugal hermetic variable
speed chiller and centrifugal open variable speed chiller, i get an overall
COP of 6.1- 6.3 which are higher than the set COP of 6.

Im wondering if my way of calculating overall COP makes any sense and how
can i explain the situation where the actual performance are higher than the
pre-set COP.

Any comments or advise on this?

Hi Ashraf,

 

First of all I would like to know that which software you are using for
Energy Simulation. If eQuest, go through my comments in red.

 

1.	It is unclear whether one Baseline Constant Volume system was
modeled per thermal zone in the Baseline Case as required. Please verify
that one system was modeled per zone, and that the Baseline System
efficiency for each zone was modeled consistently with the capacity for the
Baseline System serving that zone. (please guide me how to solve this
comment)-  Clarify your baseline system and Fan control type from Table
G3.1.1.A and Table G3.1.1B as per your building area or no. of floors and
also confirm that that your system efficiency meets the section 6.4.1.1.

 

 

2.	Section G3.1.2.9 describes calculation used to determine the fan
power in the baseline building. Please list the total fan volume,
capacities, and fan power for the Baseline and Proposed system. (As my
system doesn?t have any Return fan, so i am dividing the ASHRAE total Fan
power by 70% supply, 20% return, 10% exhaust based on my understanding.
Please guide me if any changes required)- Reviewer is not asking about the
Return fan, reviewer has asked for model the Fan power in baseline system as
per table G3.1.2.9. Thus you should model the kW/CFM in baseline system as
per formula of Baseline Fan Brake Horsepower in Table G.3.1.2.9. Please see
attached Fan power document to model the kW/CFM in eQuest.

 

 

3.	Based on supporting document, supply fan volumes of some of the
zones in the baseline design appear to be modeled as ?AUTOSIZED?. For the
baseline design the fan supply volumes should be calculated based on the
system capacity and a temperature differential of 20?F, as set forth in
Section G3.1.2.8.(Please guide me Where can we enter the temperature diff,
is in Cooling Coil or any other ways.) ? As per Table G3.2.8, baseline
building design shall be based on a supply-air-to-room-air temperature
difference of 20?F. Its means that if your room temperature is 75?F then the
zone entering minimum supply temperature should be 55?F. (Excerpt attached
to model the zone entering minimum supply temperature).

 

Let me know if you get any other comments on this.

Just picked up on something concerning me...

 

Entry #6584 for "Solarban 60 Clr/Arg/Clr 3" lists a Visible
Transmittance (TVIS) of 0.45.  When I select this entry within eQuest,
eQuest tells me it has VT = 0.72 (which notably matches the Solarban
literature).

 

This is throwing me off a bit... I thought VT and TVIS are the same
thing...  If not, what is the difference and which should we be using to
determine the percentage of light within the visible spectrum that
transmits through glass?

 

Is this possibly just a typo in the DOE2 Glass library (as accessed

Tvis and VT are the same thing, just different nomenclature.  WINDOW program
gives VT=Tvis=0.723 for this configuration, so it must be a typo.

The first comment seems like the reviewer isn't 
carefully reviewing the submission.  It is fairly 
simple to check the proposed sim file and the 
Budget case sim file to see if each zone in the 
proposed case is modelled as a single zone system 
in the Budget case.  I have seen this comment 
before and I am not sure what additional 
documentation the review might want to make it "clearer".

Comment 2: I always setup a spreadsheet showing 
my calculation of total fan power for the proposed case and the Budget case.

Comment 3: The 20?F differential is the 
difference between the room set point and the 
supply air temperature.  Re Autosizing supply air 
flows: I always autosize the Baseline air flows 
based on the 20?F supply air to room air 
temperature difference (G3.1.2.8).  I set the 
heat sizing ratio to 1.25 and the cool sizing 
ratio to 1.15 as per G3.1.2.2.  Never had a 
problem with this approach.  I suppose you could 
do a sizing run with those sizing ratios then 
explicitly enter the resulting supply air flows, 
heating and cooling capacities but it would 
amount to almost the same results.

Appeasing the GBCI reviewers is always about proper documentation.  They shouldn't have to go thru every zone/system in your .inp file to make sure there is a corresponding system.  Hell, it's hard enough for us to do that (without being able to open up eQuest).

 

Comment #1:  Plain and simply state:  The baseline building has been configured so that each thermal zone has a corresponding system, and the thermal zones for the baseline building match the proposed building.  (and you just need to make sure this is the case - if you have an unconditioned zone attached to a system, you might want to say that the unconditioned zone has no impact on the system, but eQuest requires each zone to have an associated system and thus you have to have it share a system with a conditioned zone).

 

Comment #2:  Like Chris said, make a spreadsheet, and use it for every project.  The small amount of time it takes to program excel to determine if the CFM is > or < than 20,000 CFM and automatically use the correct formula will pay for itself quickly.

 

Comment #3:  Plain and simply state:  eQuest's autosize routine is based on the 20 degree delta T that we have entered for each system (show a screenshot of that eQuest tab to help back this up, and circle in red).  Therefore, although it is autosized, the CFM is correctly configured based on this 20 degree delta T, and thus specific entry of CFM quantities in the system tabs is not required.

We use Trace 700 for our building loads and energy modeling for LEED.  Would
there be any benefit to also start using equest for energy modeling?

Is it hard to learn?  What would be the benefit?

Also, find out how the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's)
online Target Finder
<http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=new_bldg_design.bus_target_finder
>  tool can help you determine if your projects meet 2030 fossil fuel
energy reduction goals. Target Finder provides whole-building energy use
targets and a score for the relative efficiency of the intended energy
use for commercial building design projects, which indicates if designs
could ultimately qualify for ENERGY STAR. 

The EPA energy performance scale is supported by the U.S. Conference of
Mayors, AIA, ASHRAE, USGBC, Architecture 2030, and many state and local
governments.

I've already checked out the info on ashrae.org; the sample exam questions are limited so it is tough to get a feel for the overall exam content and rigor.

Very rigorous!  The guidebook is not joking about requiring two years of experience on modeling projects as an eligibility to take the exam.

The Detailed Content Outline in the guidebook should give you an excellent idea of the topics.

David,

 

Do you know how many people took the paper exam at the ASHRAE conference?
It looks like almost 60 passed the debut exam based on the list of BEMPs at
http://cms.ashrae.biz/certification/BEMP.php.  I am scheduled to take the
computerized exam later this month.

 

Thank You,

 

Dan

I am trying to do energy model for 3 buildings in a campus. Each

Yuvaraj---

 

This is addressed directly in the LEED Reference Guide for Green
Building Design and Construction, 2009 Edition.  Starting on page 267
they go through various central plant scenarios and how they should be
treated.  For a district CHP, they reference the same "Required
Treatment of District Thermal Energy, May 2008" that you mention below.
I don't see it clearly addressed, but it seems that you should replace
any reference to 90.1-2004 to 90.1-2007 for a LEED 2009 project if
that's what you used to develop the baseline.  Might be worth a CIR
though?  Good luck.

I gave a presentation on this subject in November and the v3 equivalent document was "coming any day now" back then - I haven't seen it yet, although I'm pretty sure someone is working very hard on generating one.  I haven't looked for it since then either.  If not, you can probably use the current Reference Guide along with the 2.2 DES document.

I'm not sure if there will be other major changes to how the comparisons are structured, or changes in the default DES efficiencies.

Also, will the DES plant be included with one of the three certifications?  Then at least you may only have to guess for two of the projects!

Dan,

 

The total list of BEMP certification-earners, as identified at http://cms.ashrae.biz/certification/BEMP.php, includes the following groups:

(a) individuals who passed the exam when it was administered in Orlando

(b) individuals who passed the exam since it has become available at testing centers worldwide

(c) members of the examination development and review committee, who not only wrote the exam items, but also in essence "took" the exam multiple times because of the iterative nature of the review process

Thanks all for your replies!

 

I found the following excerpt from USGBC website:

 

"District Thermal Energy Treatment
<http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176>  (PDF) -- Treatment
of Energy & Atmosphere prerequisites and credits for LEED buildings that
are connected to a district thermal energy system. LEED 2009 projects
should follow the guidance in this document until the LEED 2009 DES
document is posted. Please note that any mention of the 2-point minimum
in this document should be translated to apply towards the minimum EAp2
prerequisite for LEED 2009."

 

Interestingly, it talks about the minimum 2 point requirement but not
about ASHARE standard. I think it is logical to follow Heathers
suggestion and use 2007.

Yuvaraj

Yuvaraj,

    As far as I know they have not released a new document specifically
for LEED v3. I would assume that you can use the document you have
listed below, reference ASHRAE 90.1-2007 (not 2004), and include a note
about the assumption in your EAc1 narrative.

Not to complicate the subject. One additional question in this subject.

 

This project is in California. Another USGBC guideline states that
Title 24 - 2005 is equivalent to ASHRAE 90.1-2004. LEED V3 also allows
to use a Title 24 as baseline. So, if I want to use Title - 24 as my
baseline for the LEED purpose (to avoid additional modeling) how do I do
that? USGBC guideline  for DES "Required Treatment of District Thermal
Energy in LEED-NC version 2.2 and LEED for Schools" primarily talks
about ASHRAE 90.1 in the step 2 when changing systems. Any suggestion is
greatly appreciated.

Yuvaraj

in LEED-NC version 2.2 and LEED for Schools" dated May 28, 2008, which
discusses about how to carry out the energy modeling. I am wondering is
there a similar document for LEED version 3. If there is no such
document released by USGBC for version 3, then if I follow the
aforementioned document, the problem I have is, it reference everything
back to ASHRAE 90.1-2004 but LEED V3 follows 90.1-2007. Can anyone guide
me how to approach this situation?

 

Thanks,

Yuvaraj

Brian,

 

There is talk of ASHRAE running a training course soon ? 

 

And well done to Dave, you must be one of the very few ASHRAE BEMP's about !

 

Are there any people out there interested in forming a study group ?  We
have ASHRAE and IBPSA Forums on www.linkedin.com <http://www.linkedin.com/>
that would provide a home and allow all us to gather and share study
material.  

 

ASHRAE Fundamental seems to be a good starting point, but which chapters ?
The 90.1 User Manual is the cornerstone ?  The books by Muneer and Moss are
definatelly required reading anyway, but the Stein / Reynolds book is a slab
of a book and may only help non-US people get up to speed with US
terminology. 

 

I don't have any of the CIBSA material yet - how useful is the Applications
Manual AM11: 1998, Building energy and environmental modeling ?  It seems a
little long in the teeth ?

 

The ASHRAE Standards are required for any LEED work anyway

 

For those of us outside the US, the ASHRAE BEMP and HBDP exams are an
important opportunity to stand out in a world of "dabblers", and probably
the only way to benchmark yourself against the international community.

 

   Thanks,

Hello Michael,
IBPSA-USA is planning on offering an HVAC systems simulation course at  
the SimBuild 2010 conference this summer. While it is not a BEMP  
"prep" course, it will cover many of the topics that are included on  
the exam, plus more. You may have seen the RFP that was recently  
issued. There was also an RFP for a lighting simulation course. The  
intent for these courses is that they can be repeatable and widely  
used, both in the US and internationally.
Best,

Shanta Tucker
Secretary, IBPSA USA
(sent from my mobile email device)

Hello Mike:

To follow up on Shanta's email, IBPSA-USA is also now planning a half dozen or so additional energy modeling workshops across the US over the next year using the material from the HVAC systems simulation course at the SimBuild 2010 conference this summer. It would seem a logical extension for IBPSA-USA to collaborate with various international IBPSA chapters and possibly other organizations (ASHRAE, etc) to organize and present this material in 1- or  2-day workshops worldwide.  As Shanta has said, the intent for these courses is that they can be repeatable and widely used, both in the US and internationally.

Cheers,   

Joseph J. Deringer, AIA, LEED AP

Mike, et al

 

Yes, I'd join in on this study group, so please do set it up.  I'd join it
for sure and you'd probably have at least 3 or 4 other members from ZED too.

 

Like you , we at ZED-UK believe that this assessment is going to be a good
way to stand out from the crowd. 

 

My only slight concern is whether this is going to just be a matter of
learning ASHRAE 90.1 etc inside out and then being tested on that or is it
going to be a more in depth look at whether you know what the principles of
building physics are? 

 

Can anyone give me a clue on this?

 

I have taught Building Physics and Computational Modelling both within
academia and as a trainer for commercial software providers.  I try and
teach some principles even within my short 3 day software courses as it's
imperative to do so, in order that people can get a grasp of why you do
certain things in models, particularly in a low energy passive naturally
ventilated building.  This sort of work seems to me to be partly contrary to
ASHRAE regulations require and so I'm just wondering if my slightly lesser
knowledge of exact types of systems will be a hindrance.  I know the
fundamentals and general elements of most systems having served my
apprenticeship as a BMS controls engineer, but I am not a complex system
mechanical HVAC designer.  I am a physicist after all, that's what my PhD is
in.

 

The AM11 book, in my view although getting quite old now, is a really good
guide in how to scope and carry out a simulation study.  It is however quite
a bit out of date, particularly when you look at the tools it has used.
We've suggested a re-write to CIBSE a few times and I think it will happen
at some point, but I think it's going to take a while.

 

Cheers

Paul

Oswaldo,
?
these professionals would like some info on the BEMP certification exam study material, perhaps you could give some ideas that could help.
?
Paul,
Whenever you have that group formed, I would like to participate,
?
Thanks,

Mike, et al
?
Yes, I?d join in on this study group, so please do set it up. ?I?d join it for sure and you?d probably have at least 3 or 4 other members from ZED too.
?
Like you , we at ZED-UK believe that this assessment is going to be a good way to stand out from the crowd. 
?
My only slight concern is whether this is going to just be a matter of learning ASHRAE 90.1 etc inside out and then being tested on that or is it going to be a more in depth look at whether you know what the principles of building physics are? 
?
Can anyone give me a clue on this?
?
I have taught Building Physics and Computational Modelling both within academia and as a trainer for commercial software providers.? I try and teach some principles even within my short 3 day software courses as it?s imperative to do so, in order that people can get a grasp of why you do certain things in models, particularly in a low energy passive naturally ventilated building.? This sort of work seems to me to be partly contrary to ASHRAE regulations require and so I?m just wondering if my slightly lesser knowledge of exact types of systems will be a hindrance.? I know the fundamentals and general elements of most systems having served my apprenticeship as a BMS controls engineer, but I am not a complex system mechanical HVAC designer.? I am a physicist after all, that?s what my PhD is in.
?
The AM11 book, in my view although getting quite old now, is a really good guide in how to scope and carry out a simulation study.? It is however quite a bit out of date, particularly when you look at the tools it has used.? We?ve suggested a re-write to CIBSE a few times and I think it will happen at some point, but I think it?s going to take a while.

Brian,

There is talk of ASHRAE running a training course soon ? 
?
And well done to Dave, you must be one of the very few ASHRAE BEMP?s about !
?
Are there any people out there interested in forming a study group ? ?We have ASHRAE and IBPSA Forums on www.linkedin.com that would provide a home and allow all us to gather and share study material. ?
?
ASHRAE Fundamental seems to be a good starting point, but which chapters ? ?The 90.1 User Manual is the cornerstone ?? The books by Muneer and Moss are definatelly required reading anyway, but the Stein / Reynolds book is a slab of a book and may only help non-US people get up to speed with US terminology. 
?
I don?t have any of the CIBSA material yet ? how useful is the Applications Manual AM11: 1998, Building energy and environmental modeling ? ?It seems a little long in the teeth ?
?
The ASHRAE Standards are required for any LEED work anyway
?
For those of us outside the US, the ASHRAE BEMP and HBDP exams are an important opportunity to stand out in a world of ?dabblers?, and probably the only way to benchmark yourself against the international community.

Paul,
 
I do not remember there being any ASHRAE-specific questions on the exam.
It was oriented much more toward principles of building physics and
modeling. General knowledge of HVAC system types and control strategies
will be helpful, but you don't have to be an HVAC designer to pass. If
you're going to read any of the ASHRAE Fundamentals, I'd look at Chapter
19 - Energy Estimating and Modeling Methods. Several of the sections in
the chapter cover items listed in the Detailed Content Outline provided
by ASHRAE. (Warning: with apologies to the authors, Ch. 19 is very
technical and will put you to sleep trying to read it.) Also, there were
no software-specific questions, so I wouldn't be too concerned if your
references are starting to get old. One of the things I read was
"Guidelines for Energy Simulation of Commercial Buildings", from 1992,
and available here:
http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?query_id=0&page=0
&osti_id=5291948
 
I didn't have access to AM11 so I can't compare.
 
Regards,
Bill

Thanks Bill, much appreciated.

Pretty much all text books send me to sleep anyway but then I do have  
Narcolepsy.
I remember having to read that chapter and the ones on ventilation and  
infiltration. They too were fairly technical and hence almost  
automatically sent me to sleep.

Hi All,
          In one of project my basline building was having packaged syngle

Have you tried cycling your fans? If you'r doing this for ASHRAE compliance you need to do this anyway.

If there are more than one zone assigned to the PZS, then remove the
thermostats to the extra zones.  This happened to me when i attached an
unconditioned plenum space to a PZS space.

Message-ID: <B9A3AA6F98276B4EB15DECA51DB7F85101D7331F@smain07.IBECE07.local>

Has anyone modeled a nighttime radiation cooling system, where the water
is sprayed directly on the rooftop of the building, not through
tubing/flat plate collectors? If so, any ideas on how to model this in
TRNSYS/Excel?

 

Any information on the theoretical background would also help. I can
only seem to find information regarding closed systems.

Does anyone know what the workaround is to model a VRF system in EE4?

Did I read somewhere that a 4-pipe fan-coil system with zero fan-power is
workaround system type?

Where might I have read that?

Patrick,
  I would think that the correct way of going about it (in TRNSYS) would 
be to write a model of the wetted outermost layer of the roof to take 
into account the evaporation, convection, and radiation that occurs at 
all times (night or day) and then couple it to a BOUNDARY wall (that 
models the remaining roof layers) . We've used the concept in the past 
to model PCM wall materials and to model ground coupling.
Best,
 David

Yes. Only put the heating temp schedules and cooling temp schedules in the
zone you have selected as the Control Zone. If you use the Spreadsheet
option you will be able to do this easily. Use the drop down menu and select
Undefined for all other zones.

Siew Yik, 

If you are looking for benchmarks of energy use intensity, here are the 
ones for Singapore (Office, Hotel, Malls, Industrial facilities). You may 
take a look at EnergyStar for the US ones.

  Siew Yik,

  If you are looking for benchmarks of energy use intensity, here are the
ones for Singapore (Office, Hotel, Malls, Industrial facilities). You may
take a look at EnergyStar for the US ones.

Does anyone know how to create separate meters for tenant and Core and Shell
Energy in Energy Pro 5? I looked through the help files and couldn't find
it.

Is anyone familiar with the recent additional requirements set forth by
USGBC for C&S EAc1 with regard to Core and Shell and Tenant Energy use %'s?

I am not familiar with the Energy Pro 5 interface but the simulation 
engine is DOE2.1e.  You will likely have to modify the .inp files to 
add the separate meters.  The DOE2.1e Supplement has documentation 
and examples for adding meters.

Hi all, 

 

Does anyone know how to change the ventilation rates and/or supply fan power
for the reference building generated automatically by EE4 (DOE based)
software? I need to change the ventilation rate for my reference building to
match the proposed in order to meet the local code requirements. 

 

I appreciate any suggestion.

In EE4, the reference and proposed buildings always have the same OA
ventilation rates.  By setting the proposed building OA airflow, you are
by definition setting the reference building OA airflow values.

If you require different ventilation rates between proposed and reference
files (e.g. if you have high proposed building airchange rates in excess
of 120% of ASHRAE-62 and need lower values for the reference building per
old CBIP rules), you need to create a separate reference building run with
the different flow rates in the proposed building.

If you are looking at the proposed and reference buildings and are seeing
different OA airflow rate values in the SV-A reports between proposed and
reference then you almost certainly have a zonal type system with heat
recovery, where EE4 is derating the proposed building OA airflows as a
workaround to model the heat recovery.

Feel free to contact to discuss further.

Can anyone shed some insight on what type of service hot water heated is

All;
 
For LEED v2.2:  In individual office spaces, does overhead, locally-controlled lighting in each individual office meet the requirement to enable adjustment to suit the task needs and preferences if the control is only on/off?  If there is a window, one could argue that turning the lighting off and using the daylight through the window enables adjustment.  I have looked in the CIRs and haven't seen this exact question.  Thanks for your help.

That's good Yi.

It would be worthwhile hosting it on the Yahoo E+ support forum. There are a
couple of potentially useful utilities on there including a Ruby script that
will split your simulation period over the number of processors you have for
a multicore machine.

Very good!

Although EnergyPlus is now providing a number of functions (parametric, SQL
output etc) natively, I believe there is still much jEPlus can offer. I hope
turning it into a community project will help it grow. My special thanks to
Davis Marques, who has joined the project and was the reason that this
happened before Easter in the first place. I would like to welcome more
developers and users to join the project, too.

 

Best wishes,

 

Yi

Hello all,

I have a question about RESFEN that I'm hoping this list can help me get my head around. RESFEN is developed and maintained by LBNL and I believe runs off the DOE2 engine. The software is simple to use because of its limited inputs, however I want to change one of those restricted inputs.

I'm trying to change the boiler performance which I think I can do by editing the building description file (which RESFEN labels as a .d2 file). I've attached the file and saved it in a .txt format for all to see.

My question is: Can someone proficient in the DOE2 language help me decipher where and how to edit the efficiency of the boiler in the attached file? I don't know the part load, just that the boiler in question operates at 60% efficiency. If this is to broad a question please let me know and I will attempt to clarify.

Thanks in advance!
Alex Krickx

Alex,

With the caveat that I am not a programmer or a developer and with some
trepidation I will say I think I know where you should go at least. The
first part is a programming language, see above, but the last part looks
like DOE2 BDL. It is probably from DOE2.1e since it's from LBNL. So going
way back in the memory banks and scrolling down, down, and further down
there is something labeled:

##if #[Vintage[] eqs New ]
   FHIR=1.3550   CEIR=.3703
##elseif #[Vintage[] eqs Exist ]
   FHIR=1.5015   CEIR=.41667


I'm pretty sure that FHIR is what you want and if my memory serves, a big
if, it represents 1/eff so the first one, age New, would be 79.7%, and the
second one, age Exist, would be 66%. Since this kind of makes sense, I might
be right! If I'm not, hopefully someone who knows more will correct me.

Maybe you can verify this by changing it. I've never used RESFEN myself.

Let me know what happens.

Carol

Holly,

 

You can use an external file within a schedule to model say occupancy.  If
you had data that told you the level of occupancy for each room for each
hour of the day, etc then you can bring that file into the EnergyPlus model
within a schedule for occupancy and hence it would allow you to model it
exactly if necessary.  Then using the Parametric tools that E+ offers, you
could then change a variable at a time (that would be my preference, even
though you can do more than 1 at a time) to then work out the effects of
those variances and the link to occupancy and effectiveness, etc.

 

ESP-r will probably run faster than E+ which will be useful if your models
are large.  Both are difficult to work in.

 

Cheers

Paul

Holly,

In EnergyPlus, you could implement a model for the user behavior using
either the Energy Management System or the Building Controls Virtual Test
Bed. The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed would allow you to implement the
user behavior model either in MATLAB, Simulink, Modelica, Ptolemy or in your
custom program, and link it during run-time to EnergyPlus so they can
exchange data as the simulation progresses. It is available from
https://gaia.lbl.gov/bcvtb

All the best,

Michael Wetter

Hi Carol,

Thanks for your response. Looking through the user manual, RESFEN is based on DOE2.1e (nice call!)

Resfen has 2 options to choose from: Gas Furnace+AC  and Electric Heat Pump. From what I read online (http://windows.lbl.gov/software/resfen/faq/50_faq.htm#HVAC%20MODELING) RESFEN 5 does not model electric resistance heating, but rather models the buildings with a Furnace+AC system and then converts the energy consumption using expected heat pump performance to determine final electric consumption. I think what you came across is the conversion from the furnace system to the heat pump system. The website also takes into account the efficiency of the furnace as it reverse-engineers the expected heat pump consumption. The efficiencies are 70% for existing construction and 78% for new (which are similar to the numbers you came up with).

I may still be able to edit the piece of code that you describe but as I'm also neither a programmer or a developer it makes me a little nervous to do so.

In any case, thanks for your response and if I have any success I'll share it with the list.

Regards,
Alex Krickx

Alex,

With the caveat that I am not a programmer or a developer and with some trepidation I will say I think I know where you should go at least. The first part is a programming language, see above, but the last part looks like DOE2 BDL. It is probably from DOE2.1e since it's from LBNL. So going way back in the memory banks and scrolling down, down, and further down there is something labeled:

##if #[Vintage[] eqs New ]

   FHIR=1.3550   CEIR=.3703

##elseif #[Vintage[] eqs Exist ]

   FHIR=1.5015   CEIR=.41667

I'm pretty sure that FHIR is what you want and if my memory serves, a big if, it represents 1/eff so the first one, age New, would be 79.7%, and the second one, age Exist, would be 66%. Since this kind of makes sense, I might be right! If I'm not, hopefully someone who knows more will correct me.

Maybe you can verify this by changing it. I've never used RESFEN myself.

Let me know what happens.

Hello all,

I have a question about RESFEN that I'm hoping this list can help me get my head around. RESFEN is developed and maintained by LBNL and I believe runs off the DOE2 engine. The software is simple to use because of its limited inputs, however I want to change one of those restricted inputs.

I'm trying to change the boiler performance which I think I can do by editing the building description file (which RESFEN labels as a .d2 file). I've attached the file and saved it in a .txt format for all to see.

My question is: Can someone proficient in the DOE2 language help me decipher where and how to edit the efficiency of the boiler in the attached file? I don't know the part load, just that the boiler in question operates at 60% efficiency. If this is to broad a question please let me know and I will attempt to clarify.

Thanks in advance!

This is getting to be a good discussion.  On the ESP-r side there are many options for
getting complex patterns of occupancy, lights, equipment.  At one extreme you could
define for every minute of the year casual gains (occupants/lights/small power) for
one (or more) rooms in what we call a temporal file and read these in during the
simulation (or every 5 minutes or 10 minutes etc).

ESP-r has a (not-used-very-often) formal description of uncertainty so that you can
nominate portions of a model (e.g. the conductivity of brick on the south facade
or the size of a window) and say how uncertain you are about that and then direct
the simulation engine to run however many simulations are needed to explore the sensitivity
of predictions to changes in these parts of the model. There are a half dozen
formal statistical methods implemented so if you don't like a step-wise change you can use a
different approach.

What would be really nice would be to use a descriptive language that
implemented patterns of diversity overlayed onto the simplistic schedules that
most of us tend to use.  I think that SHOCC does this, but it
is a bit of a learning curve for practitioners.

Holly,

You can use an external file within a schedule to model say occupancy.  If you had data that told you the level of occupancy for each room for each hour of the day, etc then you can bring that file into the EnergyPlus model within a schedule for occupancy and hence it would allow you to model it exactly if necessary.  Then using the Parametric tools that E+ offers, you could then change a variable at a time (that would be my preference, even though you can do more than 1 at a time) to then work out the effects of those variances and the link to occupancy and effectiveness, etc.

ESP-r will probably run faster than E+ which will be useful if your models are large.  Both are difficult to work in.

Cheers
Paul

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ESPr vs. E+ for occupant behavior research

I am studying the impacts of occupant behavior on the success of various building technologies, such as natural ventilation, radiant ceilings, phase-change materials, automatic lighting controls, demand-controlled ventilation, etc. using whole building energy simulation.  I am wondering whether to use EnergyPlus or ESP-r.  An advantage of ESP-r seems to be the SHOCC module, which seems to offer a great deal of flexibility for manipulating occupant behavior, including stochastic processes.  However an advantage of EnergyPlus seems to be its extensive HVAC libraries so that I can actually model energy use instead of loads.  I am wondering if the EnergyPlus Runtime Language (ERL) (described in Ellis, Torcellini, Crawley 2007) would offer the opportunity for a similar level of occupancy control via simple programming.  I would appreciate any advice on the appropriateness of each software for this research.
Thanks in advance!

Hello all,

I've tried installing Equest 3.63b onto two different machines and am
getting the same error (when I click to open the program). Here is the error
below.

DOE2Com Initialization Error (On the top tab)

Error initializing BDLLib32.



This error shows up as soon as I click to open the program and pops up
before the equest browser pops up.

Anyone know where my mistake is? Thanks!

Holly,

If you look at the my occupancy behavior study in IBPSA2009 (I guess you
already looked), I used E+, using external input files.

At that time (early 2008), bcvtb is not mature to be implemented. However,
now I think BCVTB should be the most suitable one. It allows to interact E+
and MATLAB every timestep. I would program my occupancy algorithm in MATLAB
and interact with E+ through BCVTB.

If you have any questions on occupancy behavior, let me know.

Cheers,

Bing Dong

Neeraj,

 

An interesting application. Although I cannot help you with the piezoelectric devices you seek, I do know a very reliable manufacturer of whoopee cushions. If these could somehow be connected into a turbine generator system, then I?m sure you could generate an equivalent amount of power. Other benefits include:

?         With the deluxe ?auto inflating? range, the cushions would remove air from the room with every footfall ? energy free ventilation!

?         Whoopee cushion technology is tried and tested, having been developed over the last 80 years.

?         Zero ODP & GWP

?         Fun, and a possible lasting attraction encouraging users back to the building for years to come!

 

Best regards

 

Chris Yates

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Not a simulation question, but need help looking for vendor/ product developer for piezoelectric application / floor tiles.

 

Hello all,

We are exploring the feasibility of deploying a piezoelectric application in a large (approx. 2,00,000 sqft), 9 stories tall, public building coming up in India.
The building is being planned right now -- currently in the design development phase rolling fast towards final design and tendering stage(s). It is expected to see a very high foot fall on the ground and first floor levels and that's where I need further help. Is there a company available to design and sell an application or a product that will generate electricity -- perhaps using some sort of floor tiles?

Any of you who could help me may write to me directly since this is not a simulation question.

Thanks,
Neeraj

Neeraj,

 

I apologise for my response. I do not wish it to reflect in any way on the professionalism and help that this list endeavours to supply. I was out of order, sorry.

 

I seek to supply a more appropriate reply (and in doing so open myself to ridicule because there are probably a couple of mistakes in my working out!). Here goes:

 

The feasibility of a piezoelectric system implemented as floor tiles does seem to fly in the face of my understanding of Newton, Force and Work.

 

Average person has a mass of, say, 70kg.

 

Force exerted by both feet, therefore = mass x gravity = 70 x 9.81 = 686.7Newtons or 343 per foot

 

For the transfer of energy with every foot fall Work must be done to the tile. That means it must undertake some deflection. The resulting work transferred to the tile in Joules would be similar to the elastic potential energy equation: EPE = ? x kX2 

 

Let?s say the tile deflects 1mm under one foot. Therefore the spring constant k for the tile would be 343350N/m and EPE of the tile whilst stood on would be 0.172 Joules.

 

This is just EPE stored by the tile whilst loaded. The tile will probably consist of the piezo device and a substrate which the energy will dissipate over. Let?s be generous and assume 20% of that work is converted to electrical energy. We are now talking about 0.034 Joules per foot fall. The rest will escape as heat. Considering a human metabolism whilst walking will be of the order of 120 Watts plus (Watts = Joules / second) the energy recovered through floor tiles would be minimal.

 

I hope this is useful.

 

Chris

Neeraj,

 

An interesting application. Although I cannot help you with the piezoelectric devices you seek, I do know a very reliable manufacturer of whoopee cushions. If these could somehow be connected into a turbine generator system, then I?m sure you could generate an equivalent amount of power. Other benefits include:

?         With the deluxe ?auto inflating? range, the cushions would remove air from the room with every footfall ? energy free ventilation!

?         Whoopee cushion technology is tried and tested, having been developed over the last 80 years.

?         Zero ODP & GWP

?         Fun, and a possible lasting attraction encouraging users back to the building for years to come!

 

Best regards

 

Chris Yates

That's the point here:  developing new technology.  I may not be rational on floor tiles, but would be applicable elsewhere.  
The whoopie cushion idea brings up thoughts of places where energy is just dissipated by creating noise or heat:  Sitting down in a chair, spring return; automobile shock absorbers and springs; elevators going down (flywheels are sometimes implemented here); any kind of cyclical process where energy is 'used' to create potential energy or dissipate kinetic energy ... if the technology is developed and cheap, it could go anywhere.

  So then we should harness the elastic potential energy of vertical and horizontal building materials/elements on a highrise or any building where it's material deflect from wind pressure or other pressure.

  Is any company out there doing this now?

Message-ID: <EE3F700B3DD9D642BEA5D0B0A805C6121E6994B191@mail.hallam2000.com>

Hello,

When I begin an eQuest model in the Wizard entry mode and use a CAD file to "trace" my spaces I find that when I look at them in the detailed edit that they are not all bounded by walls.  Sometimes a core space will not have any walls or just one or two, but may not be fully bounded.  I find I end up going through and "bounding" all my spaces, to makes sure they have the correct layout of "interior" walls, "adiabatic" walls, "air" walls etc.  Could someone explain why some spaces are created with interior walls in the wizard and others are not?  As a follow up how are interior walls counted for in terms of thermal mass and by fully bounding spaces are internal walls double counted with regards to thermal mass?  I often use a "quick wall" or rather U-value input for light weight interior construction, but when I have a building with a lot of CMU walls internally I want to make sure I appropriately address the thermal storage properties.

Thanks for the help.

Joshua - I will take a stab at this. When you create your shell and then your spaces (zones), you may not have the space vertices correctly line up with your shell. Thus, the "exterior"wall does not know it is an exteroir wall, as it does reach the "outside."

Also you may have two adjacent space coordinates also not meshing correctly, thus you could have Space A's East interior wall actually being inside Space B's West region (Assuming Space A is on your left and Space B is on your right, and the Building North is actual north).

It can get fun trying to getting these spaces touching at the same coordinates, especailly if there are several votices per space.

Also, interior walls adjacent to another space are counted only once, and it could be in either space. This has been true in DOE-2 since it's inception.

Good luck.

Neeraj,

 

Pavegen Systems in the UK are in the process of commercialising such a
product: http://www.pavegensystems.com <http://www.pavegensystems.com/> 

 

There's no technical info on here though and, like Chris, I would be
pretty sceptical that the contribution from this would even register
against your overall building consumption. If you find out otherwise do
let us know!

 

Phil

Hello all,

We are exploring the feasibility of deploying a piezoelectric
application in a large (approx. 2,00,000 sqft), 9 stories tall, public
building coming up in India.
The building is being planned right now -- currently in the design
development phase rolling fast towards final design and tendering
stage(s). It is expected to see a very high foot fall on the ground and
first floor levels and that's where I need further help. Is there a
company available to design and sell an application or a product that
will generate electricity -- perhaps using some sort of floor tiles?

Any of you who could help me may write to me directly since this is not
a simulation question.

Thanks,
Neeraj

Ha, that is great.  Thank you, what a fine way to start a Monday.  Neeraj, if you are seriously looking into getting energy from people's fancy footwork I would suggest looking into the (nite) club's that are putting it in their dance floors.  You may be able to find a manufacturer.

Good looks, guys!  Before you know it we will all be nothing more than hamsters on a wheel.

Neeraj,

An interesting application. Although I cannot help you with the piezoelectric devices you seek, I do know a very reliable manufacturer of whoopee cushions. If these could somehow be connected into a turbine generator system, then I'm sure you could generate an equivalent amount of power. Other benefits include:

*         With the deluxe "auto inflating" range, the cushions would remove air from the room with every footfall - energy free ventilation!

*         Whoopee cushion technology is tried and tested, having been developed over the last 80 years.

*         Zero ODP & GWP

*         Fun, and a possible lasting attraction encouraging users back to the building for years to come!

Best regards

Hello all,

We are exploring the feasibility of deploying a piezoelectric application in a large (approx. 2,00,000 sqft), 9 stories tall, public building coming up in India.
The building is being planned right now -- currently in the design development phase rolling fast towards final design and tendering stage(s). It is expected to see a very high foot fall on the ground and first floor levels and that's where I need further help. Is there a company available to design and sell an application or a product that will generate electricity -- perhaps using some sort of floor tiles?

Any of you who could help me may write to me directly since this is not a simulation question.

Neeraj,

I apologise for my response. I do not wish it to reflect in any way on the professionalism and help that this list endeavours to supply. I was out of order, sorry.

I seek to supply a more appropriate reply (and in doing so open myself to ridicule because there are probably a couple of mistakes in my working out!). Here goes:

The feasibility of a piezoelectric system implemented as floor tiles does seem to fly in the face of my understanding of Newton, Force and Work.

Average person has a mass of, say, 70kg.

Force exerted by both feet, therefore = mass x gravity = 70 x 9.81 = 686.7Newtons or 343 per foot

For the transfer of energy with every foot fall Work must be done to the tile. That means it must undertake some deflection. The resulting work transferred to the tile in Joules would be similar to the elastic potential energy equation: EPE = ? x kX2

Let's say the tile deflects 1mm under one foot. Therefore the spring constant k for the tile would be 343350N/m and EPE of the tile whilst stood on would be 0.172 Joules.

This is just EPE stored by the tile whilst loaded. The tile will probably consist of the piezo device and a substrate which the energy will dissipate over. Let's be generous and assume 20% of that work is converted to electrical energy. We are now talking about 0.034 Joules per foot fall. The rest will escape as heat. Considering a human metabolism whilst walking will be of the order of 120 Watts plus (Watts = Joules / second) the energy recovered through floor tiles would be minimal.

I hope this is useful.

Chris

I once thought of opening a gym where each piece of equipment generated
electricity. (Bikes, stair masters, bench press).
 
I started by calculating the best case, the stationary bike.  

Long story short.  People are weak.  You save far more energy by turning off
the light.   

>From a web-site "http://blog.mapawatt.com/2009/07/19/bicycle-power-watts/"
"The current record holder for the Hour Record is Ondrej Sosenka and the
website BikeCult.com has an estimate of his average wattage during his Hour
Record at 430 Watts!  If Ondrej's bike were attached to a bicycle generator
and it was super efficient, Ondrej would have been generating enough power to
light up 7 60-Watt light bulbs!  Since I pay about 10 cents/kWh, if  I were
to pay Ondrej for the energy he produced over the hour he was pedaling he
would have almost  earned a whole nickel (430 Watts * 1 hour = 430 Watt-hours
= .43 kWh)!"

I don't see any way a dance floor could produce enough energy to power the a
couple of 1000 Watt speakers.

If it is feasible please send the information (as an engineer I'd like to see
the numbers.)

In building simulation, I would account for the heat a person produces, but
not the electricity.

Dear Chris,

 

Thanks for suggestions! You are quite right that the
"AnnualSimulationSplitter.rb
<http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/cDXDSwcz28zHkbGkF1pUsBWKlvUzNbygESu5TICqDF
P6SVd2I5_74slQv3_lr_OU4NI95YVeubt9QvGoQjQM3p2CFdlFY8A/Utilities/AnnualSi
mulationSplitter.rb> " (by Phylroy) is a wonderful idea. Maybe I should
consider incorporating the function in jEPlus so that the split results
can be merged in one CSV file. Has anyone tested how much error this
approach may cause, due to the discontinuity introduced into annual
simulation? I can imagine it would not be too bad if you don't split it
in tens of threads. 

 

Cheers,

 

Yi

That's good Yi.

It would be worthwhile hosting it on the Yahoo E+ support forum. There
are a couple of potentially useful utilities on there including a Ruby
script that will split your simulation period over the number of
processors you have for a multicore machine.

Very good!

Chris

Dear all,

 

I meant to send this yesterday but the clock ticked over midnight. I am
dead serious: jEPlus has gone open source (under GPLv3) and here is the
proof: http://sourceforge.net/projects/jeplus/

 

Although EnergyPlus is now providing a number of functions (parametric,
SQL output etc) natively, I believe there is still much jEPlus can
offer. I hope turning it into a community project will help it grow. My
special thanks to Davis Marques, who has joined the project and was the
reason that this happened before Easter in the first place. I would like
to welcome more developers and users to join the project, too.

 

Best wishes,

 

Yi

Kevin,

All I know with certainty at this point is that Dru Crawley, the program
manager for EnergyPlus, resigned from DOE to work elsewhere.

In the architectural world a competition is normally announced with the intention of awarding the project to the winning architect, so there is an incentive to spend the time doing this. At the risk of sounding materialistic - what does the winning analyst get?

Dear All,
I'm pleased to announce the 2010 Energy Analysis Competition, in association? with the IBPSA SimBuild 2010 conference in August. The energy analysis competition is open to both students and professionals. More information can be found on the competition website.
Good luck, and may the best analyst win!

Neeraj,

 

I apologise for my response. I do not wish it to reflect in any way on the professionalism and help that this list endeavours to supply. I was out of order, sorry.

 

I seek to supply a more appropriate reply (and in doing so open myself to ridicule because there are probably a couple of mistakes in my working out!). Here goes:

 

The feasibility of a piezoelectric system implemented as floor tiles does seem to fly in the face of my understanding of Newton, Force and Work.

 

Average person has a mass of, say, 70kg.

 

Force exerted by both feet, therefore = mass x gravity = 70 x 9.81 = 686.7Newtons or 343 per foot

 

For the transfer of energy with every foot fall Work must be done to the tile. That means it must undertake some deflection. The resulting work transferred to the tile in Joules would be similar to the elastic potential energy equation: EPE = ? x kX2 

 

Let's say the tile deflects 1mm under one foot. Therefore the spring constant k for the tile would be 343350N/m and EPE of the tile whilst stood on would be 0.172 Joules.

 

This is just EPE stored by the tile whilst loaded. The tile will probably consist of the piezo device and a substrate which the energy will dissipate over. Let's be generous and assume 20% of that work is converted to electrical energy. We are now talking about 0.034 Joules per foot fall. The rest will escape as heat. Considering a human metabolism whilst walking will be of the order of 120 Watts plus (Watts = Joules / second) the energy recovered through floor tiles would be minimal.

 

I hope this is useful.

An interesting application. Although I cannot help you with the piezoelectric devices you seek, I do know a very reliable manufacturer of whoopee cushions. If these could somehow be connected into a turbine generator system, then I'm sure you could generate an equivalent amount of power. Other benefits include:

Hello all,

We are exploring the feasibility of deploying a piezoelectric application in a large (approx. 2,00,000 sqft), 9 stories tall, public building coming up in India.
The building is being planned right now -- currently in the design development phase rolling fast towards final design and tendering stage(s). It is expected to see a very high foot fall on the ground and first floor levels and that's where I need further help. Is there a company available to design and sell an application or a product that will generate electricity -- perhaps using some sort of floor tiles?

Any of you who could help me may write to me directly since this is not a simulation question.

Thanks,
Neeraj

I just seem to remember that small issue that the Millennium Bridge in
London suffered from, harmonic resonance.  A series of these things mounted
down the pavement and everyone walking in unison, and before we know it,
pedestrians will be suffering from sick pavement syndrome.  Nice simulation
project, reckon that?s a real earner ;-)   Arup didn?t too badly out of the
Millennium Bridge situation, even though it was one of their own making.

The building is being planned right now -- currently in the design
development phase rolling fast towards final design and tendering stage(s).
It is expected to see a very high foot fall on the ground and first floor
levels and that's where I need further help. Is there a company available to
design and sell an application or a product that will generate electricity
-- perhaps using some sort of floor tiles?

Any of you who could help me may write to me directly since this is not a
simulation question.

Thanks,
Neeraj

Message-ID: <l2xcdf76d821004121124g5d971e05rc4bcd9ff45d958fd@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Is it possible to output a BSDF using Window 6, for a glazing without any
blinds/shades? I'm trying to do that for a Viracon glazing for use in
Radiance simulation but do not see the usual CSV and XML results files
Window 6 outputs for glazing with blinds/shades.

Thanks,

Alex -

 

Rather than trying to force RESFEN to model something that it is not
designed to do, I would suggest that you move to a more fully featured
simulation program.

Hi Carol,

 

Thanks for your response. Looking through the user manual, RESFEN is based
on DOE2.1e (nice call!) 

 

Resfen has 2 options to choose from: Gas Furnace+AC  and Electric Heat Pump.
>From what I read online
(http://windows.lbl.gov/software/resfen/faq/50_faq.htm#HVAC%20MODELING)
RESFEN 5 does not model electric resistance heating, but rather models the
buildings with a Furnace+AC system and then converts the energy consumption
using expected heat pump performance to determine final electric
consumption. I think what you came across is the conversion from the furnace
system to the heat pump system. The website also takes into account the
efficiency of the furnace as it reverse-engineers the expected heat pump
consumption. The efficiencies are 70% for existing construction and 78% for
new (which are similar to the numbers you came up with).

 

I may still be able to edit the piece of code that you describe but as I'm
also neither a programmer or a developer it makes me a little nervous to do
so.

 

In any case, thanks for your response and if I have any success I'll share
it with the list.

 

Regards,

Alex Krickx

Alex,

With the caveat that I am not a programmer or a developer and with some
trepidation I will say I think I know where you should go at least. The
first part is a programming language, see above, but the last part looks
like DOE2 BDL. It is probably from DOE2.1e since it's from LBNL. So going
way back in the memory banks and scrolling down, down, and further down
there is something labeled:

##if #[Vintage[] eqs New ]






   FHIR=1.3550   CEIR=.3703    






##elseif #[Vintage[] eqs Exist ]






   FHIR=1.5015   CEIR=.41667    


I'm pretty sure that FHIR is what you want and if my memory serves, a big
if, it represents 1/eff so the first one, age New, would be 79.7%, and the
second one, age Exist, would be 66%. Since this kind of makes sense, I might
be right! If I'm not, hopefully someone who knows more will correct me.

Maybe you can verify this by changing it. I've never used RESFEN myself.

Let me know what happens.

Carol

Hello all,

 

I have a question about RESFEN that I'm hoping this list can help me get my
head around. RESFEN is developed and maintained by LBNL and I believe runs
off the DOE2 engine. The software is simple to use because of its limited
inputs, however I want to change one of those restricted inputs.

 

I'm trying to change the boiler performance which I think I can do by
editing the building description file (which RESFEN labels as a .d2 file).
I've attached the file and saved it in a .txt format for all to see.

 

My question is: Can someone proficient in the DOE2 language help me decipher
where and how to edit the efficiency of the boiler in the attached file? I
don't know the part load, just that the boiler in question operates at 60%
efficiency. If this is to broad a question please let me know and I will
attempt to clarify.

 

Thanks in advance!

Hi,

Can anyone shed light on whether evaporative closed circuit cooling towers
are required to comply with table 6.8.1G of ASHRAE 90.1 2007?

This table shows the required heat rejection equipment performance in terms
of gpm per nameplate horsepower, but it seems to be more applicable to open
cooling towers. 

If the table is only for open towers, is there a separate requirement for
closed circuit evap coolers?

 

Sincerely,
Alec Stevens

Thank you Carol and Robin for your response. I wanted to know how far people had pushed the envelope in RESFEN.

With that said, what software do people use to model single family homes? I've used eQUEST for multi-family homes but not as often single family homes. What are people's thoughts on this?

Alex -

 

Energy 10 is a program that comes to mind for residential and small
commercial modeling, particularly if you are interested in modeling passive
solar features.

Thank you Carol and Robin for your response. I wanted to know how far people
had pushed the envelope in RESFEN.

 

With that said, what software do people use to model single family homes?
I've used eQUEST for multi-family homes but not as often single family
homes. What are people's thoughts on this?

 

Thanks!

Alex

Rather than trying to force RESFEN to model something that it is not
designed to do, I would suggest that you move to a more fully featured
simulation program.

Hi Carol,

 

Thanks for your response. Looking through the user manual, RESFEN is based
on DOE2.1e (nice call!) 

 

Resfen has 2 options to choose from: Gas Furnace+AC  and Electric Heat Pump.
>From what I read online
(http://windows.lbl.gov/software/resfen/faq/50_faq.htm#HVAC%20MODELING)
RESFEN 5 does not model electric resistance heating, but rather models the
buildings with a Furnace+AC system and then converts the energy consumption
using expected heat pump performance to determine final electric
consumption. I think what you came across is the conversion from the furnace
system to the heat pump system. The website also takes into account the
efficiency of the furnace as it reverse-engineers the expected heat pump
consumption. The efficiencies are 70% for existing construction and 78% for
new (which are similar to the numbers you came up with).

 

I may still be able to edit the piece of code that you describe but as I'm
also neither a programmer or a developer it makes me a little nervous to do
so.

 

In any case, thanks for your response and if I have any success I'll share
it with the list.

 

Regards,

Alex Krickx

Alex,

With the caveat that I am not a programmer or a developer and with some
trepidation I will say I think I know where you should go at least. The
first part is a programming language, see above, but the last part looks
like DOE2 BDL. It is probably from DOE2.1e since it's from LBNL. So going
way back in the memory banks and scrolling down, down, and further down
there is something labeled:

##if #[Vintage[] eqs New ]













 














 
   FHIR=1.3550   CEIR=.3703    













 














 
##elseif #[Vintage[] eqs Exist ]













 














 
   FHIR=1.5015   CEIR=.41667    


I'm pretty sure that FHIR is what you want and if my memory serves, a big
if, it represents 1/eff so the first one, age New, would be 79.7%, and the
second one, age Exist, would be 66%. Since this kind of makes sense, I might
be right! If I'm not, hopefully someone who knows more will correct me.

Maybe you can verify this by changing it. I've never used RESFEN myself.

Let me know what happens.

Carol

Hello all,

 

I have a question about RESFEN that I'm hoping this list can help me get my
head around. RESFEN is developed and maintained by LBNL and I believe runs
off the DOE2 engine. The software is simple to use because of its limited
inputs, however I want to change one of those restricted inputs.

 

I'm trying to change the boiler performance which I think I can do by
editing the building description file (which RESFEN labels as a .d2 file).
I've attached the file and saved it in a .txt format for all to see.

 

My question is: Can someone proficient in the DOE2 language help me decipher
where and how to edit the efficiency of the boiler in the attached file? I
don't know the part load, just that the boiler in question operates at 60%
efficiency. If this is to broad a question please let me know and I will
attempt to clarify.

 

Thanks in advance!

Seventeenth Symposium on
Improving Building Systems in Hot and Humid Climates
Call for Papers
AT&T Conference Center
Austin, Texas
August 24-26, 2010

Abstract deadline extended to: FRIDAY, APRIL 30, 2010
Co-hosted by
Energy Systems Laboratory
About the Abstracts

Technical papers are solicited for the 2010 Symposium on Improving Building Systems in Hot and Humid Climates to be held August 24-26, 2010. The Symposium will be held during 24-25 with the post-workshops on the 26th. The Symposium will be held in conjunction with the Clean Air Through Energy Efficiency 2010 Conference (CATEE). Together these create a unique blend of symposia dedicated to energy efficiency and clean air. The conference site will be the AT&T Conference Center located at the AT&T Conference Center on the University of Texas campus, Austin, Texas. This unique and premier conference focuses principally on building air conditioning performance in hot and humid climates. Attendees are upper level energy managers, building managers, architects, designers, consultants, utility representatives, code officials, equipment manufacturers and suppliers, consumers and researchers from around the world.
The purpose of the symposium is to accomplish technology transfer?from the laboratories of leading academic institutions, research organizations and industry; and from the best practices of practicing design and operations professionals?to the building industry at large. Identification of new equipment and processes is of major importance. However, the paper and presentation should be free of commercialism.

Authors wishing to present a paper for consideration must submit a 200-400 word abstract for each proposed paper no later than FRIDAY, APRIL 30, 2010 (electronic format required). All abstracts will be peer reviewed, and the acceptance based on content quality, originality and composition. A draft copy of an accepted paper must be received by Wednesday, June 16, 2010. The final corrected manuscripts must be received by Wednesday, August 4, 2010.

Papers are usually allotted 20-25 minutes for presentation, followed by a five-minute discussion. The presenter of each paper receives a reduced registration rate to the symposium which includes a copy of the proceedings and admission to all technical sessions.
Instructions for Abstracts
1. Abstracts should be 200 to 400 words in length.
2. Include one or more keywords from the list of topics.
3. Include title and all co-authors, address, phone number, fax number and email address.

John,

I'm assuming you are using ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Appendix G for your Baseline?
If so, the way I read it from Table G3.1 is that you should evenly distribute the WWR of the entire building, not for each floor. Therefore I would use 11.4% for each floor.

ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Table G3.1 reads:
"Vertical fenestration areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed design or 40% of gross above-grade wall area, whichever is smaller, and shall be distributed on each face of the building in the same proportions in the proposed design."

I wasn't aware that this requirement had changed in the 2007 version (thanks Cam!).

 I can't find this section in Table 1.3.? I just find the 40% limitation for
the baseline building. Can you post an excerpt?

John,

I'm assuming you are using ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Appendix G for your Baseline?
If so, the way I read it from Table G3.1 is that you should evenly distribute
the WWR of the entire building, not for each floor. Therefore I would use
11.4% for each floor.

I have a two story building.  For the baseline I am evenly distributing the
fenestration.

The first floor window area is 462.2 ft^2
The second floor window area is 647.1 ft^2

The first floor wall area is 4858 ft^2
The second floor wall area is 4858 ft^2

In the base line model do I use:

First floor 9.5%
Second floor 13.3%

OR

First floor 11.4%
Second floor 11.4%

Alec -

You're correct, the base standard did not include regulations for closed circuit cooling towers. This was clarified by "Addendum a" to the standard.

However, in early 2008 "Addendum l" added requirements for closed towers, which can be found at the ASHRAE website - http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/132

Hi,
Can anyone shed light on whether evaporative closed circuit cooling towers are required to comply with table 6.8.1G of ASHRAE 90.1 2007?
This table shows the required heat rejection equipment performance in terms of gpm per nameplate horsepower, but it seems to be more applicable to open cooling towers.
If the table is only for open towers, is there a separate requirement for closed circuit evap coolers?

Sincerely,
Alec Stevens

Interesting point. I've never noticed this before, but this is different from 2004. 
?
2004 stated :
?
Vertical fenestration areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed design or 40% of gross abovegrade wall area, whichever is smaller, and shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four orientations.
?
It looks like they have changed it (shall be distributed on each face of the building in the same proportions in the proposed design) to be more representative of the actualy building. I think 2007 is asking you to distibute it by orientation (if you have 40% on the west, 25% south, 20%north and 25% east in your design, you will have 40% on the west, 25% south, 20%north and 25% east in your baseline). This makes sense because otherwise we were doing the striping as well as the 4 rotations which was a little redndant. 
?
(Not so easy question after all, but a good one).

"Vertical fenestration areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed design or 40% of gross above-grade wall area, whichever is smaller, and shall be distributed on each face of the building in the same proportions in the proposed design."

I wasn't aware that this requirement had changed in the 2007 version (thanks Cam!).

For the 90.1-2004 I have always taken it as Luke explained, evenly distributed the WWR of the entire building.

However for 90.1-2007 I have interpreted the description to mean that the windows stay in the same location as the proposed building?

Perhaps I'm missing something, but didn't he ask us how to *calculate *the
window to wall ratio? If I'm not missing something, we need to know
specifically, is the wall number wall only or wall + glass. This level of
information is shown on the LV-D report in eQUEST, if he's using eQUEST.
That's why I said, "it depends".

All,

 

As per Addendum A to 90.1-2004, you do NOT need to distribute the baseline glazing uniformly in horizontal bands across the four orientations. ASHRAE 90.1-2007 is basically 90.1-2004 incorporating the changes made in Addendum A. All addenda can be found here: http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/132

 

If you read Table G3.1.5, it only states that the glass must not exceed 40% and must be distributed by the same proportions as the proposed building. Therefore, if you have a building with 50% WWR, you just have to reduce each window by 20%. This will still ensure that you have the same proportions (e.g. 20% of all of the glass on the north, 30% of all of the glass on the south, 40% of all of the glass on the east, and 10% of all of the glass on the west).

 

If your baseline WWR is less than 40%, then leave the window proportions, shapes, and sizes the same in the baseline and the proposed design.

 

This has all been well documented on the archives as well: http://lists.onebuilding.org/htdig.cgi/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2007-April/004077.html

Perhaps I'm missing something, but didn't he ask us how to calculate the window to wall ratio? If I'm not missing something, we need to know specifically, is the wall number wall only or wall + glass. This level of information is shown on the LV-D report in eQUEST, if he's using eQUEST. That's why I said, "it depends".

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Easy Question

 

Interesting point. I've never noticed this before, but this is different from 2004. 

 

2004 stated :

 

Vertical fenestration areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed design or 40% of gross abovegrade wall area, whichever is smaller, and shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four orientations.

 

It looks like they have changed it (shall be distributed on each face of the building in the same proportions in the proposed design) to be more representative of the actualy building. I think 2007 is asking you to distibute it by orientation (if you have 40% on the west, 25% south, 20%north and 25% east in your design, you will have 40% on the west, 25% south, 20%north and 25% east in your baseline). This makes sense because otherwise we were doing the striping as well as the 4 rotations which was a little redndant. 

 

(Not so easy question after all, but a good one).

Hi there,

For 90.1-2007 Table 6.5.3.1.1a & b, I am under the impression that "CFMs"
comes from the baseline energy model ... should "CFMd" also come from your
baseline model or should this be the actual proposed design flow through
each device?

Thank you,
Caroline

Easy Question; Ha, 

I did not specify which version I was using. 

I am on LEED V2.2 hence ASHRAE Standard 30.1-2004.

My question is about interpitation rather than programming but I am using
Trace 700.
(I am still looking for an completed Trace file for LEED so I can see an
example or somebody to offer a good argument to us E-quest so I can purpose
it to management.)

The answer I received to my first question (See below) seemed to be that the
windows are to be spread evenly over the entire building.  Every exterior
wall will have the same percent window area (up to the maximum of 40%)  Thank
you all for your interpretation.

Second Question:
 
I plan on modeling the mechanical room, vestibules and stair wells as heating
only. I am in climate zone 5B and according to 90.1-2004 Table 3.1 if the
heating output is less than 15btu/h*ft^2 but greater that 3.4btu/h*ft^2
according to 90.1-2004 section 3.2 definitions it is considered semiheated.

Should I spead the fenestration arcoss the walls of the semiheated spaces?
(I've come to terms with the fact that my server rooms will now have windows
in the baseline.) 



Original Question: (has been answered)
I have a two story building.  For the baseline I am evenly distributing the
fenestration.
	
	The first floor window area is 462.2 ft^2
	The second floor window area is 647.1 ft^2
	
	The first floor wall area is 4858 ft^2
	The second floor wall area is 4858 ft^2
	
	In the base line model do I use:
	
	First floor 9.5%
	Second floor 13.3%
	
	OR
	
	First floor 11.4%
	Second floor 11.4%

If you apply 'addendum a' to 90.1-2004, you don't have to distribute windows evenly across the fa?ade. There are a couple of additional changes in addendum a, including supply air temperature reset of 5 deg F (instead of the original 10 deg F) and a building area change to Table G3.1.1A that would also have to be applied since addenda are acceptable as long as they are applied in full.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Easy Question 2

Easy Question; Ha, 

I did not specify which version I was using. 

I am on LEED V2.2 hence ASHRAE Standard 30.1-2004.

My question is about interpitation rather than programming but I am using
Trace 700.
(I am still looking for an completed Trace file for LEED so I can see an
example or somebody to offer a good argument to us E-quest so I can purpose
it to management.)

The answer I received to my first question (See below) seemed to be that the
windows are to be spread evenly over the entire building.  Every exterior
wall will have the same percent window area (up to the maximum of 40%)  Thank
you all for your interpretation.

Second Question:
 
I plan on modeling the mechanical room, vestibules and stair wells as heating
only. I am in climate zone 5B and according to 90.1-2004 Table 3.1 if the
heating output is less than 15btu/h*ft^2 but greater that 3.4btu/h*ft^2
according to 90.1-2004 section 3.2 definitions it is considered semiheated.

Should I spead the fenestration arcoss the walls of the semiheated spaces?
(I've come to terms with the fact that my server rooms will now have windows
in the baseline.) 



Original Question: (has been answered)
I have a two story building.  For the baseline I am evenly distributing the
fenestration.
	
	The first floor window area is 462.2 ft^2
	The second floor window area is 647.1 ft^2
	
	The first floor wall area is 4858 ft^2
	The second floor wall area is 4858 ft^2
	
	In the base line model do I use:
	
	First floor 9.5%
	Second floor 13.3%
	
	OR
	
	First floor 11.4%
	Second floor 11.4%

Hi Carolyn,

I'll take a crack at this. I am in agreement with you that CFMs comes
from/is used for the baseline model. If you look at the Option 2 on Table
6.5.3.1a you will notice the variable designated as A. Right below the same
Table, A is defined. It includes CFMd, which is information you would only
have from a proposed design building. So, I would say instead: CFMs,
modified using an Option 2 formula, which take into consideration CFMd when
appropriate, is what you use for your proposed design.

Hope this makes sense. As always, I am open for correction.

Carol

Okay know it is clear, 

I think the 2007 way is the more correct one. Why should you make one zone
artificial worse and on better? (If you have different WWR in different
Zones)

All,

 

As per Addendum A to 90.1-2004, you do NOT need to distribute the baseline
glazing uniformly in horizontal bands across the four orientations. ASHRAE
90.1-2007 is basically 90.1-2004 incorporating the changes made in Addendum
A. All addenda can be found here: http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/132

 

If you read Table G3.1.5, it only states that the glass must not exceed 40%
and must be distributed by the same proportions as the proposed building.
Therefore, if you have a building with 50% WWR, you just have to reduce each
window by 20%. This will still ensure that you have the same proportions
(e.g. 20% of all of the glass on the north, 30% of all of the glass on the
south, 40% of all of the glass on the east, and 10% of all of the glass on
the west).

 

If your baseline WWR is less than 40%, then leave the window proportions,
shapes, and sizes the same in the baseline and the proposed design.

 

This has all been well documented on the archives as well:

Perhaps I'm missing something, but didn't he ask us how to calculate the
window to wall ratio? If I'm not missing something, we need to know
specifically, is the wall number wall only or wall + glass. This level of
information is shown on the LV-D report in eQUEST, if he's using eQUEST.
That's why I said, "it depends".

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Easy Question

 

Interesting point. I've never noticed this before, but this is different from
2004. 

 

2004 stated :

 

Vertical fenestration areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that
in the proposed design or 40% of gross abovegrade wall area, whichever is
smaller, and shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the
four orientations.

 

It looks like they have changed it (shall be distributed on each face of the
building in the same proportions in the proposed design) to be more
representative of the actualy building. I think 2007 is asking you to
distibute it by orientation (if you have 40% on the west, 25% south, 20%north
and 25% east in your design, you will have 40% on the west, 25% south,
20%north and 25% east in your baseline). This makes sense because otherwise
we were doing the striping as well as the 4 rotations which was a little
redndant. 

 

(Not so easy question after all, but a good one).

	John,
	
	I'm assuming you are using ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Appendix G for your
Baseline?
	If so, the way I read it from Table G3.1 is that you should evenly
distribute
	the WWR of the entire building, not for each floor. Therefore I would
use

Is maximum 40%WWR intended to apply to gross building or to principal
exposures?  Assume 4 exposures: 1: 30% wall (100% window), 2: 20% wall (0%
window), 3: 30% wall (0% window), 4: 20% wall (0% window).  Building WWR =
30%.  Would baseline window WWR match exposure 1 of design case at 100%WWR?
Prior to 2004 addendum #1, (equalized banding) would have modeled all
baseline walls at 30%, but now will match proportions of design case, even
if an exposure exceeds 40% - (and proportionally reduce all exposures only
if building WWR exceeds 40%)?

Good question. Appendix G says "40% of gross above-grade wall area" which leads me to believe that the 40% applies to the entire building WWR, not each exposure's WWR. Appendix G also says "shall be distributed on each face  of the building in the same proportions in the proposed design".

>From this I believe that the 40% WWR maximum applies to the entire building, while the proportion of the windows is the same for each exposure for both the proposed and the baseline.

Is maximum 40%WWR intended to apply to gross building or to principal exposures?  Assume 4 exposures: 1: 30% wall (100% window), 2: 20% wall (0% window), 3: 30% wall (0% window), 4: 20% wall (0% window).  Building WWR = 30%.  Would baseline window WWR match exposure 1 of design case at 100%WWR?  Prior to 2004 addendum #1, (equalized banding) would have modeled all baseline walls at 30%, but now will match proportions of design case, even if an exposure exceeds 40% - (and proportionally reduce all exposures only if building WWR exceeds 40%)?

All,

As per Addendum A to 90.1-2004, you do NOT need to distribute the baseline glazing uniformly in horizontal bands across the four orientations. ASHRAE 90.1-2007 is basically 90.1-2004 incorporating the changes made in Addendum A. All addenda can be found here: http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/132

If you read Table G3.1.5, it only states that the glass must not exceed 40% and must be distributed by the same proportions as the proposed building. Therefore, if you have a building with 50% WWR, you just have to reduce each window by 20%. This will still ensure that you have the same proportions (e.g. 20% of all of the glass on the north, 30% of all of the glass on the south, 40% of all of the glass on the east, and 10% of all of the glass on the west).

If your baseline WWR is less than 40%, then leave the window proportions, shapes, and sizes the same in the baseline and the proposed design.

This has all been well documented on the archives as well: http://lists.onebuilding.org/htdig.cgi/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2007-April/004077.html

Perhaps I'm missing something, but didn't he ask us how to calculate the window to wall ratio? If I'm not missing something, we need to know specifically, is the wall number wall only or wall + glass. This level of information is shown on the LV-D report in eQUEST, if he's using eQUEST. That's why I said, "it depends".

However for 90.1-2007 I have interpreted the description to mean that the windows stay in the same location as the proposed building?

Interesting point. I've never noticed this before, but this is different from 2004.

2004 stated :


Vertical fenestration areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed design or 40% of gross abovegrade wall area, whichever is smaller, and shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four orientations.


It looks like they have changed it (shall be distributed on each face of the building in the same proportions in the proposed design) to be more representative of the actualy building. I think 2007 is asking you to distibute it by orientation (if you have 40% on the west, 25% south, 20%north and 25% east in your design, you will have 40% on the west, 25% south, 20%north and 25% east in your baseline). This makes sense because otherwise we were doing the striping as well as the 4 rotations which was a little redndant.

(Not so easy question after all, but a good one).

John,

I'm assuming you are using ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Appendix G for your Baseline?
If so, the way I read it from Table G3.1 is that you should evenly distribute
the WWR of the entire building, not for each floor. Therefore I would use
11.4% for each floor.

Hello, 

Everybody. I have a few questions regarding my eQUEST model.
It is a building with several 'mutiple floor height' places. In the wizard, I selected zone as "multi_level space". Then I could define the "conditioned height" as the height I want. However, when I tried to do the same thing for my second "multiple floor height" space, the "conditioned height" did not show up. Then I cant tell eQUEST how tall of my mutiple space. Therefore, I selected "open to below". But the eQUEST still generated a floor in the space which is supposed to be open to below. 

I wonder what is the best way for me to build my building? Why the "muti_level space" and the "open to blow" did not work?

 

Thanks  a lot.

 

Lanfang

specular systems (glazing systems without shading devices)" and the program
will generate the XML and CSV files when you calculate a glazing system. I'm
not sure they will have the information you are looking for, but that is how
you get those files for a specular glazing system.

Subject: [Radiance-general] [Bldg-sim] BSDF for a glazing without
blinds/shades

 

Hello all,

Is it possible to output a BSDF using Window 6, for a glazing without any
blinds/shades? I'm trying to do that for a Viracon glazing for use in
Radiance simulation but do not see the usual CSV and XML results files
Window 6 outputs for glazing with blinds/shades.

Thanks,
Ramana Koti.

Hi All,
             What should be  U value for below grade walls for basline is it
1.14 btu/hrsqft2F. and how much should i consider absoptamce fro base line
below grade walls.

I look forward for your response.

Sambhav,

 

Don't have my copies of 90.1 handy.. but I think I can guide your questions - do ask again if I'm missing the mark.

 

1.       While your units look about right for a U-value (Btu/h?ft2??F), baseline underground walls, in 90.1-2004, are defined with a C-factor, not a U-factor.  Appendix A section for underground walls explains how it's different from U-factor (I think C basically excludes air films), and has a table you can reference to find a C-value from chapter 5. Between that table and the relevant appendix A text section, you can build a custom construction to match the C-value specified.

2.       I don't think there's any specific guidance regarding wall/floor/partition construction absorptance values in 90.1.  It's one of those things that fall generally into "match the proposed."  90.1 does specify "solar reflectances" for roofs only, and we handle those (somewhat indirectly) through the absorptance inputs for roof constructions.

 

Hope this helps,

 

~Nick

Good morning Gentlemen,

 

Actually, the C-factor for below grade walls is the value of conductance for a given thickness of material and is basically the inverse of an R-value for a given thickness  i.e. R=1/C.  For the concrete in a below grade (BG)  wall, the overall C in the baseline BG wall should be 1.140 - see Table 4 in Chapter 26 of 2009 ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook.

 

The wall assembly in the software should include the exterior soil, the concrete (with total C=1.140), and the interior airfilm.

 

I hope this helps.  Have a nice day.

Hi Sambav,

If it's a below grade wall absorptance should not be a factor since the term
absorptance refers to the ability of a body to absorb light. Unless light is
somehow striking your underground wall absorptance should not be an issue.
eQUEST will know this, I'm sure.

Jacob,

 

After you input the first three vertices and click "done" you should get
a "polygon properties" dialogue box that will allow you to enter the
rest.  If not then you can double-click on the polygon in the component
tree and edit them from there.  By the way, you can avoid the annoying
y-vertex pop-ups on vertices 4+ if you enter all of the y-coordinates
first and then fill in all of the x-coordinates.

 

Best regards,

 

Mike

I am modeling a 1000 sf single family dwelling for the Solar Decathlon, a net zero home design competition.
I would like to maximize the accuracy of the model. Does it make sense to zone each room individually so I can precisely assign activity areas?
Or should I just zone the whole house as single family residential and let eQUEST figure that out?

I've done this before and I'll tell you the best thing you can do is get comfortable with editing the .inp file and do your custom polygon from there.

You can go to the "Building Shell" tab, right click on the screen, select "switch to polygon view" and edit any new polygons you have made in there.  However, this rarely works out for me because if you model is too complicated it hangs and then crashes a lot.  I would suggest drawing the polygons you want to edit in autoCAD, finding the points you want to make, and then putting them into the .inp file.

Jacob,

I have found performance of passive solar houses to be particularly sensitive to zoning choices.  If you "over-zone" your house, you'll find that the direct gain areas overheat even if the other zones are cool, unless you properly distribute the energy using mechanical or natural circulation.  For 1000 SF, I would consider going with two zones.  One for the direct gain zone, and one for non-direct gain zone, depending on the interior layout.  For houses of that size with minimal glazing one zone would probably be enough.  My belief is that unless you truly know how the air flows between zones, you're not gaining anything by using an excessive number of zones.  Also, you might consider using a simulation tool that accurately models thermal mass using the finite difference method.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] zoning for a small single family dwelling



I am modeling a 1000 sf single family dwelling for the Solar Decathlon, a net zero home design competition.
I would like to maximize the accuracy of the model. Does it make sense to zone each room individually so I can precisely assign activity areas?
Or should I just zone the whole house as single family residential and let eQUEST figure that out?
 
thanks,

I would echo Liam's suggestions with some additional thoughts...

 

eQuest is powerful and flexible, but one thing it doesn't particularly
excel at is modeling airflow between zones.  You can certainly build an
accurate model for a small residential project with 1 zone, and
over-zoning will only make it a more difficult task.  

 

However, unless you have a pretty fancy HVAC system in mind, you're
probably talking mechanically about a single-zone system anyway
(1-thermostat)...  

 

That said, even with 1 zone you can still define individual spaces
grouped under a zone if you wish to.  You can "connect" two or more such
spaces thermally (as with say an open kitchen/dining/living space) by
redefining their partition walls as "air" instead of frame walls (and
maintaining the space relationships) in the detailed mode, post-wizards.
I may be misunderstanding, but I don't think going crazy with spaces
will cause you any serious headaches if you're mindful to tie open
spaces together (remembering many residential doorways stay open 90% of
the time).

 

Understanding the solar decathalon is a college-level competition, I'll
stick my neck out and make the brash assumption that you might be fairly
new to energy modeling in general (please forgive me if this is out of
line)!  Some potentially useful advice to that end may include a few of
these "wish I knew this when I started" items:

*         The best/most accurate/time efficient energy models result
from good communication between all designers/disciplines involved.
That's between the energy modeler and each other.  It's your job to stay
abreast of everyone's progress.  

*         Ask questions!

*         Energy modeling to assist with optimizing design elements can
happen at various stages of building design - but take care to stay
mindful of the order of design.  At a "preconceptual" level, you might
hammer out various building envelope massing/orientation/glazing/shading
layouts for rough comparative results (eQuest may not be the most
time-efficient tool for this... suggesting Sketchup + IES-VE plugin for
a free option) - doing so, you and all parties need to intimately
understand there will be a good deal of inaccuracy in such models, and
that's okay for their purpose.

*         It's more productive to shift optimizing design elements such
as HVAC control elements, load balancing through thermal massing
options, and daylight harvesting nuances to a later stage of design.
Before such systems are laid out, you have little capacity to obtain
results accurate enough to be meaningful to the final design.

*         The phrase "comparative results" is a much more
practical/manageable goal than "accurate results" during early design
phases.  Seek to make apples-to-apples comparisons to guide the design
decisions in the right direction, not to provide the final answers.  

*         Sleep, 3 meals a day and regular exercise go a long way.

*         Subscribe to bldg-sim and equest-users and bookmark the
corresponding archive search pages - these are fantastic resources for
learning and exploring.

*         Saving your progress more often than is necessary is much
better than the alternative.  Save excessively and in separate
directories.  Really.

*         Otherwise simple energy modeling tasks can become VERY hard
when the design team is not on the same page regarding the end-goals.
"Saving Energy" is something everyone can agree to... but is your metric
in dollars, EUI, % improvement, tons of CO2 and/or carbon footprint?
Leaving such end-goal priorities unanswered can create major friction,
so address this early!

*         If you pursue energy modeling seriously, you will inevitably
and necessarily learn a heck of a lot and fast.  Never however assume
you're the smartest head in the room - you can always learn and grow
from others' perspectives if you keep your eyes and ears open.

 

Hope some of this helps, best of luck!

 

~Nick

Hi

I'm in the process of building an eQuest model to compare to an AHRAE
one. 

According to the ASHRAE guidelines, windows must be distributed evenly
along each of the four sides of the building.  Our building is a complex
structure, with very different heating zones.  (We have  a large garage
that will not be heated/cooled to the same temperature as the adjacent
office space).

It seems like we will gain an advantage when comparing our proposed
design to the ASHRAE one, by putting windows in an area that won't be
heated as much.  Has anyone encountered a similar situation?  How did
you deal with it?

 

Thank you,

Katherine,

 

There was a very lengthy discussion this week (perhaps misleading
entitled "easy question") on this topic which I think will completely
answer your question if you'll plug through it.  I've copied it below as
it's not yet in the archives ;).

 

I personally choose to always use the actual window layout in both
models as a matter of time-efficiency (you have to plug it in once
anyway), provided the overall glazing percentage is less than 40%.

 

Without taking any sides, I'll share my general perspective - disregard
it if you wish: In my experience, time invested in more accurately
modeling system/envelope behaviors generally tends to yield better
baseline performances.  Taking the alternative approach of exploiting
the more hazily written passages of 90.1 to yield similar performance
improvements may be harder to justify later on.

Good question. Appendix G says "40% of gross above-grade wall area" which leads me to believe that the 40% applies to the entire building WWR, not each exposure's WWR. Appendix G also says "shall be distributed on each face  of the building in the same proportions in the proposed design".

Is maximum 40%WWR intended to apply to gross building or to principal exposures?  Assume 4 exposures: 1: 30% wall (100% window), 2: 20% wall (0% window), 3: 30% wall (0% window), 4: 20% wall (0% window).  Building WWR = 30%.  Would baseline window WWR match exposure 1 of design case at 100%WWR?  Prior to 2004 addendum #1, (equalized banding) would have modeled all baseline walls at 30%, but now will match proportions of design case, even if an exposure exceeds 40% - (and proportionally reduce all exposures only if building WWR exceeds 40%)?

All,

 

As per Addendum A to 90.1-2004, you do NOT need to distribute the baseline glazing uniformly in horizontal bands across the four orientations. ASHRAE 90.1-2007 is basically 90.1-2004 incorporating the changes made in Addendum A. All addenda can be found here: http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/132

 

If you read Table G3.1.5, it only states that the glass must not exceed 40% and must be distributed by the same proportions as the proposed building. Therefore, if you have a building with 50% WWR, you just have to reduce each window by 20%. This will still ensure that you have the same proportions (e.g. 20% of all of the glass on the north, 30% of all of the glass on the south, 40% of all of the glass on the east, and 10% of all of the glass on the west).

 

If your baseline WWR is less than 40%, then leave the window proportions, shapes, and sizes the same in the baseline and the proposed design.

 

This has all been well documented on the archives as well: http://lists.onebuilding.org/htdig.cgi/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2007-April/004077.html

Perhaps I'm missing something, but didn't he ask us how to calculate the window to wall ratio? If I'm not missing something, we need to know specifically, is the wall number wall only or wall + glass. This level of information is shown on the LV-D report in eQUEST, if he's using eQUEST. That's why I said, "it depends".

Interesting point. I've never noticed this before, but this is different from 2004. 

 

2004 stated :

 

Vertical fenestration areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed design or 40% of gross abovegrade wall area, whichever is smaller, and shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four orientations.

 

It looks like they have changed it (shall be distributed on each face of the building in the same proportions in the proposed design) to be more representative of the actualy building. I think 2007 is asking you to distibute it by orientation (if you have 40% on the west, 25% south, 20%north and 25% east in your design, you will have 40% on the west, 25% south, 20%north and 25% east in your baseline). This makes sense because otherwise we were doing the striping as well as the 4 rotations which was a little redndant. 

 

(Not so easy question after all, but a good one).

John,

I'm assuming you are using ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Appendix G for your Baseline?
If so, the way I read it from Table G3.1 is that you should evenly distribute
the WWR of the entire building, not for each floor. Therefore I would use
11.4% for each floor.

If you're going to be using eQuest for LEED certification, I recommend you purchase ASHRAE Standard 90.1 and the corresponding Users Manual. The Users Manual will be an important reference.

Message-ID: <353464.31599.qm@web53305.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi all;

I am building an eQUEST model for an international net-zero home design competition, and I am trying to maximize accuracy. Does it make sense to zone each room individually, and manually characterize the behavior of all the appliances (they will be high efficiency)? Or should I just zone the whole house?as a single-family dwelling and consider eQUEST's default loads to?be close enough? The concern is that a lot of special appliances will be used and it seems like eQUEST's defaults might?be inaccurate.

thanks,
Jacob

Varkie,

Thank you for your very well composed thoughts on the use of energy
programs. I agree that improving the design process and architectural
and engineering integration is critical to reducing design costs while
still proving energy code and LEED compliance. 

The one point of disagreement with your argument is on the final page
where you state, "There is presently no group of forum of any kind
representing AEDs. Every group (IBPSA, IAI, ASHRAE energy research and
computer committees, etc.) are dominated by academia and research
institutions."

People from AED firms have been involved in IBPSA and ASHRAE for many
years across all disciplines.  While many research and academic
institutions are involved with these organizations, AED firms have
always been a part of the discussion and will have increased involvement
as energy use in buildings and related carbon emissions become more
important to reducing the built environment's impact on the natural
environment.  As you point out, communication and knowledge sharing
between the design community and research/academic community is the
logical next step. In many cases this is already happening, particularly
on the residential side, but maybe what we need is a conduit for
connecting these two groups on a larger scale.

Just my two cents. Again thank you for your thoughts.

Sam

Good Afternoon Jacob,

For maximum accuracy I recommend taking a room by room approach and specifically inputing as much information as you have about appliances, equipment, occupancy, lights etc...  eQuest defaults are great... but they are just that a default.

Good Luck.

Hi all;

I am building an eQUEST model for an international net-zero home design competition, and I am trying to maximize accuracy. Does it make sense to zone each room individually, and manually characterize the behavior of all the appliances (they will be high efficiency)? Or should I just zone the whole house?as a single-family dwelling and consider eQUEST's default loads to?be close enough? The concern is that a lot of special appliances will be used and it seems like eQUEST's defaults might?be inaccurate.

thanks,
Jacob

Varkie,

Thank you for your very well composed thoughts on the use of energy
programs. I agree that improving the design process and architectural
and engineering integration is critical to reducing design costs while
still proving energy code and LEED compliance.

The one point of disagreement with your argument is on the final page
where you state, "There is presently no group of forum of any kind
representing AEDs. Every group (IBPSA, IAI, ASHRAE energy research and
computer committees, etc.) are dominated by academia and research
institutions."

People from AED firms have been involved in IBPSA and ASHRAE for many
years across all disciplines.  While many research and academic
institutions are involved with these organizations, AED firms have
always been a part of the discussion and will have increased involvement
as energy use in buildings and related carbon emissions become more
important to reducing the built environment's impact on the natural
environment.  As you point out, communication and knowledge sharing
between the design community and research/academic community is the
logical next step. In many cases this is already happening, particularly
on the residential side, but maybe what we need is a conduit for
connecting these two groups on a larger scale.

Just my two cents. Again thank you for your thoughts.

Sam

Hello,
Does anyone know how to enter custom weather data into the .epw weather files that Energy Plus uses? I'm using DesignBuilder to run Energy Plus for a research project on solar greenhouse assisted biogas digesters. I originally modelled the greenhouse using a WYEC2 file, but I want to put in recent data for solar radiation and outdoor air temperature obtained from the test period so that I can assess the accuracy of the model. (I tried downloading recent weather data from the energy plus website but that didn't work).
Thanks for the help!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] White Box Technologies announces the establishment	of a Center for Open Source Building Simulations

Varkie,
 
Thank you for your very well composed thoughts on the use of energy
programs. I agree that improving the design process and architectural
and engineering integration is critical to reducing design costs while
still proving energy code and LEED compliance. 
 
The one point of disagreement with your argument is on the final page
where you state, "There is presently no group of forum of any kind
representing AEDs. Every group (IBPSA, IAI, ASHRAE energy research and
computer committees, etc.) are dominated by academia and research
institutions."
 
People from AED firms have been involved in IBPSA and ASHRAE for many
years across all disciplines.  While many research and academic
institutions are involved with these organizations, AED firms have
always been a part of the discussion and will have increased involvement
as energy use in buildings and related carbon emissions become more
important to reducing the built environment's impact on the natural
environment.  As you point out, communication and knowledge sharing
between the design community and research/academic community is the
logical next step. In many cases this is already happening, particularly
on the residential side, but maybe what we need is a conduit for
connecting these two groups on a larger scale.
 
Just my two cents. Again thank you for your thoughts.
 
Sam

Joe:
 
 
What would be the source of funding for the  Center for Open Source
Building Energy Simulations (COSBES) ?  A non-profit organization of
architectural engineering design firms (AEDs) could support this effort
since they are the main users of such programs. There isn't one.
 
DOE21E should be supported, maintained and enhanced by USDOE and LBNL
until AEDs accept Energy-Plus as the replacement program for DOE21E.
Several private firms have developed easy to use forms and graphics
interfaces to DOE21E.  If USDOE and LBNL were to abandon DOE21E, then
these private firms will lose their investment.  Either USDOE continues
developing and maintaining DOE21E, or it should compensate the private
firms for their losses.
 
Attached are my views on energy programs including suggested
enhancements to DOE21E.  The attachments have been omitted because of
their size.

Hayes,

You can first export the epw weather file to excel and change the values in
it. You can then use the "Weather Statistics and Conversion" utility tool
from EnergyPlus  to convert the excel file to the epw format..


Hope this helps..

Dear All,

This one appears to be an international bug across a range of softwares. I
co-authored a paper for the Australian & New Zealand Architectural Science
Association (ANZAScA) in 2009 discussing a range of problems experienced in
assessing the environmental rating of a small house in Launceston,
Australia. The matter of the number and type of zones became a key area of
concern in the thermal simulation of the design.

Dear All,

 

I have spent the last five years attempting to empirically validate the
Australian HER Software "AccuRate". This has included;

- the design & construction of three stand alone test cell buildings (6m x
6m), 

- the design & installation of environmental measuring systems,

- the collection, collation and cleaning of data

- The detailed simulation of the test buildings accounting for actual
climate data, measured infiltration rates, framing factor, internal heat
loads, external shading, etc

- six months of statistical analysis to try and assess the differences
between simulation and actual measurements.  

- a soon to be commenced conclusion

 

Just wandering if there is anyone else out there that has been through this
process, who I might be able to confidentially discuss some of the issue
with. 

Thanks

	per ASHRAE 55
Message-ID: <4A015401026CF44ABCC4D2A6A467AA1829FB93@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I'm modeling the renovation of a religious facility for the purpose of
complying with EAc1.  Half of the building is housing, half is
classroom-type space.  The current occupants are extremely accommodating
to varying indoor air temperatures, mostly in the housing portion of the
building.

 

If I read ASHRAE 55-2004 Section 2.3 correctly, you ONLY have to comply
with requirements of the standard if it is an indoor space designed for
human occupancy for periods of not less than 15 minutes.

 

Therefore, in your opinion, if I was trying to comply with both EAc1 and
the ASHRAE 55-2004 credit, would I be wrong if I set the heating and
cooling setpoints for the corridors, storage areas, bathrooms, lobbies,
etc to something like 55 degrees and 85 degrees respectively?  Can
anyone see anything wrong with this?

 

The main reason for asking is that the Owner wants to maintain the
existing 2-pipe system.  If I was modeling this with standard 72/75
setpoint temps, I would have WAY too many unmet load hours.

 

And a follow up question is this:  ASHRAE 55 lists the acceptable indoor
air conditions for OCCUPIED spaces, and in general, depending on indoor
humidity levels, the acceptable temperatures range from 68-82 degrees.

 

Is there ANYWHERE in 90.1-2004 / Appendix G where it says you HAVE to
comply with ASHRAE 55?

 

If we were attempting the ASHRAE 55 credit (EQc7.1), obviously we would
have to, but if we didn't, and were only shooting for EAc1, what
prevents me from setting classrooms to 55 degrees heating and 85 degrees
cooling?  I understand that this is clearly not an ideal thermal
environment, but if the Owner of the building WANTS to run a 2-pipe
system to these temperatures, does LEED-NC v2.2 or 90.1 prevent this?

 

Thanks in advance!

Message-ID: <4A015401026CF44ABCC4D2A6A467AA1829FBA6@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I think I asked this question a year ago or so, but wanted to see if
anyone had an update on this, as I believe there may have been a recent
CIR that addresses this issue (that I can't seem to find).

 

I'm modeling a building that is fed by an electric service that is
mostly demand based.  The building Owner has decided to use gas-fired
fuel cells in conjunction with natural gas generators to reduce demand
via peak shaving.  

 

Someone mentioned that this might be a no-no as it relates to Appendix G
- that I would need to model the fuel cells and natural gas generators
in the baseline building as well.

 

Does this make sense, and has anyone seen a CIR that confirms this?

 

The client is using fuel cells to reduce emissions, reduce the peak
demand seen by the utility company (thereby reducing their use of
inefficient diesel generators), etc...it doesn't seem fair not to award
a project that wants to do this.

 

Anyone have any input?

A few people asked for me to post what I found on this issue, and here
it is.  Still not 100%, but it *looks* like you can't take credit for
gas-fired fuel cells in EAc1.  As much as they may help with emissions,
electrical power infrastructure, and reduction of time-of-use utility
charges, I think the best you can do is apply for an ID credit (which is
a shame).

 

Although this CIR is from NC v2.1 (before Appendix G even existed), and
although the two paragraphs of the response sort of contradict each
other, it appears that they do NOT allow peak shaving to be accounted
for in EAc1.  I'm not sure whether to model the fuel cells in both the
baseline and proposed, or completely remove them from both...

 

(ID credit under LEED-NC v2.1)

 

5/24/2004 - 

Ruling
The use of a generator for peak shaving is a legitimate energy cost
saving and capacity reduction measure. Identical rate schedules must be
used in both the proposed and budget buildings for energy modeling (see
EAc1.5 CIR Ruling dated 3/24/04). Note that using a time-of-use (TOU)
rate will only capture a portion of the potential benefits to the
project and the environment under EAc1, since the budget building must
also use the TOU rate for modeling purposes.

The peak shaving use of the generator does not count under EAc1. Since
the use of a generator to shave peak demand is not a regulated component
of ASHRAE 90.1, any savings/environmental benefits could qualify as an
innovation credit. Be sure to quantify the benefits. Claims of emission
reductions need to be based on comparison to a reasonable baseline in
your region. Claims made on dollar savings alone should be equal to at
least 5% of the total building energy use (see previous IDc1.1 CIR
Rulings dated 4/17/03 and 8/16/02).

 

 

Would love to be proved wrong!

Subject: Natural Gas generation of electricity as it relates to EAc1

 

I think I asked this question a year ago or so, but wanted to see if
anyone had an update on this, as I believe there may have been a recent
CIR that addresses this issue (that I can't seem to find).

 

I'm modeling a building that is fed by an electric service that is
mostly demand based.  The building Owner has decided to use gas-fired
fuel cells in conjunction with natural gas generators to reduce demand
via peak shaving.  

 

Someone mentioned that this might be a no-no as it relates to Appendix G
- that I would need to model the fuel cells and natural gas generators
in the baseline building as well.

 

Does this make sense, and has anyone seen a CIR that confirms this?

 

The client is using fuel cells to reduce emissions, reduce the peak
demand seen by the utility company (thereby reducing their use of
inefficient diesel generators), etc...it doesn't seem fair not to award
a project that wants to do this.

 

Anyone have any input?

James,
 
I would model the fuel cells in the proposed design only, and leave it
out of the baseline. The LEED Reference Guide for Green Building Design
and Construction (for LEED 2009) describes how to handle CHP systems in
EAc1. You may or may not be using the fuel cells for heat but I think
you could argue it is a similar situation. "The baseline building's
heating and cooling plant utilizes the backup energy source of the
design, or electricity if no backup source is present or specified. When
all electricity and thermal outputs (heating or cooling) of the CHP are
used within the design building, the electricity produced is considered
free, as is the produced thermal energy. The input fuel for the CHP and
any additional purchased energy is charged to the design building."

Bill

Message-ID: <BF1F81AEAA45B54399BF46028C53D59401CA5D43@SV04005.rmf.com>

Hello All,

 

For the majority of the LEED projects I work on I decouple the space
load from the ventilation load by using a dedicated outdoor air unit
(DAOU). Before GBCI took over the review process the proposed and
baseline models contained the same number of systems meaning if we used
a DOAU in the proposed model  - we modeled the same unit in the
baseline. I recently received a comment to remove the DOAU from the
baseline and add the ventilation air to the space load systems. For that
particular model it didn't have a very big impact so I didn't think
twice about it.

 

The question - should a DOAU be modeled in the baseline case or should
the outdoor air load be added to the mechanical systems that take care
of the space load?

 

Thanks

I agree to leave out the DOAS in the baseline case.  The baseline case needs
to be in accordance with either Section 11 or Appendix G of 90.1, neither
sections requires a DOAS for the baseline building.

Hello All,

 

For the majority of the LEED projects I work on I decouple the space load
from the ventilation load by using a dedicated outdoor air unit (DAOU).
Before GBCI took over the review process the proposed and baseline models
contained the same number of systems meaning if we used a DOAU in the
proposed model  - we modeled the same unit in the baseline. I recently
received a comment to remove the DOAU from the baseline and add the
ventilation air to the space load systems. For that particular model it
didn't have a very big impact so I didn't think twice about it.

 

The question - should a DOAU be modeled in the baseline case or should the
outdoor air load be added to the mechanical systems that take care of the
space load?

 

Thanks

Its an interesting problem because if the DAOU is 
a system has over 5000 cfm and over 70% OA the 
baseline system requires heat recovery 
(G3.1.2.10).  I know because I asked the question 
of ASHRAE as an Interpretation Request.  Even 
though the individual systems served by the DAOU 
have less than 70% OA, the baseline systems still 
require heat recovery of at least 50% effectiveness.

RMI is gathering and developing tools to support improved methods and
quality energy modeling. RMI plans to deliver these open source tools to the
modeling community in late summer (delivery mechanism still to be worked
out). As part of this, we will be developing a spreadsheet-based tool to be

1) provide side-by-side input variable values for completing parametric runs
2) provide side-by-side output results values for easily comparing
parametric run results
3) compare metrics calculated from run output to expected rules-of-thumb

4) provide standard graphs of results for reports and presentations

If anyone is aware of open-source tools that address some or all of these
capabilities, please let us know. We may be able to use them as a starting

I've included an example of what the plots do. The colored plots are the DOE-2 class, the black and white plots are the old LoanSTAR plots the ESL developed using SAS, TEK, etc.

How can I determine how much energy an elevator consumes? I know the power
the elevator needs if it is in operation. But how can I estimate how many

Any suggestions?

I have another problem calculating loads


How can I determine how much energy an elevator consumes? I know the power

times a day the elevator operates? 

Any suggestions?

Hello Luke,

Try with ASHRAE Fundamentals 2005 , Ch 30. Look for Internal heat gains for
appliances.
If there is no specific info for washer & drier, pick similar appliances and
use the data for your calculations.
Hope this helps.
Best, Sasa

Hello all, happy Friday.

 

I have a model that has a commercial grade washer and dryer in a space. I
have no equipment information. Can anyone give me some heat load estimates
for these types of equipment? It doesn't have to be perfect, I just need to
account for some heat load.

 

I appreciate your help,

While the 90.1 User's Manual does provide schedules, it does not tell you
what the average maximum power demand is.  Getting power demand information
from elevator vendors is, well, tricky.  The best approach could be to
determine the motor size of the elevator and apply a loading factor to it.
What is a good loading factor?  Good question - how about 50%?  Does anyone
else have any suggestions on this?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] EnergyPlus Version 5.0 available
Message-ID: <20100426183311.54FE34800D@diego.dreamhost.com>

EnergyPlus Version 5.0 Available

The latest release of the EnergyPlus building 
energy simulation program, Version 5.0, is now 
available in versions for Windows, Linux, and Mac 
operating systems. A few key new features 
include: enhancements to EMS applications, new 
application guides, Wind Turbine, External 
Interface, Zone Ventilation for Wind and Stack 
Open Area.  We have updated and extended 
capabilities throughout the existing building 
envelope, daylighting, and HVAC equipment and systems portions of the program.

EnergyPlus V 5.0 is available at no cost from the 
EnergyPlus web site:  www.energyplus.gov.

OpenStudio plugin for Google SketchUp: The 
OpenStudio is a free plugin for the 
GoogleSketchUp 3D drawing program. The plugin 
makes it easy to create and edit the building 
geometry in your EnergyPlus input files. The 
plugin also allows you to launch EnergyPlus 
simulations and view the results without leaving SketchUp.

EnergyPlus Example File Generator: A Web-based 
service is available that creates and runs 
EnergyPlus input files for simple models of 
commercial buildings. The input files (and annual 
results summary files) are sent to your e-mail 
address as attachments. This is a pilot project 
and is currently made available only as a BETA 
service. You can access the service and customize 
the characteristics of the building you want to 
model on the EnergyPlus Example File Generator 
Application (pop-ups must be enabled).

The set of example input files now includes 
full-blown models of typical new construction 
(drawn from the DOE Commercial Benchmarks project).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Fan Power Calculation Clarification
Message-ID: <o2y69a9bc0a1004261407x3e7f0c7aj313de58e778aef@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have seen some discussion on how to separate fan power from EER on the
various list-serves, but never seen an explicit description of exactly how
to go about it.  Below are my calculation methodologies and I'm hoping to
generate some thumbs up/thumbs down discussion and clarification:

>From ASHRAE 90.1 Users manual formula G-A:

EER = (Net Cooling [BTU/h]) / (Total Input Power [W])

     = ((Gross Cooling - Supply Fan Power) [Btu/h]) / (Total Input Power
[W])

Definitions

Total Input Power:  Includes supply and condenser fan power, and condenser
power

Supply Fan Power [btu h ] : this is the heat rejected by the fan to the
supply air stream.  If 100% of the fan power is eventually converted to
heat, then this is 3,413 X Supply Fan KW.


To Calculate the EER, minus the fan, do the following:

Break Total Input Power into Supply Fan Power and condenser fan and
compressor power

I'll use the following abbreviations for subsequent formulas to minimize
typing:

GC : Gross Cooling [btu/h]
SPb: Supply Fan Power [btu/h]
SPw: Supply Fan Power [w]
CP: Compressor Power [w]

For an Appendix G baseline model, we have GC, SPb, SPw, and EER.  So, from
formula G-A, we solve for CP::

CP + SPw = (GC - SPb) / EER

CP = (GC - SPb) / EER - SPw

Now, we can determine the EER, excluding the fan power so:

Modified EER = GC / CP

A few things to discuss:

1.  Is this really appropriate for systems where the fan power is calculated
using the G.3.1.2.9 guidelines?

2.  What is done when the requirements for cooling system efficiency is
listed as a SEER instead of an EER?  Is there an acceptable conversion
factor for use in these calculations?

3.  I this methodology what is intended?  ASHRAE Appendix G, and even the
User's Manual is extremely brief of this.

Thanks,

--
Karen

Ellen,

 From 2006-2007, I worked on a project for the California Energy 
Commission to compare DOE-2.1E to EnergyPlus for the Commission's
Title-24 suite of certification runs. My basic strategy for the project 
was to modify DOE-2.1E into a translator to EnergyPlus. Because of 
funding constraints, doe2ep (which is what I ended up calling the 
program) converts 98% of DOE-2 LOADS (all except daylighting) and
roughly 60-70% of DOE-2 SYSTEMS and PLANT (all system types used in
the certification suite, e.g., PSZ, PVAVS, VAVS, but not the older
or more esoteric system-types). The attached paper from SimBuild06 
summarizes my experiences with translating from DOE-2 to EnergyPlus.
It's not always possible to find a one-to-one correspondence of the 
inputs. Although one wishes that the two programs give similar results, 
my own experiences indicate they may diverge significantly for more 
transient effects, such as start-up loads or thermal mass 
charge/discharge under floating temperature conditions.A thorough 
comparison between the two program would help to clarify the differences 
  between them in terms of the results.

A little on the status of doe2ep. After I left LBNL, it took about a 
year to get permission to continue development work on doe2ep, but I 
have yet to get started for various reasons. My hopes are to finish
doe2ep, i.e., produce a full translation of any DOE-2.1E input file,
upgrade it to the current version of EnergyPlus (doe2ep now produced 
Version 1.4 files), and eventually release it as open source software.

Hi Karen,

How are you?? Well, I trust. I will look at your calcs as soon as I can but
I must go watch the PORTLAND TRAILBLAZERS (go BLAZERS!!) win! I hope!! The
game is starting right now.

Sorry in advance to any/all Suns fans (just kidding). You know the
Trailblazers are all we have here in Portland and we are FANS!

Carol!!

	Requirements
Message-ID: <024001cae615$d0f68900$72e39b00$@com>

I want to ask if there are countries that require to include the influence
of the external environment for the energy simulation performance of a
building in a Building Energy Rating system.

By external environment I mean surrounding buildings, trees, etc.

If there are such requirements can you tell (and give reference) what they
are? For instance: Which buildings? How far you take the surroundings from
the building? Etc.

 

Will appreciate your answers.

 

Best,

-A.

	efficiency
Message-ID: <F72AFAB7A1A6C8418C87519EB7EF6AD90249BABA@stgt-ms-ex2.dreso.int>

Hello All!

 

I'm working on a Whole Building Simulation according 90.1-2004 for a C&S
Project. We use heating energy from a district heating network. Heat is
generated by about 20 different plants which feed the network. Some plants
are heating only, but the majority are cogeneration plants. 

We would like to apply for points in Step 2 (Required Treatment of District
Thermal Energy) but we cannot verify the annual efficiency of the plants.  

 

#####

CHP Calculation Methodology for LEED-NC v2.2 EA Credit 1:

 

1. The minimum annual CHP system efficiency must be at least 60%. Efficiency
is expressed by the following equation:

Annual CHP Efficiency = (Annual Btu electrical output of the fuel-driven
electricity

generator + Annual Btu Thermal Product) / Annual Btu fuel input (Lower
Heating Value of input fuel)

#####

 

Is there a way to apply for points using a default annual efficiency? Sth.
like described in "Required Treatment of District Thermal Energy" on page 7
and 8?

 

Any other ideas?

 

 

Best regards 

 

Johannes.

Thanks,

 

found the attachment, which says, that in normal office-building (Europe, 8
stops) an average of 200000 cycles will occur. I calculated the annual energy
demand as follows:

 

Q = Number of cycles * Total Power * Total Height of Building * 40% (average
distance per cycle) / Speed = [-] * [kW] * [m] * [-] * [m/s] = kWs ...8760
h/year etc..

While the 90.1 User's Manual does provide schedules, it does not tell you
what the average maximum power demand is.  Getting power demand information
from elevator vendors is, well, tricky.  The best approach could be to
determine the motor size of the elevator and apply a loading factor to it.
What is a good loading factor?  Good question - how about 50%?  Does anyone
else have any suggestions on this?

How can I determine how much energy an elevator consumes? I know the power

Hello Luke,

Try with ASHRAE Fundamentals 2005 , Ch 30. Look for Internal heat gains for
appliances.
If there is no specific info for washer & drier, pick similar appliances and
use the data for your calculations.
Hope this helps.
Best, Sasa

Hello all, happy Friday.

 

I have a model that has a commercial grade washer and dryer in a space. I
have no equipment information. Can anyone give me some heat load estimates
for these types of equipment? It doesn't have to be perfect, I just need to
account for some heat load.

 

I appreciate your help,

My intention was more on the negative aspects of the shading rather than in
the positive influence of it.

Suppose that you have a south fa?ade. The building will perform better with
the fa?ade exposed to the sun but the performance will change completely if
the fa?ade is in shade in winter time. Hence my question: There are
requirements on this regard? If so , what are they?

I don't know of any that REQUIRE it.  LEED is the most popular bldg rating
system in the USA.  They ALLOW you to take credit for external shading from
permanent features (example: another building or self shading from a portion
of your own bldg) in the proposed building model.  The baseline building
model that you are comparing yourself to does not get to take credit for
external shading.

So I would think you have to use the DES paper and you can apply the defaults which are very low compared to ASH 90.1-2004 base.

But I think it only supersedes if there is a conflict. The requirement
"annual CHP eff" is only in the CHP calc. Methodology, not in the "Required
Treatment of District.."-document. 

In another project the leedreviewteam didn?t accept our solution. So I think
you must prove the annual efficiency.

 

In my project I get 6 points in step 1 and 13 (theoretical points) in Step 2.
It?s C&S 2.0 so the maximum is 10 points. So without CHP it is not too bad,
but it would be easy points..

Message-ID: <6B717D4C6A431A4999E8441F2B85FE620307D987@ch-kemaexch3.kemaus.com>

Hi all, 

I was wondering if anyone could help me out on an issue I have been
seeing with oversizing in eQUEST. 

I have been using eQUEST 3.63 to model commercial benchmark buildings. A
majority of them I have been just modeling in the Wizard mode and using
the EEM wizard to investigate different energy efficiency measures. Some
building types have been converted into the Detailed mode as I was
looking at more complicated systems/measures. 

In the wizard mode the only oversizing factor I have applied is in the
HVAC supply fan screen. I left this screen as default - that is
'autosize' the flow which has a 1.15 ratio set as default. 
I am then applying my own oversizing factor for the cooling and heating
capacities to the eQUEST 8760 results in a post-processing spreadsheet. 
However, when I converted some of the building models to Detailed
Interface I saw some discrepancies with the oversizing occur depending
on the HVAC system type. 
Under the 'Air-side Systems' - Basic Specifications there is a Sizing
Ratio listed there. For building types with Packaged DX Heat Pump
systems installed the value listed for this column is '1.15'. I expected
this was directly the 1.15 factor that was entered for the supply air
flow in the Wizard mode. However, for Packaged DX furnace systems, the
value under the Sizing Ratio column is '1.00'. Why has this changed if a
ratio of 1.15 for the supply air flow was specified in the fan screen of
the Wizard? 
In DOE2 the definition of SIZING RATIO is 'Multiplier on the
program-calculated values of air flow rate and coil size'. SIZING-RATIO
does not modify the heating/cooling loads calculated in LOADS. It
modifies the secondary equipment sizes only, not the primary equipment
sizes.'
How is this multiplier applied to each of those systems (i.e is it just
the supply airflow or does it include coil too?). What is secondary
equipment? Is an example the auxiliary heating I am seeing for a heat
pump system? 
I would really appreciate any clarity you can provide on this issue as
it will affect whether I can apply our own oversizing factor in our
post-processing. 
Thank you for your time.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] On-site gas fired generation (fuel cell) update
Message-ID: <4A015401026CF44ABCC4D2A6A467AA1829FC4E@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I sent out an email a few weeks ago about whether people thought we
could use an on-site gas-fired fuel cell in EAc1 (reduces utility
company demand, lowers emissions, etc).

 

Although we haven't submitted our project this way, nor have we
submitted a CIR, I just noticed at the end of the CHP Methodology
publication that the following requirements exist:

 

CHP System Qualifications 

 

The intent of this guidance protocol is not to grant performance
advantages under EAc1 to 

large-scale utilities, but rather to support and reward the
implementation of smaller scale 

CHP installations. Consequently the CHP system must meet the following
criteria in order 

to be eligible for consideration under EAc1. 

 

1. The minimum annual CHP system efficiency must be at least 60%.
Efficiency is 

expressed by the following equation: 

 

Annual CHP Efficiency = (Annual Btu electrical output of the fuel-driven
electricity 

generator + Annual Btu Thermal Product) / Annual Btu fuel input (Lower
Heating Value of 

input fuel) 

 

2. The environmental performance of district CHP systems must be
validated by a 

narrative addressing emissions and showing that the environmental impact
of the system 

is lower than if the building heating requirements were met with a
natural gas boiler and 

the cooling requirements with electric chillers using electricity
provided from the local grid. 

 

3. The Design Building must still meet EA Prerequisite 2 without the
benefit of CHP.

 

In other words, unless we are recovering heat from fuel cells, natural
gas generators, etc, and the total system efficiency is 60%, we CANNOT
take credit for them in EAc1.

 

Sucks, but I guess there's a valid reason for this (someone could
install a big inefficient diesel generator to shave peak demand, and get
away with lower performing building materials, HVAC systems, etc).

 

Just wanted to forward this information to everyone.

Hi Nick,

I'm glad you raised this issue.

First, I agree with James, and have heard from other people, that LEED
accepts documentation saying something as basic as "hey, I don't have 25%
plug loads".

Second, when you have to create a baseline to measure up from, you are
forced to say what that baseline is. For instance, in 1985-86, working on
the BPA-funded Energy Edge project, we had to figure out the baseline for a
group of buildings being designed to exceed the current energy codes by 30%.
We didn't have a baseline then. To deal with this we assembled a group of
people that we euphemistically called The Greybeards (so sorry to you all).
The tables now known as G3.1.1A & G3.1.1B in Standard 90 came out of what we
created in that moment of time. We were trying to limit what is called
"gaming the system"

So now it seems it has been deemed important to control the baseline a
little more: by specifying plug loads at 25%. The goal of trying to limit
gaming the system might be the source of the 25%. The danger which Nick has
clearly demonstrated in his email is that what is meant to control gaming
the system, may now actually be creating it.

Further thoughts/comments welcome,

Carol

Firstly, apologies for the cross-posting, but it appears this topic has
grown include many lists so I can't come up with an alternative!

 

Secondly, a huge thanks to Carol, James and a large number of others
(who shall remain unnamed until they should decide to join the public
discussion) who have given me direct input on their personal thoughts,
outside of the mailing lists.

 

I have received a flood of suggestions regarding approaches when the
intent is to follow the 25% rule, and additionally regarding how one
might go about appeasing a USGBC LEED model reviewer when attempting to
document a lower figure.  My impression up until this point, based on
colleagues' experience/advice, has been that attempting to substantiate
anything less than 25% process loads would be a futile task and would be
flatly rejected.  As a result I never really considered this to be an
option available to us LEED energy modelers.  I now understand that for
many, documenting something less than 25% has proven a feasible, if
occasionally exhaustive, task.

 

When the intent is to follow the 25% baseline process load prescriptive
requirement, I have been exposed (again outside of the lists) to a
surprising number of unique viewpoints and seemingly legitimate
approaches which have led to successfully reviewed LEED model
submissions for others.

 

Among the approaches to build the process loads to 25% are:

-          Adding a single direct internal/external load to the project
electrical meter in addition to the designed space equipment loads -
this approach avoids additional internal heat gains.

-          Adding additional or redefining designed space equipment
loads, adding internal heat sources.  If and when these additional loads
should result in too many unmet cooling hours in the proposed model,
there are two basic approaches:

o   Specify larger system cooling capacities and/or airflows

o   Allow those systems cooling capacities/airflows to auto-size

-          Keeping the designed space equipment loads without adding any
further, but modifying their utilization schedules to increase space
equipment usage during non-peak cooling hours - this of course adds heat
to the models, but avoids unmet cooling hours due to clashes with
proposed system cooling capacities.

 

I sincerely hope Carol and others will not misunderstand... Myself and
others do not wish to "game the system," but we seem to have a variety
of viewpoints as to what the intent is for the 25% rule.  

 

If it may help and add to the discussion, my personal opinion leading up
to this inquiry has been that the default 25% rule exists simultaneously
as a means of normalizing the "difficulty level" of attaining LEED EAc1
points for projects with various actual process loads.  Perhaps at some
point in time, somebody decided it would be unfair for someone designing
a LEED Platinum toolshed with zero process loads to have an easier time
of it than some poor sucker trying to get some EAc1 credits for an
automotive manufacturing facility with immense process loads?

 

I will unfortunately be unable to participate in or respond to this
topic of discussion for some time as I will be away from my inbox.  I
very much look forward to gaining a better understanding of how we as a
group might come to agree on a "best practice" for this issue.  If
anyone should currently have access to a relevant CIR that would
probably be very useful.

 

A humble thanks again to everyone,

 

~Nick

	For example, the Receptacle Power Density for the Office

	If using that value results in the process loads being less than
25%, my comment to the reviewers would be that the 0.75 watts/SF is the
value determined by ASHRAE to be appropriate for the building type.

	 

	I think the most important thing is to use something reasonable
and defendable, and make it the same between the Baseline and Proposed
Design energy models.  Our experience indicates that it does not have to
be exactly 25%, can be less than 25% or greater than 25%, depending on
the building.

	 

	One thing that is interesting is that on federal projects, per
EPACT requirements, you do not have to factor in the process/recep loads
for the purpose of determining whether the 30% savings requirement has
been met.  That makes it easier to show 30% savings.

	Something new occurred to me this week and I'd love to hear
others' thoughts!

	 

	LEED prescribes baseline/proposed energy models to follow ASHRAE
90.1 with a caveat:  the "process energy costs" must total 25% of the
baseline energy costs.  By extension, 90.1 requires the same
loads/schedules be applied to the proposed model as they have to match.
As an aside, the LEED EAc1 templates appear to calculate/check this
using process energy consumption (not cost), but that's not what I'm
getting at...

	 

	I just had a typical case where I had to inflate the baseline
internal miscellaneous equipment loads to get to 25%.  These additional
loads were substantial enough that when applied to the proposed
model/design, I ran into many unmet cooling hours for the equipment
capacities entered.  

	 

	Then I realized:  We can define additional equipment electricity
loads but simultaneously apply a multiplier (in eQuest anyway - I expect
this is feasible other programs also) to reduce/negate the corresponding
heat load contributions.  This results in the energy consumption/costs
showing up correctly in the final results/reports, but does not
artificially inflate the internal loads that the baseline/proposed
systems must handle.

	 

	Would this practice (which incidentally can be a time saver) of
accounting for extra process/miscellaneous loads without extra thermal
contributions be in line with the intent of ASHRAE/USGBC?  It would
still normalize the otherwise unstandardized process consumption/costs
of the baseline/proposed models between different building types...

	 

	On the other hand, if it really is the intent of USGBC to add
arbitrary additional internal heat loads to our models that our actual
designs were not designed and sized for, does it follow that we should
allow the proposed models to autosize cooling equipment/fan capacities
and not specify them (this would seem incongruous with 90.1 to me)?

My apologies also for cross-posting. Bldg-rate does not know me and I simply
do not have time to correct that right now.

First, please, please all of you, keep this sort of discussion on line where
it needs to be! I can't imagine why it would go offline for any other reason
except for two: people are afraid they might say something *wrong, or people
are afraid someone or some organization might in some way get back at
them.*I, for one, refuse to live like that. It's possible that every
one of you is
smarter than me, but I think we all make mistakes and have concerns. So be
it.

Second, wow it's a day of lists for me, I no longer have to worry about
gaming the system in that I am no longer a project engineer. I am very clear
that I do not ever intentionally do it myself on any of my projects. I meet
the technical requirements that are placed before me with as much integrity
as possible.

As do all of you.

Please speak up and don't be afraid of anyone or any organization.

Personal regards to all of you,

Carol
