Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Modeling interior surface absorptance
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200106260808.AA085682md80000058520@gard.com>

It appears in DOE2.1e that only the exterior surface absorptance can be
specified.  Is there a way to model changes in the absorptance of the
interior surfaces to re-radiate more heat back into the room?

Many thanks.

I am using Micro-DOE2 from Acrosoft International.
The SIM program requires user to press a key after finishing.
Does one of you know of a means to end this program 
without having to press e key (a switch option like /w for example) ?

Dear all,

A presentation of the SimCad CAD software for building simulation
will be held at the department of architecture at the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee, in collaboration with CSTB, France,

on Wednesday, August 1st 2001.

The SimCad tool as well as the TRNSYS package will be presented
in the morning. In the afternoon, participants who wish to do so
have the opportunity to try out the tools in an exercise session.

The goal of this meeting is to present the concept of SimCad to
interested architects, consultants and researchers, but also to discuss
how this type of tool could evolve to better fit the needs of
practitioners.

This meeting is free of charge. (Lunch is not included.)


If you are interested, please contact Mike Utzinger

Defining a chiller size and E-I-R in DOE-2.1EJohn,
As far as I know, the nominal capacity and EIR numbers are as you say - 100% load, 44/85.  

The default curves for modifying the capacity and EIR as functions of CHW and CW temperature will return a value of 1.00 at 44 and 85.  What DOE does is use the hourly values for CHW and CW temp and then multiplies the nominal EIR and capacity by the results of the other formulae.  For example, if you are modeling CW reset, and your CW temp goes down in the spring or fall, then the vaule of the EIR f(CHW, CW) formula will return less than 1 in these conditions, and the value of capacity f (CHW, CW) will be greater than 1.  

If you are modeling a system where CHW temp is always 44 and CW temp is always 85, then you don't need to mess around with the formulae that are based on CHW and CW temp.  However, I would use actual mfgr data for the chiller performance as a function of PLR, especially if you are modeling a rotary screw chiller or a chiller with a VFD.  

If you are modeling CHW and CW temps other than 44/85, I would also get mfgr data on the chiller performance at other points and use the data to create new coefficients for the curves.  I recently did a job where we were modeling a rotary chiller as the base case and a VFD-driven centrifugal with CW reset and 48 F CHW along with free cooling in the winter as the proposed case.  So I created and debugged all kinds of curves and coefficients for that job.  

If you would like any more info on creating new curves, I can give you some tips on that - let me know.

I would also be interested in hearing what others in the group have to say on this topic - if you can forward me any other responses you have gotten, I would appreciate it.

Sincerely,

Alec Stevens

  I don't currently have a DOE-2 Engineering Document, so this question is posed to the DOE "gods and gurus": 

  There are three curves that modify the (capacity)/(part load ratio)/(electric input ratio) in DOE-2 (or PowerDOE or eQuest) of a chiller (let's use a hermetic centrifugal chiller for this example).  Within PLANT, there is a place to insert a "nominal capacity" and an "electric input ratio".

  The question is, whatever I put into these input slots represent what? ARI conditions? 100% design? 

  And then the three curves modify these vs. load, entering condenser water, and exiting chilled water. So the 100% point is what (full load, 44 DegF CHW leaving, and 85 DegF Condens.water entering?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] User Friendly (was: Building Simulation in the U.S.)
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200106130752.AA523385pd80000054983@gard.com>

Lets not forget that the team of design engineers and 
architects working on the design of a building knows as 
much as anyone could know about how the building is 
supposed to work.  Through drawing and specifications, they 
have a created a model of how the components work and 
interact that can be turned into a working building in 
order to serve the needs of the occupants.  The complex and 
rich expression of how a building is supposed to be 
simulated is already present just in the wrong language.  
Allowing easy expression of this type of complexity in a 
building simulation program therefore is "simply" a user 
interface issue.  It is solvable.  My suggested general 
rule to follow: 

  The closer to the design team's way of expressing the  
  design the better.  

That said, the current state of the art in building energy 
simulation programs are not very close to the way engineers 
do express designs.  

For example, a schematic design with all flows between 
equipment and a sequence of operations for the sensors and 
controls is what is often used in practice.  Why isn't the 
building energy simulation software input more like that?  
In part, because in the past, the input requirements are 
driven by the algorithmic approach of the software.  This 
needs to be reversed to achieve "friendly" software - the 
algorithms need to be driven by the input requirements.  

Thermal blocks (a.k.a zoning) are another big issue, the 
level of abstraction needed to understand what a good 
thermal block plan would be for a simulation program 
requires an understanding of the simulation algorithm.  Why 
should a design engineer care?  Assuming that all surfaces 
are imported from a CAD program (a big assumption) and each 
zone is associated with a type of occupancy, why can't the 
simulation program find out the best way to break up the 
building into thermal blocks.  Someone could come up with 
an algorithm to do this.  

Another issue is libraries of materials and equipment.  It 
is in the best interest of the manufacturers of products to 
supply enough information for building energy simulation 
programs but they don't. What are the barriers here? 

a) Different types of information needed by each software 
program.  

b) Possible incorrect interpretation of data by the user or 
the software.  

c) Not a large enough market to bother with supporting 
those customers.  

d) Not enough specifying engineers asking for the data. 

The last point brings us back to why are simulation 
programs not used more.  One way to start solving these 
programs is to look at all the standards used to specify 
the different products and make sure the simulation 
programs accept the standard performance metrics as direct 
inputs.  DOE-2 cannot accept AFUE or EER.  Also product 
specifications should be examined for common methods of 
expressing performance and control of equipment and 
components.

What is left of the problem?  The unique domain of 
knowledge about the building simulation program itself.  
This is new knowledge that the engineer doesn't need 
normally to fulfill his responsibilities and thus it needs 
to be minimized.  Can it be?  I think so, the typical space 
loads and schedules for operation for occupation are easy 
lookup's in a library.  Engineers do that all the time when 
the specify building components.  Select a weather file - 
again easy.  The problem is all of these other inputs: 

ground reflectance, 
fraction of heat to space, 
weighting factor, 
infiltration coefficient, 
maximum glare, 
inside visible reflectance, 
convergence tolerances, etc..  

Any of these types of inputs require a engineer to learn 
new stuff.  I think most can be avoided completely, 
specified as part of a building component, or expressed 
differently in terms the engineer can appreciate.  

In summary, I assert that the almost all of the needed 
details of the building energy simulation are known by the 
design team of a building but they don't use building 
energy simulation programs partially due to the information 
being expressed differently.  The complexity that remains 
that is unique to building simulation can be minimized.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200106111248.AA485937md80000054502@gard.com>

I have worked with hourly building simulation since 1977 and DOE-2 in
particular since 1984. I consider myself a decent simulation user, but must
continuously consult with my HVAC colleagues in insure that what the
simulation is doing is:

a) Something that can happen in reality
b) Happens in the expected sequence of operations
c) Is simulated conservatively enough to predict results that can be
verified.

My biggest complaint with the current DOE-2 is that I must consult FOUR
manuals (DOE-2.1A Reference, DOE-2.1E BDL Summary and Supplement, the JJ
Hirsch Version 110 and higher Supplement, and the Current Errata Tables),
each in the proper sequence, to insure the model takes all the proper
parameters into account.

"User Friendly" for Building Simulation to ME should be a complex
documentation  (Read: BOOK, not on-line menus) of

1) The sequencing and interrelationship between program modules
2) The HVAC systems that can be simulated, with their related parameters
3) Documentation of error messages and what they can mean
4) Updates to this documentation, not Supplements !!

User friendly should mean that a person who has sufficient understanding of
HVAC systems can find answers to his simulation question. One who does NOT
foster this understand will naturally be lost.

If I don't use DOE-2 for a few months (other tasks become prevalent), I
sometime feel I must relearn part of the program, because the "A" manual
explanation was then changed in the "C" version, and once again in the "E"
version 110 and higher. A single, complex, but annotated documentation of a
building simulation program will give the appropriate users all the "User
Friendliness" they need.

I agree strongly with what Daniel says. Whenever I
hear people speaking of the need for more
user-friendly software, it makes me shudder. Not
because I'm opposed to user-friendliness in software,
but because it usually is mistaken for meaning
over-simplification. Choices of control strategies and
options are often left out in order to make the
software more manageable. And the implication is that
since the software is user-friendly, anyone can use
it, without knowing what is really going on in the
background. Which leads to engineers with little or no
simulation experience thinking they can whip off
building models for clients and declare themselves
energy experts. There needs to be far more knowledge
of design and operation by simulators and software
developers, and detailed knowledge of the simulation
tool by mechanical and electrical engineers if they
wish to do simulation.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Building Simulation in the U.S.
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200106111149.AA490951md80000054454@gard.com>

The fundamental problem with building simulation, which a "friendly" user
interface can only partially address, is that one needs to understand the
energy systems in a building in order to model them correctly.  Failing
that, it's "garbage in, garbage out".  The first constraint on simulation is
that most people don't have a sufficient level of understanding to use it
correctly.  The second constraint is that, even with sufficient
understanding, it requires a lot of detailed information about the building
in order to build an adequate model.  Few real world projects have the
resources to devote to gathering and inputting this detail, and then to
doing the subsequent analysis.  Decisions about energy systems have always
been made with much less information, so many people question the need for
simulation to get more information.

As energy becomes more of an issue, both through energy codes and because of
rising energy costs, there will be more project resources devoted to energy
analysis.  As computer tools become more sophisticated, the learning curve
to use them will also become shallower.  Perhaps these two trends will
converge, resulting in greater use of simulation tools. 

But we're not there yet.

Doug.

I don't disagree that a greater emphasis on producing 
"friendly" building energy simulation software could 
increase its usage as would greater training but are those 
really the biggest problems?  If they are, are they 
solvable?  What does "friendly" mean here?  If they are not 
the biggest problems, what else is preventing every 
building (or at least every large building) in the U.S. 
from being designed with the aid of energy simulation 
software?

I know I'm changing the topic but these are questions that 
I ponder and I'd like to know other people's impressions.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Building Simulation in the U.S.
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200106110859.AA593442md80000054380@gard.com>

A couple of thoughts for this discussion.  These thoughts are intended to
be arbitary, argumentative and discussion provoking.
1.  The primary failing I find with most simulation programs is that they
don't allow you to put systems together and to control the systems in
exactly the way they are designed to go together and be controlled.  This
failure may be because the program developer was not familiar with design
practice either in general, or in other regions of the country or the
world, or because design practice changes.  In general, this failure is due
to the fact that the programs are insufficiently flexible to allow systems
to be configured in a variety of ways. 
2.  There is often confusion about sensitivity and accuracy.  We need to
recognize that we are involved in analysis that has an overall accuracy
that may be plus or minus 10% or so.  The most important characteristic of
our programs, however, is sensitivity.  We need to be confident that, while
the analysis may not give us credits or debits to within hundredths of a
percent, it will give us the right credits or debits of the approximate
magnitude, for all the things we want to test. Furthermore, we need to be
confident that the interactions among the various components are evaluated
at approximately the right magnitude.
3.  The interface issue, while important, shouldn't be overstressed.  Until
we incorporate significant amounts of artificial intelligence into the user
interface, an uninformed user will still produce an uninformed analysis.
Building simulation is no different from any other GIGO situation (garbage
in, garbage out).  Some people have spent entire careers at building
simulation.  No current user interface technology can enable a novice user
to extract the value from a simulation program than can be extracted by an
expert.
4.  All of the current building simulation programs (with the exception of
thermal network ESP-R derivatives) assume a well-mixed air situation in
each thermal zone.  As long as that assumption holds, there is little
benefit to evaluating the differential radiation transfer among the
surfaces of a zone.  In very few buildings, do the external walls see one
another. If no external walls see one another, and if the zone is assumed
to be well mixed, assuming a combined radiation/convection heat transfer
coefficient of the interior surface of the wall has little penalty in terms
of accuracy, because the interior partitions seen by this external wall
will be very near to the temperature of the well-mixed room air.  If
vertical air nodes are assumed within the zone, to accommodate
stratification, then the individual interior and exterior partitions must
also be vertically divided so that the surface temperature variation over
the vertical expanse of the partitions may be evaluated.  Quickly the
computation overhead for this capability approaches CFD magnitude.
5.  Finally, the very best simulation experts do design, either for new
buildings or retrofit.  Not only does the design process inform the
simulation process, but learning from the simulation process makes superior
designers.

Chip,
At Georgia Tech we are doing quite a bit on Building Simulation. I 
presented a keynote paper at the IBPC 2000 Conference in Eindhoven last 
September, with an overview of trends and challenges for building 
simulation. It refers to some of our own work.
I can send a pdf version to interested readers (Netiquette prohibits me to 
add an attachment to a message to the list).

One key effort in collaboration with UMichigan (Malkawi) and 
Carnegie-Mellon University (Mahdavi) is the Design Analysis Interface (DAI) 
project, funded by DOE. The project is starts this summer.

A short summary of the DAI project:
The basic premise of the research is that building simulation needs to be 
viewed in its process context. E.g. the steps for the fulfillment of a 
design request must be defined in an analysis (simulation) scenario. In the 
DAI approach these scenarios are captured explicitly, and are unique to 
each project. Every step in the scenario may call a generic analysis 
function, which can be delegated to a particular simulation software at 
execution time. This provides a clean separation between function and 
software implementation.
At the same time each step in a scenario needs input data, that is derived 
from available design information. This derivation is done through a 
mixture of computable mappings (based on the IAI-IFC or other structured 
information) and user-driven constructive mappings of  other information 
(mainly concerned with expert modeling of simulation inputs).
One fundamental aspect of the research is to develop effective 
communication with the tool user community, in particular the EnergyPlus 
community.
They will help to identify, advise and later assess the capabilities of 
what is produced.  We need to identify their most common use scenarios and 
understand clearly the processes typically followed to diagnose, pose then 
test solutions. Given these processes, we will develop interfaces, new 
tools or other technology that facilitates the identified scenarios.
We will be hosting workshops with simulation practitioners this fall. 
Invitations will be announced using this mailing list.

Fried Augenbroe

I am fairly new to building simulation but my past experiences lead me to
believe that every end user is going to have different requirements and
expectations.  Rather than focusing on developing a tool with broad market
appeal, focus on creating a platform from which a number of different
end-user GUI's can be easily developed.   Data for a building should be
transportable between different end-use GUI's.  For example, a designer uses
one GUI to create building loads, the building owner then uses a different
GUI, with data from designer, to track energy use.

Energy Plus seems to be taking this approach and DOE2 has certainly been
used as an engine for less-technical GUI's (i.e. FEDS and CompareIT).  Maybe
the solution is figuring out where these programs are deficient in this
regard and using that as a starting place for a better building simulation
tool.

A tool that can be used as an engine, with easily adaptable GUI's and
transportable data would have appeal to a much broader market than just
consultants and researchers.

Just a thought.

-Michael Tillou, etc Group

PS: Consultants and researchers would no longer be needed if the program
were THAT easy to use.

Building simulation software development needs to come to grips with
balancing
the needs of users and improving accuracy.  You may have the most accurate
algorithm for calculation that requires modeling data which the user needs
to
look up the definition in a handbook - game over!!

Only when the software is developed from end-user perspective we can make an
impact on the proliferation and use of the simulation tools.  Otherwise only
the

So the discussion may need to start in defining who are the end users of

I don't disagree that a greater emphasis on producing 
"friendly" building energy simulation software could 
increase its usage as would greater training but are those 
really the biggest problems?  If they are, are they 
solvable?  What does "friendly" mean here?  If they are not 
the biggest problems, what else is preventing every 
building (or at least every large building) in the U.S. 
from being designed with the aid of energy simulation 
software?

I know I'm changing the topic but these are questions that 
I ponder and I'd like to know other people's impressions.

We use simulation heavily for existing buildings' analysis and in support of
new building design. We are currently working on both low energy design and
LEED compliance analysis for new buildings, working directly for the owner
as an adjunct to the design team.
I am often concerned that the US DOE efforts on new simulation tools looses
sight of a significant portion of the audience - practicing consultants and
designers. While we want rigorous accurate tools they must also be user
friendly. Not simple, because buildings are not simple, but friendly.
Simulation would be used more frequently if it were.
I think there should be as much emphasis placed on interface and speed as
there is on mathematical modeling. There also needs to be significantly more
training and outreach.

Greetings --

I am giving a talk next week at the eSim 2001 conference in Ottawa titled
"Building Simulation in the U. S."  The idea is to give a 30 minute
overview of simulation activity in the U.S.

I've web searched and talked to many people, trying to make sure I don't
miss anything that deserves mention.

If you are involved in simulation-related work in the U.S. that you think
should be covered (and I haven't already contacted you), please send me
some brief info.  In particular, I'd like to get more info from people
using simulation in design practice (or hear why you don't use simulation).

I emphasize BRIEF -- the topic is large and the talk is short.  I will
finish preparing my presentation on Mon., so send a few words and/or URLs
today.  Thanks for any help!

Going by the Energy Cost Budget Method of compliance in 90.1 there are 
relatively few parameters which can be changed.  However, the rules are 
somewhat different for a LEED comparison.  90.1 does not allow a comparison 
between radically different HVAC systems for example, a LEED comparison 
does.  Check out the pertinent sections in the LEED Reference Guide for a 
complete discussion of what is and is not allowed in a LEED comparison, it 
is different than a strict 90.1 comparison.  This would account for the 
difference in the 35% going by 90.1 and the higher values in LEED.  We just 
submitted a project that exceeded 90.1 by 55% using the LEED allowed 
methods of comparison.

Again, please pardon our cross-posts.  This is a friendly reminder to
please respond to the  TC 4.7 Research Survey and pass this e-mail along
to anyone you know who uses the ASHRAE handbooks or other ASHRAE
products.

ASHRAE Technical Committee (TC) 4.7, Energy Calculations, is evaluating
the results of its research to guide future activities. As part of our
evaluation, we would like to know how the results of our past research
projects have contributed to the HVAC and building communities.
Eighteen research projects have been sponsored (or co-sponsored) by TC
4.7 since 1990. Twelve of the projects are complete and publications
ranging from technical papers to software toolkits have been published
by ASHRAE.

Results of the survey will be presented at the next TC 4.7 meeting
during the ASHRAE Annual Meeting in Cincinnati. The evaluation report
will  be forwarded to ASHRAE Society-level committees for their
consideration in future research policy and funding decisions.

Your input is very important. Please take a few minutes to respond to
the survey. Links to abstracts of papers from the research projects are
provided for your reference.

This survey is not sponsored by ASHRAE headquarters. If you have any
questions or need further information, please contact Vern Smith at
303-444-4149 or by email vsmith at archenergy.com.

We have been involved locally with trying to use ASHRAE 90.1, both 1989 and
1999 as a metric in new building design - i.e., `xx% better than code
minimum' for both LEED compliance and for a State buildings program. I know
there are a number of similar programs and initiatives throughout the
country. I am also slated to give a presentation on "Issues Around Using
ASHRAE 90.1-1999 as a Metric" at the ASHRAE Annual meeting in June (Seminar
28).
I'm looking for two things - first what experiences have people had with
`exceeding' the code by x%? I've heard rumors that a reputable simulation
firm said 35% can't be done if you strictly interpret the code. LEED
provides credit for 40% and 50% improvements. We've been using a completely
arbitrary target of 35%, which with a little  c o d e  stretching seems to
be obtainable. What is realistic based on your experience?
Second, I would like to get some feedback on the whole `using 90.1 as a
metric` issue that I might include in my presentation to round it out a
little.
Any feedback would be appreciated and of course I would credit anything I
used in the Seminar.
