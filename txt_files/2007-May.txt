eQuest has a weather utility to create a packaged BIN file from 8760
format.

http://doe2.com/ - download the weather processor. There is
documentation available there also.

 

Thanks,

To whom it may concern:

 

Does anyone know of any programs or features that make it easy to create
packed weather files from an unpacked file (for use with
eQUEST/DOE-2.2)?  I have some ancient DOS executables that might be
pressed into service, but am hoping to find something easier to use.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200705311709.AA091515pd80001429477@gard.com>

My original message (below) may be misleading - the mail room is part of
a larger, seldom-occupied basement (~10% of total floor area) that
includes some parking and mechanical/electrical rooms.
 
My apologies for any confusion.

Subject: What constitutes a floor for 90.1?


To Whomever may be able to shed some light -
 
I am modeling a non-res building <75,000 sqft for LEED certification. It
has 3 above-grade floors and a basement with a small (~0.4% of total
building floor area), normally-occupied mail room. The number of floors
influences the baseline HVAC system according to 90.1, but 90.1
specifically excludes basements under its definition of a story. Table
3.1.1A of Appendix G, which designates the baseline HVAC system types,
refers to the number of floors as one of the determinants of the
baseline HVAC system. The definition of a floor in 90.1 does not so
clearly address basements. My question is whether this should be
considered a 3- or 4-floor building? My sense is that it should be
considered 3, but I would like to get some verification if any is
available.
 
Thanks in advance.

I've edited my library file to contain some often used schedules.  They
show up when running the program, and load fine.   I'll then simulate
the building, once again fine, no errors, but during the rebuilding of
the model after the parametric runs, the schedules are deleted from the
project.  Anyone have this problem in the past?
Thanks in advance,
Brett

7:00 PM    Dinner (cost $40)

8:00 PM (approx)    After-dinner talk:  Kelly Speakes, United Technologies Corp.
Kelly Speakes is presently sustainable strategies leader and a UTC representative to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Energy Efficiency in Buildings (EEB) Project. Speakes has been active for ten years in the distributed and decentralized generation markets, representing global providers of equipment and services. She is the author of several published articles in energy trade magazines such as Power Economics and Energy Central. Speakes holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Boston University.
 
Kelly's talk will include an overview and status of the EEB project.  See the full abstract below:
 
The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) is a coalition of 190 multi-national corporations whose shared commitment to sustainable development and practices are recognized around the world.  In 2006, the WCBSD launched the Energy Efficiency in Buildings (EEB) Project, a three year effort led by co-chairs Lafarge and United Technologies Corporation, with a vision of a world where buildings consume zero net energy. The 10 member companies of the project, many of which are Fortune 500 companies in the field of building products and services, represent the voice of business in their effort to issue and promote a comprehensive and credible action plan to achieve the vision, focusing on six key global markets:  Brazil, China, Europe, India, Japan, and US.
 
Buildings consume roughly 40% of the world's energy resources and are a significant contributor to carbon emissions. In the urgency to transform the building sector, a zero net energy building is an aggressive and necessary response to global energy and climate change issues.  These actions can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the world's cities. In the short term, energy efficiency improvements can be achieved through a holistic approach to building design, construction and operation, driven by increased awareness and changes in behavior. In the longer term, facilitation by process and information technology, products and services that support these outcomes, financial mechanisms to prove them economically viable and balanced encouragement through policy and regulation are necessary to transform the industry. 
 
By summer 2007 this three year effort will assess the current state of the building industry and analyze the opportunities and barriers.  By May 2008, conduct scenario analysis to overcome financial and institutional barriers that inhibit zero net energy buildings. By May 2009, issue and promote a comprehensive and credible action plan, using stakeholder roadmap validation.
 
This presentation will include an overview and status of the EEB project. The project's key themes of market perceptions that shape financial mechanisms and institutional barriers, holistic technical approaches, and behaviors and awareness will be discussed.  Finally, the presentation will provide an assessment on the role of equipment and energy efficiency improvements and standards in driving down overall energy consumption in the US in various commercial and consumer product areas.

                                                          
Reservations:      To make a reservation contact Peter Ellis < peter_ellis at nrel.gov> via email by June 19, 2007, 5 PM (MDT).  Confirmation of reservations will be sent via email (if you do not receive a confirmation within two business days, please resend your reservation request).

Brian,

 

Duct energy loss due to leakage is a real, significant problem that is well
documented. Check out http://epb1.lbl.gov/aerosol/index.html for more
publications on duct leakage and aerosol sealing. You might want to contact
Dr. Mark Modera for his experience with the duct sealing technologies
(mpmodera at lbl.gov; mark.modera <mailto:modera at carrier.utc.com>

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] HVAC duct losses and energy impact

 

 

1) Any real world data on new and older building HVAC duct losses, or
anecdotal evidence or opinions about significance of duct losses on energy
usage?

 

2) There are commercial retrofit and new duct sealing technologies that go
beyond standard seam sealing.  Any experience or opinions about the
effectiveness and energy savings benefit of any of those?  

 

Thanks,

Brian,
The firm, Ecotope, in Seattle, WA, has done a lot of research about duct 
losses and duct sealing for the Northwest Power Planning Council and 
others.  Try them for info.

Lynn,
You have to draw a polyline around the floor plan and zones you are trying to import and save it into AutoCad 2000 or 2004. Its difficult to just import any AutoCad file into eQuest without changing into a single layer polyline first. Usually, I trace over the floorplan with a polyline and then save just the polyline as a separate drawing.
Ren?e

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Importing DWG files


To All
 
I am trying to import DWG files into eQuest without much success. When I specify the file to import, the preview window displays what looks like a reasonable drawing, although the small size prevents discerning any detail. The resulting imported drawing seems to have only a few layers of the drawing displayed, none of them providing any information about floor or zone shapes. I have tried numerous combinations of layers to no avail (I can get less information, but can't seem to get more). I have successfully imported files in the past, but zoning has changed and, as the building has two faces that are concentric arcs with most interior walls laid out radially, so accurate location of vertices without the drawings is next to impossible. As it is, I have to drop back to the schematic wizard, get the zoning down, then patch in what I can salvage from the earlier models. Any thoughts about what might be creating this difficulty. I don't have a CAD package at my disposal, so I can't make adjustments to the drawings themselves.
 
Thanks in advance.

Somewhat dated?  Jeff is right that ELCAP is rich PNW data and a great
thought, but understand it is 1980s data and may not be readily available
digitally.

FYI. 

Try ASHRAE's 1093 diversity factor toolkit, and add a weather daytyping
preprocessor as defined by Hadley or Bou Saada. Also, you can cross-check
against the somewhat dated ELCAP profiles. The final report for the toolkit
contains 10+ load shapes from Oregon, Washington, Idaho.

I have a client who has electricity utility load shape data for 11 different
climate zones (climate zones, 1-10 and climate zone 13) in California.

 

They would like to use this information to inform discussion about load shapes
in the Northwest, in particular in climate zones for Oregon, Washington,
western Montana, and Idaho.

 

Any suggestions about a reasonable way to map, and or adjust data from the
California climate zones, to these other zones? 

 

Thanks

In the DOE2.1e reference manual there is a solar driven absorption 
chiller.  The documentation is sketchy.  Does anyone have any 
experience using this chiller and how does one specify the amount of 
solar gain possible to apply to the chiller?

Thanks for all your assistance!

You can also run the model twice:
- Once with the actual envelope construction (walls,
roof glazing and infiltration)
- Second setting all envelope properties to zero

The difference will give you the approximate OA load
and energy consumption attributable to the OA.

Hope this helps,

A couple of things to look at:

 

1)      The SV-A report gives you the OA % for each system

2)      The reason your SS-G report has zeros is it is not a zonal
system (Fan coils, PTACs)  SS-G reports zonal energy rather than
system energy - SS-A gives you the system cooling and heating energy.

3)      You can look at the difference between the LS-B or LS-E
reports which are internal and envelope loads without ventilation and
the SS-I or SS-J reports which have ventilation to isolate ventilation
energy.

All,

 

Does anyone know which SIM file report summarizes outside air loads by
zone/system?  Have searched the report for 'vent' and 'osa' (with
'match case' unchecked) but found nothing.  

 

Best of all would be a report that summarized all zone/system loads,
including ventilation air.  The closest I found was "SS-B System Loads
Summary" and "SS-G Zone Loads Summary" but neither break-out
ventilation.  You can also go to the 'Summary' tab in the eQuest GUI,
but that doesn't breakout ventilation either.

 

As to whether ventilation air energy is rolled into cooling and/or
heating numbers, I cannot tell because both of the these columns in
the SS-G report have all zeros in them, and every single value on the
the SS-B report is equal to zero!

 

Very curious, as I'm getting what I thought were reasonable numbers in
other parts of the SIM file, and in the graphical simulation output
reports.  Does anyone know what the issue might be?

 

 

Thanks in Advance

Hi Chris,

The Baseline building should be modeled with no generator (no CHP system).
In the Proposed building, you will model the CHP system with whatever heat
recovery is actually installed in the design.  You would not model any heat
recovery in the Baseline design unless condenser heat recovery is
prescriptively required (for 24-hour facilities with large DHW & cooling
loads).

It sounds from your description like the "backup source" for your absorption
cooling and heating would be natural gas.  The question is: what is used for
cooling and heating when the generator is out of service?  Do you have
natural gas boilers for backup?  Then your backup heating fuel source is
natural gas.  Do you have electric chillers operating when the generator is
off line or using its full waste heat capacity to drive heating and DHW?
Then your backup cooling fuel source is electricity.  Are you using steam or
hot water from your natural gas boilers to drive the absorption cooling
process when the generator is off line?  Then your backup cooling fuel
source is natural gas.

Best Regards,
Gail Stranske

I am modelling a design with cogen for electricity, absorption 
cooling, space heat, domestic hot water.  I have read through the 
"CHP Calculation Methodology for LEED-NC v2.2 EA Credit 1" paper and 
I am not sure how to model the Baseline case for EA Credit 1.  It 
sounds like the Baseline case does get the same CHP system: "The 
Baseline Building heating and cooling plant utilizes the backup 
energy source(s) of the Design, or electricity if no backup source is 
present or specified." for Case 1 as is with my Design case.  I think 
that the cooling in the Baseline case would not make use of excess 
heat (absorption cooling).  Would the Baseline make use of excess heat for DHW?

Thanks to everyone. I can import CAD file now.

The drawing that I have tried to import is an architectural base drawing and it references to another file. After detached the referenced drawing and made it only one layer, the CAD file can be imported. BTW, I use AutoCAD 2007.

 I've often copied only the layer I need, or even most of the time I make a new layer that is only the outline of what I need, into a new drawing for import.  No backgrounds and all of that stuff, just outlines of the zones that I'll need to trace.
  
 Good  luck!
  
 David

Is this a file from Architectural Desktop or Building Systems?  If so,
suggest that you try exporting to 'plain vanilla' AutoCAD 2004 file

Jannes,

 

Soil thermal properties are very much a function of the soil moisture
content, which makes it a little difficult to assign constant values to
the properties.  However, that is what we have to do without solving the
heat and moisture transfer problems simultaneously.  I did a comparison
between a heat transfer model and a heat and moisture transfer model for
my disseration.  You can get reasonable results with the heat transfer
model with a constant value of thermal conductivity.  The best result
was to model the top 1 meter of soil with one value of thermal
conductivity and soil below this with a higher thermal conductivity to
simulate a higher moisture content.  My dissertation (A Model for
Ground-Coupled Heat and Moisture Transfer from Buildings) is available
from http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy03osti/33954.pdf.   Appendix C presents
information on soil properties as a function of moisture content.
Specifically, Figure C.4 shows the thermal conductivity of soil with
moisture content.  I would recommend assuming a volumetric moisture
content between 155 and 20% for setting the thermal properties.

Ramana,

Here is a brief explanation of what I meant by water side. I would also like
to point out here that my intention was not to create a debate over the
capabilities of IES and DB. It was just a brief comparison based on my
understanding of IES <VE> modeling capability..
?
Waterside
'IES?<VE> cannot model water side' means that it does not explicitly model
the flow of hot and cold water through pipes, water flow control mechanisms,
tanks, headers etc?and the consumption of energy in pumps. Instead these
factors are accounted for using simple modeling. DesignBuilder does model
the 'water side' through EnergyPlus when modeling fan coil unit and VAV HVAC
systems.

Regards,

Mahabir

DesignBuilder simulation is carried out using DOE EnergyPlus simulation

We all wish! Title 24 for California projects has this compliance method and it does save a lot of time, though a little difficult to tell what it is doing to the model. The baseline ASHRAE 90.1-2004 has to be run as a separate energy model using Appendix G guidelines plus addendum changes. I'm not sure if the eQuest developers are in the process of doing this for ASHRAE 90.1-2004  base case as well but probably not since the funding for eQuest is largely provided by utilities based in California.

Mahabir,

I think you forgot to mention one of the most important comparison between DesignBuilder and IES : is that IES has the modeling capabilities through BIM and DesignBuilder through CAD,which make a much difference in term of accuracy,quality,speed,coordination,and linked to the other applications.

PS As an independent DOE-2 consultant and researcher,one of my job is to unbiased test,examine,verify the software and offer truthful public information to the best of my knowledge.Every software has its own capabilities and users should know before they invest their money,time and effort.

Dear all,

We're working on a project in Iowa and just beginning to think about
energy code compliance. Iowa's state energy code is IECC 2006.

How does code compliance work generally? I know that COMcheck can be
used to check for compliance (never used it though). Do all components
like roof, wall, glazing etc have to meet the minimum requirement or is
trade off possible?

Is there a Btu/sq ft component involved?

   Hi Ramana,

    
   I have used the energy code compliance check on two projects both
   rResCheck and CoMCheck , my understanding of these tools is that
   there is no trade off involved , all the building components have to
   meet the minimum code requirements , otherwise it is difficult to
   make it pass the code. the minimum values are displayed at the lower
   end of the screen as we keep entering the values and at the same time
   it shows the percentage progress of the with respect to the local
   code . also there is no Btu/sq sf  or energy use intensity involved.

Dear BLDG-SIM Users:
As many of you are aware, glazing manufacturer's performance data from a
variety of commercial glass manufacturers recently has been made
available when specifying from the Glass Library for DOE2.2/eQuest. As I
understand it, these values are based on LBNL's WINDOW 5 glazing
analysis program. The main advantage of specifying this way is that this
method more accurately includes solar incident angle affects on the
percentage of direct transmission of solar gains through the
fenestration. This method is in lieu of using the Simplified
Specification method where the user directly inputs an overall
conductance, shade coefficient, VLT and outside emissivity. 
 
My question is this: When using the Glass Library specification method,
how are users out there accounting for the frame affect to the windows
being modeled when in Detailed Edit Mode? There isn't an input available
to specify the window frame being used.
 
The eQuest Wizard allows the user to assign frames to specific glazing
type (including the Library values mentioned above). Ostensibly the
Wizard is de-rating the center of glass U factors obtained from the
glass library data to account for frame affects and thus providing an
overall U value for the simulation. However recent discussion at the May
BSUG meeting leads one to question if this assumption is valid. Maybe
Scott Criswell or Kevin Madison can shed some light on this?

Hi Ramana,

I have used the energy code compliance check on two projects both rResCheck
and CoMCheck , my understanding of these tools is that there is no trade off
involved , all the building components have to meet the minimum code
requirements , otherwise it is difficult to make it pass the code. the
minimum values are displayed at the lower end of the screen as we keep
entering the values and at the same time it shows the percentage progress of
the with respect to the local code . also there is no Btu/sq sf  or energy
use intensity involved.

Presuming you're using eQuest, you may want to use or modify the
following user expressions to define the glass.  This is what they look
like within the DOE2 file; if you're writing them using the detailed
editor interface, the syntax is slightly different (e.g. I don't believe
you need the equals-sign or anything to the left of it): 

X = {PARENT("WIDTH")*0.025}
Y = 0
HEIGHT = {PARENT("HEIGHT")}
WIDTH = {PARENT("WIDTH")*0.95} 

The expressions above cover 95% of a given wall surface with glass.  You
may be able to bump it up.

Kevin,

Forgot to mention this shortcut----

To make it easier, you can set the default x,y,height,and width to
something like this:

X = {PARENT("WIDTH")*0.025}
Y = {PARENT("HEIGHT")*0.025}
HEIGHT = {PARENT("HEIGHT")*0.95}
WIDTH = {PARENT("WIDTH")*0.95}

Depending on your frame size you might need to adjust this slightly.
This should save you considerable time.

A number of changes have been made to Appendix G specifically to deal
with its inadequacies in modeling laboratory buildings and systems.
These will be reflected in the 2007 version of 90.1 which should be
released sometime this year. In the meantime, these changes were not
published in any official addenda, so I do not think they can be used as
allowed by USGBCs recent ruling to allow ASHRAE addenda.

Hi Bill,

I'm of the opinion that many laboratory spaces DO meet the intent of
this
exception and MAY be modeled with PSZ systems.  The basis for my
opinion is
the 90.1-2004 User's Manual, Section 6.5.2.1, which specifically
mentions
"areas of hospitals, operating rooms, and laboratories that must be
maintained @ positive or negative pressures to prevent contaminants
from
entering" as examples of zones where special pressurization
relationships,
cross-contamination requirements, or code-required minimum circulation
rates
are such that variable air volume systems are impractical.  Also,
laboratory
spaces often have high process loads meeting or exceeding the 10
Btuh/sqft
threshold when compared against adjacent hallways, offices, and/or
classrooms.

If I were preparing LEED Documentation for a V2.2 lab building, I
would
probably provide an accompanying narrative that specifically references
the
Appendix G exception, and the User's guide Section 6.5.2.1
clarification.

Make sure that the (window width + 2x the frame width) is less then
the wall width.  The same goes for the height.  If the whole building
is covered in glazing, make sure you do this for each wall.

Dear all,

We're working on a project in Iowa and just beginning to think about energy
code compliance. Iowa's state energy code is IECC 2006.

How does code compliance work generally? I know that COMcheck can be used to
check for compliance (never used it though). Do all components like roof,
wall, glazing etc have to meet the minimum requirement or is trade off
possible?

Is there a Btu/sq ft component involved?

Thanks in advance,

Josh,

In my opinion, here are some points of comparison between DesignBuilder and
IES <VE>: 

 
GENERAL BUILDING SIMULATION CAPABILITIES
DesignBuilder and IES <VE> have quite similar capabilities for modeling
fabric, solar shading, internal gains, daylighting, natural ventilation etc.
DesignBuilder simulation is carried out using DOE EnergyPlus simulation
engine and the IES <VE> simulations use the Apache simulator.

I work for an architectural firm that hired me to gain building energy
modeling capabilities. As they've never done this before, the first order of
business is selecting an application to carry out said building energy
modeling.

Taking a preliminary survey of the available applications and comparing them
with our criteria yielded two "finalists":  DesignBuilder and the IES <VE>.
I've been demoing each of them for a little while and reading the
documentation, and although I've definitely been able to identify some pros
and cons for each, I feel I lack the experience/knowledge to make a
definitive decision.

If anyone uses or has used either of these programs, has any opinion of
them, or has even heard rumours about them circulating about the grape vine,
any insights they could offer would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Josh

The requirement to  distribute fenestration uniformly in horizontal

the published Addenda Supplement to 90.1, 2004. See the ASHRAE website
for the supplement.

Appendix G notes that for the Baseline building: "Vertical 
fenestration areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that 
in the proposed design or 40% of gross above grade wall area, 
whichever is smaller, and shall be distributed uniformly in 
horizontal bands across the four orientations."
Does this mean that the Baseline building gets windows on all walls 
on each orientation whether or not the Design case has a window in 
all walls on each orientation.  For example, if the west orientation 
has 30% glazing overall but many spaces have no windows - some walls 
on the west face have more that 30%.  Do those spaces in the Baseline 
case get 30% glazing?  Or do I only put windows in the Baseline case 
where there are windows in the Design case.

Thanks for any help!

where there are windows in the Design case.

Thanks for any help!

Hi Bill,

I'm of the opinion that many laboratory spaces DO meet the intent of this
exception and MAY be modeled with PSZ systems.  The basis for my opinion is
the 90.1-2004 User's Manual, Section 6.5.2.1, which specifically mentions
"areas of hospitals, operating rooms, and laboratories that must be
maintained @ positive or negative pressures to prevent contaminants from
entering" as examples of zones where special pressurization relationships,
cross-contamination requirements, or code-required minimum circulation rates
are such that variable air volume systems are impractical.  Also, laboratory
spaces often have high process loads meeting or exceeding the 10 Btuh/sqft
threshold when compared against adjacent hallways, offices, and/or
classrooms.

If I were preparing LEED Documentation for a V2.2 lab building, I would
probably provide an accompanying narrative that specifically references the
Appendix G exception, and the User's guide Section 6.5.2.1 clarification.

Can anyone provide feedback on the intent of ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G
Exceptions to G3.1.1 which allow changes to the baseline HVAC systems
prescribed in Tables G3.1.1A and G3.1.1B for spaces with special
pressurization requirements or spaces where peak thermal loads differ by
more than 10 Btu/h-sqft? This exception would appear to allow Packaged
Single Zone air conditioners with gas-fired heating as baseline systems
in laboratory spaces with high equipment loads and/or pressurization
requirements. In a large lab building where the baseline system per
Table G3.1.1A is a VAV system, this could make a big difference in
calculated energy savings. A recent CIR (February  '07) on the USGBC
site implies that the exception should not be used although the question
involves reheat issues as well. It seems that a PSZ system could be
modeled successfully to meet zone conditions without reheat but does
this approach (simulating the baseline for a large laboratory building
with multiple PSZ systems) meet the intent of the exception?  Has anyone
else had any experience with this or can the A90.1 and LEED folks offer
some perspective?
Thanks,

Dear Fellow Energy modelers,

The following posting has been placed on the USGBC website (
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664
<http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664> ), which allows the
use of ASHRAE Addenda for all credits referencing ASHRAE standards.



	Use of approved Addenda for ASHRAE Standards referenced in LEED 
	
	Background:
	ASHRAE currently publishes Continuous Maintenance standards
every three years,
	with a Supplement published eighteen months after the Standard
is published. In rare
	cases, addenda are published in between the eighteen-month
periods. LEED 
	development and ASHRAE standards development are not aligned and
many addenda
	have been approved that would be useful for LEED project teams.
	
	Action:
	LEED project teams are required to use the ASHRAE Standard
referenced in the 
	applicable Reference Guide and are permitted to use addenda
within the most recent 
	Supplement to that Standard, as well as any approved addenda
published in between the
	eighteen-month periods. Project teams are responsible for
notifying LEED reviewers of
	the use of ASHRAE addenda utilized at the time of project
documentation submission.
	If a project team elects to use an addendum to an ASHRAE
Standard, this addendum 
	must be applied to the entire LEED submittal.

This should make fenestration modeling much easier for the Baseline Case
for projects opting to follow the Addendum.

If you dig around on the EIA site, you can find the wording of the
original questions.  The area question (SQFT8) had the following
language for the 2003 survey.  "What is the gross or total square
footage of all the space in this building, both finished and unfinished,
including basements, hallways, lobbies, stairways, elevator shafts and
indoor parking levels."

 

Maybe that answers your question but there is a lot more to it and one
should be very careful.  The values EIA reports for SQFT8 are NOT the
raw values reported by respondents.  EIA masks the identity of
individual buildings by shifting the area values in some unknown way.
They balance the area shifts with appropriate changes in the weighting
factors so that product of area and weighting factor are okay.  But, for
example, using SQFT8 data to calculate Energy Use Intensity (annual
energy per unit area) is not very accurate for an individual building.
I get very uncomfortable using CBECS data for area-normalized metrics
unless they are derived from more than about 100 samples.

One - How do you model exhaust fans that bring in OA for cooling with
automatic dampers?  The spaces also have unit heaters for heat.

Two- I am modeling a large kitchen with several sources of internal heat
loads.  I have modeled the HVAC system to represent the AHU/VAVbox system
serving the space.  However the space is also served by several makeup air
units and their associated exhasut hoods.  I am currently including all
heat gain from the equipment as space internal loads and am treating the
makeup air unit and exhaust fans as external loads.  This does not account
for any heat or humidity gained or lost by the makeup/exhaust system.  Does
anyone have any suggests for how to better model this scenario?

Three-How do you manipulate schedules to interact with the hourly reports?


Thank you,

Daryl

Oh yes - one of the reasons I'm trying to model the 3 pumps in 3 separate
loops is because we're thinking of dropping one of the pumps out and
re-plumbing due to changes in zoning within the building.  So I'm trying to
set up a good base model for this.

Hello - this is an elementary question, but I wasn't able to find an answer

I want...)

 

I'm using Equest and have a system with 2 hot water boilers that are staged.
The system has 3 pumps serving 3 separate zones.  What I am trying to do is
set up 3 separate hot water loops connected to the 2 boilers.  However, it
appears that I can't have more than one loop per boiler.  The boilers are
not set up with a primary/secondary loop (with the boilers having their own
pumps); if I do set up the plant with a primary/secondary loop can I then
attach multiple secondary hot water loops to the primary loop? If so how do
I do this?  Or am I missing something really basic here - it seems like
almost every boiler plant I've ever seen has multiple staged boilers and
multiple zones with multiple pumps.  It's so common it seems like it must be
(easily) model-able.

 

Thanks in advance.

Hello - this is an elementary question, but I wasn't able to find an answer

I want...)

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200705141034.AA3455921pd80001420183@gard.com>

Does anyone have a copy (or know where one can be obtained) of the
British Council for Offices' "Stanhope BCO Occupancy and Small Power
Position Paper", June 2000? It's been removed from their website. It was
a review of small power provisions and occupation densities in office
buildings.
 
Ultimately I'm looking for data on office plug loads and in the US and
UK, so other recommendations of more current assessments would be
welcome. I have most of the ASHRAE reports.
 
Thanks,
Jamy

The SimViewer has poor memory handling.  If you try to view more than 
one file or even a large sim file, it craps out.  Try UltraEdit - no 
problem with any size or any number of sim files.

I am encountering a problem where the glazing system I need to use covers
the entire wall area resulting in a negative net wall area and bad building
components.  Does anyone have any solutions that get around this problem?  A
related question to this would be, what is the best way to model spangrel
glass?
The spangrel is to be used throughout also.  Thank you for any advice.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200705111346.AA4606734pd80001419508@gard.com>

This is a recurring problem I have found as I use eQuest.

 

Spaces with low occupancy and high equipment loads (electrical
rooms/servers/etc) will cause the Heat Pump airside system to not meet
the minimum heating setpoint. Furthermore, if I try to change the system
to another, more standard system (VAV), the program remembers whatever
issue it had with the Heat Pump. I have to delete the system and start
fresh with another, reassigning all the zones. Can you help explain why
I can't use heat pumps attached to the condenser loop without having
heating-side issues?

 

Thanks,

 

Taylor

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST uninsulated joists
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200705111106.AA0653171pd80001419187@gard.com>

I am trying to model 9" thick uninsulated floor slab that occurs between
every floor of a 15 story building.  In order to do this, I need to model a
9" high portion of R-0 wall that recurs with every floor.  I am thinking of
aggregating all the joists into one 10' high (15 stories x 9") space with
R-0 walls, but am wondering if anyone is aware of a better method.

Thanks!

Best,
Andy

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200705092049.AA495146pd80001418416@gard.com>

Has anyone out there used the TROMBE-WALL-NV command in DOE2.2 to
effectively model a Trombe wall?  eQuest does not seem to offer this
command, so I am using text mode and following the guidance of the DOE
2.2 Dictionary (June 2006, pp 130-131).  In my model, the only change
when using this command (with appropriate WALL-PARAMETERS for the
construction: 0.1 emiss, 0.9 absorp, 1.5? channel width) appears to be
that heat load is increased when replacing the exterior wall with a
trombe-wall-nv, as the wall area is set equal to the trombe glass
(window) area.  No benefits appear to result from additional thermal
storage effect, as expected.  Was this feature fully developed?  Would I
be better off modeling a very narrow sunspace to represent the trombe
wall channel?  I?d welcome anyone?s input (particularly the DOE2
authors).

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] On-site U-value measurement
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200705091713.AA1309203pd80001418256@gard.com>

Radiation on the inner side of the wall is more than 50% of the overall heat
transfer, so it certainly can not be ignored.  It can be reasonably
estimated by using standard black body radiation equation, but it can not be
ignored.  Also, convective surface heat transfer coefficient of the wall is
not really known.  You would need to know if the air flow is within natural
or forced convection (i.e., measure velocity) to be able to get even close
to the real h.

 

For in-situ measurement of the U-factor, which is in reality heat flux
through the wall divided by air to air temperature difference:

 

U = q/(T_air-in - T_air-out)

 

The best and most reliable approach is direct measurement of q, which can be
accomplished by surface heat flux transducers.  These are available from
Omega and probably some other companies.  Their price is in $300 range.
They connect to standard DAS such as HP 34970A.  One thing to consider is
correction of outside air temperature if there is significant difference
between air temperature and radiation temperature (e.g., night sky
radiation).  There is standard equation for mean radiant temperature
calculation in that case, so T_air-out should be really T_mr_out.

Dear All,

 

Thanks for your replies.

 

We currently have a thermal camera but I never used it to record
quantitative results. Brandon, you mentioned about "tuning" the heat
transfer equation. If we write a steady-state surface heat balance equation
for the inner side of the wall:

Q_convection=Q_conduction

h*(T_air - T_wall_in)=k*(T_wall_in - T_wall_out)/x_wall 

where radiation is negligible and h is known, than we should be able to
calculate k and u-value, if I am not wrong. Is this what you mean by tuning?


 

The u-values that I obtain either by calculation or measurement need not to
be accurate in the academic level, instead it should be practical so as to
analyze more houses and reach more people. We actually intend to improve the
energy efficiency of houses for which neither we nor the inhabitant have
information about the constituents of the wall.

 

Prof. Sibilio, thanks for referring me the Hukseflux. As I called the
company, they told me that each heat flux measurement takes about 24 hours.
Is this the way you do it or do you know any tricks to get reasonable
results in a shorter time.

Gunes Inan

Hello,

 

You may find an infrared thermal imager to be a powerful tool, useful for
the application you have indicated and many others.  Here's a link to Fluke
Corp. thermal imaging notes for building systems, there are many other
manufacturers...

 

http://us.fluke.com/usen/support/appnotes/default?category=AP_TH_BM(FlukePro
ducts)
<http://us.fluke.com/usen/support/appnotes/default?category=AP_TH_BM(FlukePr
oducts)&parent=AP_THERMO(FlukeProducts> &parent=AP_THERMO(FlukeProducts)

 

For building systems, the thermal imager is useful for finding voids in
insulation, infiltration losses, calculating the overall heat loss
correction due to framing framing elements, etc..

 

Using the thermal imager, you will have to "tune" heat loss equations based
on observed temperature differential data to derive U-values. These
instruments typically have the ability to scan large areas and quickly
calculate a weighted average and other statistical factors for each image.  

 

Unfortunately they are not cheap, and probably overkill for just measuring
the U-values of specific materials.  Personally I don't know any way to
measure U-values directly with a hand-held instrument, but it seems such a
device wouldn't be hard to put together with a data acquisition unit and a
couple of thermocouples.

Another commenter mentioned accounting for non steady-state conditions.
This is also important, but if you can catch couple of hours of relatively
unchanging conditions, you should be OK.

Hello Gunes,
 
What I was originally thinking was along the lines of tuning the UA?T equation with a correction factor, based on a wall area with known U-value somewhere in your plant, so that relative U-values could be calculated directly from thermal image ?T data elsewhere.  
 
Given a known indoor temperature, this correction factor would account for a minor offset in camera calibration, or alternatively could be used to "tune" the camera calibration, with the objective of obtaining U-values accurate out two or three decimal places.
 
The application you describe is a bit different than what I was first envisioning.  If you're scanning residential walls, with less of an emphasis on accuracy and greater emphasis on surveying large areas quickly, then you may consider this approach:
 
Since U is inversely proportional to ?T, select an area of a given scanned wall with an estimable U-value, e.g. window, door, or framing elements.  Knowing the indoor temperature Ti and neglecting effects of radiation, convection and thermal inertia (apologies in advance to all heat-transfer academics), then U-values of unknown areas are essentially a product of the inverse of the differential temperatures times the known U-value:
 
  U2 = U1 * ((Ti-T1)/(Ti-T2)) 
 
Lets say the indoor temperature is measured at 20?C, a window in the thermal scan is estimated at a U-value of 1.0 W/m2*?C, and the external scan shows the window and adjacent wall temperatures to be 16?C and 10?C respectively:
 
  U2 = 1.0 * ((20-16)/(20-10)) = 0.4 W/m2*?C 
 
...for the U-value of the wall.  Here's where your thermal imaging postprocessing software will come in handy...exclude the window, and calculate the average surface temperature of the remaining wall to use in the equation above.
 
Hope that helps...

Dear All,

 

Thanks for your replies.

 

We currently have a thermal camera but I never used it to record quantitative results. Brandon, you mentioned about "tuning" the heat transfer equation. If we write a steady-state surface heat balance equation for the inner side of the wall:

Q_convection=Q_conduction

h*(T_air - T_wall_in)=k*(T_wall_in - T_wall_out)/x_wall 

where radiation is negligible and h is known, than we should be able to calculate k and u-value, if I am not wrong. Is this what you mean by tuning? 

 

The u-values that I obtain either by calculation or measurement need not to be accurate in the academic level, instead it should be practical so as to analyze more houses and reach more people. We actually intend to improve the energy efficiency of houses for which neither we nor the inhabitant have information about the constituents of the wall.

 

Prof. Sibilio, thanks for referring me the Hukseflux. As I called the company, they told me that each heat flux measurement takes about 24 hours. Is this the way you do it or do you know any tricks to get reasonable results in a shorter time.

 

Regards,

 

Gunes Inan

Konu: [BLDG-SIM] On-site U-value measurement

 

Hello,

 

You may find an infrared thermal imager to be a powerful tool, useful for the application you have indicated and many others.  Here's a link to Fluke Corp. thermal imaging notes for building systems, there are many other manufacturers...

 

http://us.fluke.com/usen/support/appnotes/default?category=AP_TH_BM(FlukeProducts)&parent=AP_THERMO(FlukeProducts)

 

For building systems, the thermal imager is useful for finding voids in insulation, infiltration losses, calculating the overall heat loss correction due to framing framing elements, etc..

 

Using the thermal imager, you will have to "tune" heat loss equations based on observed temperature differential data to derive U-values. These instruments typically have the ability to scan large areas and quickly calculate a weighted average and other statistical factors for each image.  

 

Unfortunately they are not cheap, and probably overkill for just measuring the U-values of specific materials.  Personally I don't know any way to measure U-values directly with a hand-held instrument, but it seems such a device wouldn't be hard to put together with a data acquisition unit and a couple of thermocouples.

I am trying to model Heat Pump Water Heaters (HPWHs) in a hotel
application for heating domestic hot water.  I set my type to "Heat
Pump" and entered 0.25 for the EIR (a COP of 4).  Oddly, the COP appears
to be set at 1.0 regardless of what I enter for the EIR.

 

I have the max heat pump temperature set at the loop temperature, so it
shouldn't be kicking into electric resistance backup.  Any idea how to
remedy this?

 

If I change the type to "Electricity" and adjust my EIR according, then
I see a savings, but you lose the part load effects of having the HPWH
curves modeled.  

 

Thanks in advance!

Dear all,

Another option is the use of a thermal probe apparatus. This is at an experimental stage but offers some interesting prospects that make it worthwhile. For instance approaches like hot box measurements tend to dry out the material, rendering some findings dubious, and take a long measurement time. We are using a commercial probe from another discipline on buildings, and have some encouraging results - allthough there are still a lot of issues to be solved as well. I know that UCL is also working in this field, allthough their focus so far is more on moisture content than on U-values - but obviously these two are intertwined.

For some previous publications in the field (which at my institute now go back almost a decade) search the literature for my colleagues Steve Goodhew and Dick Griffiths, or for UCL look for Mike Davies. You are also welcome to contact any of us off-list for further discussion on the topic.

Best regards,

Has anyone had any experience packing METEONORM generated .tm2 files
into .bin files with the DOE2 weather utility? If so, can you let me
know if this is a seamless process or if you have found that the
METEONORM .tm2 requires editing. Any information on what changes are

Hello All,

Does anyoneu have information on the cost/incremental cost (per square
footage) and payback of adapting the following credits into a project:

EA 1.1 - 1.10,

IEQ 1, 2, and 6.1 - 7.2.

 

I understand that in order to be accurate, it will be depending on building
type etc. to come up with an incremental cost of a system, but we just need
an example for illustration purposes.

Any information that you may have is greatly appreciated. 

 

Thanks

I would imagine it to be difficult to do with a hand held instrument.  Aside from how this hand held instrument would be designed, or if you could use some combination of the fluke product and some thermocouples, you'll have to account for the thermal storage effects that are occurring in any in-situ measurements....so even if you had the necessary instrument, you might not be able to get accurate results (or more accurate than from estimating based on the material properties) depending on the construction.
 
As part of my masters research we built a guarded hot box to measure the thermal conductivity of a wall assembly, but that was most definitely not a hand held instrument.  During that process you are subjecting the assembly to a steady state flux which you wouldn't necessarily have in-situ.
 
I guess it depends on how badly you need these measurements, or if you can quantify the constructions in some other way to accomplish your goals.  
 
David

PS: I note that you're an engineer in a manufacturing plant -- a thermal imager can pay for itself in such an environment when used in a "predictive maintenance" program.  
 
This augments a purely schedule-based "preventive maintenance" program with activities that strive to identify motors, transformers, switches, breakers, etc. that are actually in need of repair.  Some preventive maintenance activities are still required of course.
 
If a predictive/preventive maintenance program is implemented diligently, it can be more effective in avoiding catastrophic failure resulting in plant shutdown.
 
So this may provide some of the necessary additional justification for the expense of a thermal imager.

Has anyone had any experience packing METEONORM generated .tm2 files into .bin files with the DOE2 weather utility? If so, can you let me know if this is a seamless process or if you have found that the METEONORM .tm2 requires editing. Any information on what changes are necessary would be helpful.
Thanks,
Bill Talbert, AEI

I want to model a space (computer room) in eQUEST which is being served by a certain AHU and separate individual AC units (that provide extra sensible cooling only). eQUEST does not allow assigning two systems to a zone, so how does one get around such a situation?
I shall appreciate your help/ suggestions.

Problem solved and was related to the below advice. The first time I 
ran the simulation and the "view simulation results" window popped up 
I hit OK and it took awhile, so thinking I did not click OK I clicked 
it again. Soon two simulation reports opened. I closed one and had 
the "out of memory problem". After the below advice I closed the 
original simulation report and ran the simulation again. This time the 
copy function worked. 

Thanks All,
-Brad

I'm in the D2Sim Viewer (from eQuest) and I want to cut and paste to a 
spreadsheet. When I try to cut a window comes up that tells 
me "D2Simviewer out of memory". Any work arounds for this?

Go to file, export hourly data, and you should be able to open an excel

Dear All,

Hello all,

Does anyone have the weather file for Bahrain in energy plus or TMY2 format?

Thanks,

In the SD Wizard, screen 14, you can specify two schedules (Main & Alt)
and then specify the Alt schedule on screen 18 (everything might be on
Main and your corridors could be on the Alt). I don't think this is
accessible in the DD Wizard, unless you trick the DD Wizard w/specifying
a task lighting load and schedule for the corridors on screens 15 and 16
(of the DD Wizard).
 
In the Detailed Edit mode, you can specify five different lighting
systems/loads and schedules per zone. This can be accessed by clicking
the Internal Loads button and then double-clicking a zone and selecting
the Lighting tab. You can also edit this info in the Spreadsheet tab
under Internal Loads.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST multiple lighting schedules


I am working within the NYSERDA Energy Star modeling program and it
stipulates a specific lighting schedule for the apartments that varies
by the hour of the day and a "24-hour ON" schedule for the corridors.
Is there a way, without separating out the corridors as a separate
shell, of modeling two (or more) distinct lighting schedules for a
building? 

Thank you to Gerald and Scott for your help on my last question specific
to this program.

Best,
Andy
