specific energie in office buildingsYou would need to model it as an absorption chiller.  The chiller's heat input ratio and performance curves would need to reflect the combination of the steam turbine and the chiller compressor.

  Has anyone modeled steam turbine drive centrifugal chillers with DOE2.1E?  Is it possible to add this equipment to DOE2, given the part load performance data?

Hello All,

I'm currently modelling an eight story laboratory building using eQuest V 
3.44.  The main system in the building is a 100% outside air VAV system with 
steam heating at the airhandler coils and hot water reheat at the zone 
level.  I have created two seperate heating loops, one for the main coils 
and one for the reheat coils.  Each loop is fed by a Steam Meter and has a 
pump attached.

I am getting confusing results with respect to the models reheat energy.  In 
hourly reports that i have created, it shows the output of the reheat coils 
(Variable Type: HVAC Systems; Hourly Result Series: Total Zone Coil Output) 
and the load on the reheat water loop (Variable Type: Circulation Loop; 
Hourly Result Series: Heating Coil Load on Loop) to be different (load on 
the loop is only a fraction of the coil output).  I have tried several 
different configurations with primary loops, secondary loops, steam meters 
feeding the loop, boilers on the loop, but in each run the loop load is 
considerably lower than the coil output.

In a last ditch effort i changed the reheat coils from hot water coils to 
electric resistance coils to see if the electricity used by the coils would 
be equal to the output of the coils.  Surprisinly, this worked and i had a 
heating load that equal to the coil output.

This leaves me confused as to why, when i had the reheat coils as hot water 
i was not geting all of the coil load to transfer to the loop but the 
electric coils do.  If anyone has run into a similar problem and has solved 
it, or anyone who might know what i have done wrong, i would greatly 
appreciate your help.

Thanks in advance,

Yes.  See chapter 6 of the 2001 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals for
details 
(pp. 6.13-14).  An alternative is to get a program that does
psychrometric 
calculations, of which there are several (e.g., EES).

Wet bulb and dew point are independent parameters, and one cannot be
calculated from the other unless you know two independent psychrometric
parameters.  Knowing any two of the typical independent parameters  (e.g.
any two of dry bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature, relative humidity,
and/or absolute humidity) implies knowing the psychrometric state of the
air, and allows calculation of any of the other parameters.  ASHRAE
Fundamentals, Chaper 6 provides most of the relationships that are needed in
the form of empirical equations, as others have mentioned.



Note that dew point temperature, absolute humidity, and humidity ratio are
all representations of the absolute concentration of water vapor, and can be
converted back and forth without additional information (i.e. without
knowing the exact state), but wet bulb temperature is not equivalent.



Some of the psych. parameters are also dependent on absolute air pressure.
A caution:  If you use Equation (3) in the 2001 IP edition (the ASHRAE
formula for calculating absolute pressure as a function of altitude), the
result is in inches Hg, while most other pressures in the chapter are
presented in psia.  I've mentioned this to the editor with the suggestion
that all similar parameter within a chapter should have the same units.

Dear users,
I'm simulating a residential VAV system with TRNSYS. The air conditioner is the inverter unit RZP100DV1 of Daikin, whose minimum partial load (load/max capacity) is 31%, so the unit only cycles when PLR<0.31. How can I predict the degradation of system efficiency under these circumstances? What DOE-2 function should I use? Does somebody knows PLF functions for inverter units?

Al,
You could use Weathermaker - the weather program that comes with Energy10. It has an option to convert its own weather files into TMY2, or into a comma delimited text file that can be easily slipped into XL. If you have a TMY2 file, then you need to run a extrastep by first converting the TMY2 into the weathermaker (ET1) format, and then into a text file.
 
Hope this helps

I've got one too...you don't need anything!
 
Open the EnergyPlus weather files in excel, they are already CSV.  There
should be a description of the header in the documentation.
 
Alternatively, you can import your own TMY2 in excel by opening it or
importing it, and then use text functions to extract the data you want
out of the one column with all of the data according to the NREL TMY
user's manual.  Google should find that for you if you need it.
 
Lastly, each of the EnergyPlus files has a stat summary which may cover
much of the information you need without doing anything in excel at all.
If you need these in excel, "text to columns" will be your best friend.
 
Good luck!

Hi All.
I am simulating a building that is served by a
Dedicated Outdoor Air-System in the basement to treat
the outdoor air. There are 6 other air handling units
that serve different zones in the building.
Has anyone modeled this kind of situation or is there
a good method for simulating DOA with the AHU in DOE.

Your feedback is much appreciated.
Gerald

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200409031104.AA041900pd80000335157@gard.com>

Here is a possible solution (DOE2.1E) for occupancy based ventilation
using CO2 sensors in the return air system.

Create a MIN-AIR-SCH in the SYSTEMS module that is the occupancy
schedule from the LOADS module multiplied by the ratio of the design OA
and design SA.  Is this reasonable?

DOE-2.2, and thus eQUEST, does not currently have models of CO2 sensors

DOE-2.2 Dictionary (Volume 2) on page 344-358 (PDF page 346-360) for the
details of keywords that are used to define the Energy Recover
Ventilator (ERV)
capabilities.  Links to the six volumes of DOE-2.2 documentation for

We have a project underway to adds some forms of CO2 sensors and
controls into DOE-2.2; those features may not be available until early
next year.  Until that time you would need to use a scheduled minimum
OA damper position to approximate the CO2 controls.

Smita,
 
You might try checking the CA building codes authorities for their
requirements on seismic bracing.  I think this link gets you to their home
page:   http://www.bsc.ca.gov/index.html <http://www.bsc.ca.gov/index.html> 
 
It might take some nosing around to find the correct area, but it's a

Thanks for all these detailed references, they are indeed valuable. 
 
But what I need is the actual use data and not the effect of using metal
bracing. I need the actual amount of steel being used by the contractors in
California thru the various seismic zones. So its more a matter of a survey
database rather then the actual physics. 
 
I guess I need to ask this question in a contractors or a structural
engineers forum...

Several scientists at Oak Ridge National Lab worked with Enermodal to create
ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.7 "Energy Calculations" Report 1145 entitled
"Modeling 2 and 3 Dimensional Heat Transfer through Composite Wall and Roof
Assemblies in Hourly Energy Simulation Programs".  It essentially covers the
"Equivalent Wall Method" to analyze the steady state performance (R-value)
and transient performance of a wall system and accurately model it in say
DOE2.1 or Energy Plus which are limited by their one dimensional conduction
analysis for the building envelope.  If you are just interested in how the
metal bracing decreases the R-value, I would recommend "Thermal Breaking
Systems for Metal Stud Walls - Can Metal Stud Walls Perform as Well as Wood
Stud Walls" by some of the same researchers who worked with Energy Model on
the 1145 report mentioned above (Jan Kosny Jeffrey Christian Andre
Desjarlais)  This report covers the effect of using metal studs mainly in
residential applications but concepts can be applied to other applications
as well.  Both these publications use a Finite Difference program called
"Heating" which is very simple but robust to conduct heat transfer
calculations for pretty intricate wall assemblies.  It does both steady
state and transient analyses.  Hope this helps

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200409030821.AA2129828pd80000334898@gard.com>

Hi All,
I am trying to modeling a system in eQUEST with an
outdside air heat recovery. The unit has a built in
bypass dampers on the return air to the energy wheel
and the outside air.The outside air will be reduced by
use of a CO2 monitor and the bypass dampers on the
energy recovery wheel, that allows the return air to
go directly to the coil section.
1) What is the method of installing a bypass damper in
to the heat recovery in equest.
2) Is there a method of adding a CO2 meter which would
regulate the outside to do in directly to the coil?

Thanks,
Gerald

ASHRAE's IWEC (International Weather for Energy Calculations) data set
contains typical year weather files for 8 locations in India, of which one
is Bombay or Mumbai. The IWEC weather files converted for EnergyPlus are
available on the  net at
www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weatherdata_int.cfm

In addition, the raw data from NCDC (International Surface Weather
Observations) from which the IWECs were made contains six more Indian
locations, one of which is Bangalore.  This raw data consists of mostly
3-hour observations from 1982 to 1997. Work would be need to create a
typical year weather file and estimate the solar radiation.  Since I am
involved in a building energy standards project for India, I may need to
create additional typical year weather files for  these additional
locations. Let me know if you're interested and I'll keep you posted about
my progress on doing this.

Erik,

NCDC has on sale a 5 CD collection of historical weather data for 500+ US
and 800+ international weather stations called,  "International Sujrface
Weather Observations 1982-1997".  These are mostly 3-hour recordings
collected from airport broadcasts, and are the same locations selected by
ASHRAE TC 4.2 (Weather Information) for inclusion in the 1997 HOF Design
Conditions.

Among the internationa locations there are 70 Chinese locations, of which
Hohhot is included.  In 2001, a colleague and I processed some of these
Chinese weather data into TMY weather files.  I can send you the TMY weather
file we developed for Hohhot that you can sort to get a sense of the
prevailing wind directions and average wind speeds.  If you want more
information on the development of these Chinese TMY weather files, I can
send you a copy of the paper I gave at the ASHRAE conference in Honolulu in
June 2002 (Zhang, Q.Y., Huang, Y.J., and Lang, S.W. 2002. "Development of
Typical Year Weather Data for Chinese Locations", LBNL-51436. ASHRAE
Transactions, V. 108. Part 2, Honolulu).

I've typically modeled infiltration using Effective-Leakage-Areas with the LBNL Sherman-Grismrud Model rather than use Air-Changes-per-Hour. For example, a typical construction tightness would be a E-L-A of 0.0005 (ft2 openings/ft2 floor area), 0.0003 for tight construction, etc.  Using the S-G model allows me to set the E-L-As of the unconditioned spaces to their amount of vents, for which there are rules of thumb, and let the S-G model figure out the resultant air-change rates depending on temperature difference and wind speed.

  What would be a good range for the ACH of infiltration in a recently constructed home that can be considered to have a tight construction.  I am modeling the ACH for the conditioned zones to be roughly 0.5 ACH and was wondering what I should specify for the roof, garage, and basement.  My roof has a vapor retarder in it.

What would be a good range for the ACH of infiltration in a recently constructed home that can be considered to have a tight construction.  I am modeling the ACH for the conditioned zones to be roughly 0.5 ACH and was wondering what I should specify for the roof, garage, and basement.  My roof has a vapor retarder in it.

Thanks

Thanks for all these detailed references, they are indeed valuable. 

But what I need is the actual use data and not the effect of using metal bracing. I need the actual amount of steel being used by the contractors in California thru the various seismic zones. So its more a matter of a survey database rather then the actual physics. 

I guess I need to ask this question in a contractors or a structural engineers forum...

Several scientists at Oak Ridge National Lab worked with Enermodal to create
ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.7 "Energy Calculations" Report 1145 entitled
"Modeling 2 and 3 Dimensional Heat Transfer through Composite Wall and Roof
Assemblies in Hourly Energy Simulation Programs".  It essentially covers the
"Equivalent Wall Method" to analyze the steady state performance (R-value)
and transient performance of a wall system and accurately model it in say
DOE2.1 or Energy Plus which are limited by their one dimensional conduction
analysis for the building envelope.  If you are just interested in how the
metal bracing decreases the R-value, I would recommend "Thermal Breaking
Systems for Metal Stud Walls - Can Metal Stud Walls Perform as Well as Wood
Stud Walls" by some of the same researchers who worked with Energy Model on
the 1145 report mentioned above (Jan Kosny Jeffrey Christian Andre
Desjarlais)  This report covers the effect of using metal studs mainly in
residential applications but concepts can be applied to other applications
as well.  Both these publications use a Finite Difference program called
"Heating" which is very simple but robust to conduct heat transfer
calculations for pretty intricate wall assemblies.  It does both steady
state and transient analyses.  Hope this helps

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Rooftops with gas fired furnaces


We are building a small two story dormitory in Albuquerque, NM with packaged
rooftop units for each floor and exposure.
 
I am simulating per the ECB methodology and the baseline system is a PTAC
system.  However, I went ahead and created two ECB models; one with PTAC and
the other with packaged rooftops.  
 
The PTAC is modeled with hydronic heating with a natural gas fired boiler.
 
The rooftops have gas fired furnaces.
 
The PTAC's space heating energy is 5 to 6 times that of the rooftops.  Even
when simulating the PTAC with gas furnace heating, the space heating energy
is still 5 to 6 times that of the rooftops.  Space cooling usage amongst all
three models is very similar.
 
The peak heating loads are all the same for the various zones.


Has anyone had any issues modeling space heating with a gas furnaces in a
rooftops?  Basically, the space heating component is coming back
consistently with the rooftops at less than 3kbtu/sf/yr.  I believe this to
be too low.
 
Also, I can't seem to find any reports which show the Heating Input Ratio
for the gas furnaces in the rooftops...I look at the SV-A report and I see
Heating EIR which comes back as Zero all the time.  When I vary the HIR for
the rooftops, the space heating load varies slightly.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Modeling 100% OA VAV systems in eQuest (and new
EQUEST/DOE-2 versions)


The problem being asked about arises due to the different uses of the
alternative methods available in eQUEST freeware (a MS Windows
implementation
of DOE-2.2) to describe both the minimum outside air (OA) damper position
as well as the minimum flow fraction setting of the VAV boxes in each zone.

 
The min-flow-ratio for a VAVS system (DOE-2 keyword found on the SYSTEM
properties sheet, fan tab, flow parameters sub tab in the eQUEST details
mode
interface) is the minimum VAV box flow fraction for all boxes supplied by
the "parent"
air handler for the zone; this value can be specified for each individual
box or for
a system and thus "inherited" by all zone boxes supplied by the system. If
not given
a value (min flow fraction control on the mentioned subtab) defaults to the
larger of
the minimum ventilation requirement, the flow required to satisfy the zone
peak heating
load heating, or other available minimum flow specifications (such as
cfm/sqft, etc.)
In dual duct or dual fan dual duct VAV systems the boxes have many more
controls
including separate heat/cool and overall box minimum flow; consult the
DOE-2.2
dictionary (http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol2-Dictionary.pdf
<http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol2-Dictionary.pdf> ) or eQUEST
online help (although this is less complete and not as up to date) for more
detail.
 
When the outside air fraction is set to 1 this is interpreted as a minimum
ventilation
requirement and thus is found to be the maximum value of the various
defaults for
the VAV box minimum flow value.  If the minimum cfm fraction is specified
(on the
subtab mentioned above) rather than letting it default, the specified value
will be used
for all ZONE VAV boxes in that SYSTEM.
 
For example, on the system properties sheet the fan tab and flow parameters
sub tab,
you can place a value for min flow ratio, and that will become the min flow
for all VAV
boxes on the SV-A report  ...
the hourly OA fraction will then be governed by the fraction of design vs.
hourly values
choice on the system properties sheet outdoor air tab, outside air and
economizer subtab.
If (on the same properties sheet fans /flow subtab) the min flow cfm/ft2
control is set instead,
you would still get OA=1 all hours because this is one of the values
compared to the ventilation
to choose the maximum needed minimum box flow setting.  (I know the online
help is a bit
dated and poorly worded ... we are trying to get funding to improve it ...
but this information
is all there, just requires a bit of a careful read.)
 
By the way, the SV-A, and other DOE-2 reports are now easily examined: the
eQUEST
version 3.51 freeware pre-release posted on http://DOE2.com/eQUEST/
<http://DOE2.com/eQUEST/>  has a new simulation
results details viewer that allows viewing of multiple .sim files with
direct access to reports through
an index. This viewer can be used to view .sim results file produced by any
version of DOE-2.2
freeware, but is best used with versions 43 and beyond due to fully uniform
report headers (in those
versions) that the viewer uses to locate reports and error messages within a
.sim file.
 
Version 3.51 of eQUEST has many other improvements to both the simulation
engine and interface
including: a 5-10 times speed increase of project open and compliance
simulation times, an first version
of a BDL error manager to view an error tree to assist in navigation to and
fixing of model errors, and new DOE-2
simulation features that can be found documented (with other post version 40
additions) in Volume 6
of the DOE-2.2 documentation at
       http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol6-NewFeatures.pdf
<http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol6-NewFeatures.pdf> 
 
This is a pre-release to allow extensive public comment and review (followed
by our fixing issues
identified) prior to the retirement of older versions; this version has been
in wide use for some time
now (starting with version 3.50) and appears to be close to "ready for prime
time."
 
Happy simulating ...

of Hourly Flow". As far as I know, I have not set any other variables (such
as zonal settings) that might override the system settings. Please help.
Thanks,

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Hohhot wind data
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200409011202.AA0225125pd80000331779@gard.com>

I am looking for any possible information on prevailing winds in Hohhot,
China.  I've checked many, many of the usual sources and cannot find
anything - we don't even need typical year data, but even basic information
on prevailing winds for developing a design concept. 

I did locate some weather station information from
http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weatherdata/weather_requ
est.cfm, but the wind data seems unreliable, and no prevailing wind
direction is very apparent from that data.

Something as simple as a narrative describing prevailing wind conditions
would be great.  Any help would be much appreciated!

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] PLF curves for inverter units
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200409011048.AA4812500pd80000331684@gard.com>

Dear users,
 
I'm simulating a residential VAV system with TRNSYS. The air conditioner is the inverter unit RZP100DV1 of Daikin, whose minimum partial load (load/max capacity) is 31%, so the unit only cycles when PLR<0.31. How can I predict the degradation of system efficiency under these circumstances? What DOE-2 function should I use? Does somebody knows PLF functions for inverter units?
 
Thank you in advance.
