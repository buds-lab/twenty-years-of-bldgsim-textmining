Also has anyone had any experience with Meteonorm 4.0 from a Swiss company

Simulators,

My experience with Meteonorm is that you have to be careful with what it
does. I do not recommend to generate radiation data on tilted surfaces
with Meteonorm, because if have found tremendous differences to real
weather data. 

If the site you are interested in is a weather station (according to
Meteonorm), (In Version 4.0 Buenos Aires is a Meteonorm weather station)
and if you have to rely on only the most elementary quantities (e.g.
horizontal radiation, and ambient temperature), Meteonorm should yield
good results. But even in that case, differences to locally produced
reference years have been reported. Therefore, if ever you have a chance
to double check the data produced by Meteonorm, it is wise to do so. 

The hourly data generated by Meteonorm represents "typical averages" not
"typical extremes". You would have to inquire with Meteotest to find out
to what extent their format is comparable to the ones you mentioned.

A discussion in this forum about Meteonorm is appreciated. The weather
data is the basis of our work and if you think meteorologists should be
more aware of that too, you may give your input at 

http://www-helioserve.cma.fr/soda/
(There is a dash after www, not a dot.)

For those interested in European weather data this might be an
interesting site anyway.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200011151232.AA322021md80000081339@gard.com>

GenOpt(R) 1.1 has been released. GenOpt is a generic optimization
program developed by the Simulation Research Group at LBNL.

It is designed for minimization of a so-called objective function, such
as annual energy use, that is computed by an external simulation
program.

GenOpt can automatically determine the values of user-selected system
parameters such that optimal system performance is achieved. It can also
identify unknown parameters in a data-fitting process.

By modifying a configuration file, users can easily couple any external
program (like EnergyPlus, DOE-2, SPARK, BLAST, TRACE, TRNSYS, or any
user-written program with text-based input/output) to compute the
function being minimized.

GenOpt also offers an interface for implementing your own optimization
algorithms in its library.

New in version 1.1 are additional optimization algorithms for
one-dimensional and multi-dimensional optimization, an algorithm that
allows doing parametric runs on a multidimensional grid, and the ability
to process multiple function values.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] VisualSPARK 1.0 available
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200011171209.AA093176md80000081951@gard.com>

VisualSPARK 1.0 is now available from Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory. VisualSPARK allows you to build customized
models of complex physical processes by connecting calculation
objects. It is aimed at simulation of innovative building systems.

VisualSPARK features:

 * Solves nonlinear dynamic systems of arbitrary complexity --
   from a few equations up to thousands of equations

 * User-specified time step (variable time step is planned
   for Version 1.1)

 * Robust solution methods

 * HVAC component library

 * Dynamic plotting allows results to be plotted while
   simulation is running

 * Up to 20 times faster execution times than related programs
   (through use of graph-theoretic methods for problem size
   reduction)

The main elements of VisualSPARK are a USER INTERFACE, a
NETWORK SPECIFICATION LANGUAGE, a SOLVER, and a RESULTS
PROCESSOR. With the network specification language you create
calculation objects and link them into networks that
represent a building's envelope or HVAC system. The solver
solves this network for user-specified input parameters.
The results processor graphically displays the results.

VisualSPARK runs under the Windows 95/98/NT/2000, SunOS,
Solaris, Linux and HPUNIX operating systems.

VisualSPARK costs $250. To purchase the program, go to

           http://SimulationResearch.lbl.gov

If you would like to get a better idea of what the program
does before purchasing it, you can review the SPARK User's
Manual, which can be downloaded from

http://SimulationResearch.lbl.gov > SPARK > SPARK User's Manual

VisualSPARK was developed by the LBNL Simulation Research Group
and Ayres Sowell Associates, with support from the U.S.
Department of Energy, Dru Crawley, program manager.

Does anyone know the limits of PowerDOE/DOE2 for assigning zones to a
system?  I have two systems, one of which has more that 20 conditioned
zones.  Thanks.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200011221400.AA002128md80000083272@gard.com>

You have probably received several identical messages 
warning from the BLDG-SIM mailing list about a virus that 
was deleted.  You can ignore the warning messages and 
delete them.

The Details
-----------

The warning messages are from a program that we have on our 
server that checks every message with attachments to see if 
the attachments contain a virus or are unusual in any way.  
The program automatically sends a notice back to the person 
who sent the message and the recipient of the message, in 
this case the mailing list itself.  Somehow this process 
seemed to get caught in a loop and before long everyone was 
getting multiple copies of this message.  I don't know 
exactly how it happened but I changed the configuration so 
that these warning messages don't go to the recipients 
anymore.  I hope that fixes the problem.  

Jason

PS At least we didn't all get ten copies of a virus!

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] PhD studentship in indoor environment and energy in buildings modelling
 and simulation
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200011230923.AA232232md80000083481@gard.com>


(Apologies for cross-postings)

The Knowledge Center Building & Systems TNO-TU/e is offering a PhD
studentship from January 2000 for four years at Technische Universiteit
Eindhoven in The Netherlands.

The studentship includes a salary and there is no tuition fee. There
is no need to be fluent in Dutch.

The research will be in the general area of indoor environment and
energy in buildings and will focus on coupling building performance
simulation with computational fluid dynamics for design of building
and systems.



Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e) and the Netherlands Organization
for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) have recently joined forces in
research of building physics, building services and human health. A
multi-disciplinary and international approach is the cornerstone of
this endeavor that will embrace PhD students, some postdocs and visiting
professors from different countries. 

The center will generate scientific, technological and (design) process
knowledge to contribute internationally to human well-being and welfare in a
sustainable built environment. The overall theme of research is Strategic
Design Support Tools. It incorporates in-depth scientific and engineering
knowledge into new and innovative ICT-tools and knowledge to support the
design of modern buildings. The research incorporates 6 sub-themes:
building acoustics, heat and moisture, lighting, public health engineering,
renewable energy systems, and modelling and simulation.

General information for doctoral degree students at TU/e is available
at http://www.tue.nl/aiooe/English/promoveren.html


Application in the form of a curriculum vitae and two references should be
sent to doc.dr.ir. Jan Hensen not later than 15 December 2000.
For additional information applicants may contact by email: J.Hensen at tue.nl

Are the results dependable?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200011271256.AA565132md80000083935@gard.com>



I am currently working on a simple building which requires about 78 tons of
cooling (according to PowerDOE) using the actual equipment.  There are two
systems (50-ton rooftop units).  I am interested especially in the cooling
load and how some factors effect the output.  If I change the capacity on
the equipment to 80 tons, I would expect no change in the cooling coil
output (system coil).  However, I get a change proportional (maybe not quite
proportional) to the equipment size change in only one of the systems.  This
also occurs if the capacity is increased.  The other system is practically
constant (until the capacity is insufficient).  The systems are specified
identically with the exception that one that changes has some unconditioned
zones and exhaust for bathrooms.  Has anyone had a similar problem?  I would
appreciate any input.  Thanks.
