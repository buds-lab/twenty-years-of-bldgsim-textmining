When I worked on an IEA project on Low-Energy Cooling back in the late 90's,
I obtained weather files for Lisbon and Porto from Prof. Eduardo Maldanado
of the University of Porto (ebm at netcabo.pt).  I have these weather files
packed for DOE-2, but perhaps Prof. Maldanado has the files in original
ASCII.

Vitor,

Your comment about wind is very important.  We have seen
similar constructed weather files which have a constant
wind speed and direction.  And outside film coefficients are
very sensitive to this.  These two files (for Lisbon)
do have wind speed and direction which varies throughout
the year.

Hi Patricia,

It depends on what kind of climatic data you need. For most purposes the
data generated by programs such as Meteonorm or Climed may be enough.
However, you must be careful if you are using a software that calculates
the external convection coefficient based on wind speed. I once analysed
these files and found that the values for wind are not realistic
(sometimes they are even constant).

There is an official TRY file for Lisbon, with realistic wind data. I
believe that it can be obtained from the Institute of Meteorology
(www.meteo.pt) or from the INETI. For further information I suggest that
you contact Dr. Ricardo Aguiar (ricardo.aguiar at ineti.pt).

Kind regards,
Vitor Leal

About a month ago, another graduate student in Portugal was looking for
weather data for Lisbon. At the time, no one had any measured typical
year data for use in energy simulation.  I generated hourly weather data
using Meteonorm from statistics for the two stations in Lisbon...
      Lisbon/Gago Coutinho
      Lisbon/Portela

I sent these separately to Patricia.  If there are others that need this
information,
please contact me separately (not through the list).  The data are
available in
both EnergyPlus/ESP-r and TMY2 formats.

As with all statically generated weather data, you should look at it
carefully
(start by scanning the E/E STAT file) and make sure that you are
comfortable
with the data.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200410212018.AA1803281pd80000397639@gard.com>

A bit of information, but first a recap. In the last 25 years, (2004) there has been an increase in temperature conditioning by connecting the structure to ground heat.

1) Geoexchange heat pumps are well known. For more, try http://www.geoexchange.org

2) The first passive annual heat storage house is 25 years old. Built in Montana, it varies from 66 to 74 degrees Fahrenheit with no purchased power. For more, try http://earthshelters.com

3) Underground heat exchange system has been conditioning greenhouses for 22 years. For more, try http://www.sunnyjohn.com

4) Annualized Geo Solar is an active version of the PAHS system, with several improvements. For more, try http://mysite.verizon.net/res086ck/selfheatinhouses/ or search for ("self heating" AND houses).

At the last site, there is mention made of a finite element analysis program for AGS design. Presumably it could also be helpful for the other three techniques also. Someone working in this field might want to contact the author, and ask him to give BLDG-SIM a short summary.

PS There are three other known techniques for conditioning a building without petroleum.

First, make sure you are up-to-date by downloading and installing

the latest freeware eQUEST; eQUEST version 3.52 was released

last week.  This version was also submitted to the California Energy

Commission for Certification as a non-residential Title 24 Alternate

Calculation Method (ACM)   The eQUEST information page is at

       http://DOE2.com/eQUEST/ 

 

You can try using a well-water heat-pump chiller; it can be connected

to a two pipe loop and provide heat to that loop when the loop is

scheduled to be in the heating mode.  You can then use zone

baseboards connected to the two-pipe loop to do heating.

 

JJH

 

PS- Actually, D2comply version 3.52, the DOE-2.2 Title 24 compliance

"engine" within eQUEST, was submitted for certification along with

eQUEST 3.52; eQUEST was submitted as the first D2comply "derivative"

program for certification as an ACM.  Once eQUEST/D2comply 3.52 is

certified, other applications can use the certified version of D2comply

for compliance analysis and then be submitted for "fast-track" certification

since they will perform compliance analysis with an already certified tool. 

n a way, since eQUEST 3.52 contains D2comply 3.52, will be the first tool

to undergo this "fast-track" certification (although in parallel with D2comply

3.52.)  Other vendors can build DOE-2 analysis tools based on D2comply

and then go through the same process; they will, however, need to meet

all other requirements for becoming a certified ACM (such as documentation,

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] GSHP and radiant panel/baseboard questions


  I am simulating a Ground Source Heat Pump system which will provide tempered water to a radiant slab system using eQUEST v3-5.  I know that I can not use the SYSTEM TYPE HP for a radiant slab, but I am looking for reasonable work around to capture the yearly electric power consumption for this system.  I have tried dozens of different options, but I did not want to give up until I heard from the experts.  The building otherwise has typical air-to-water HP systems for ventilation and cooling (the radiant heating is intended to be disconnected from the ventilation source for comfort since this project is an elementary school) with a ground loop for heat rejection/heat.

  So far, I have not been able to attach either an FPH system (or baseboards) to the WLHP circulation loop since the WLHP loop is a condenser water loop and the FPH system (and baseboards also) can only be attached to either a hot water loop or 2-pipe loop.  Is there anyway to use or simulate a radiant exchanger on the demand side, if the plan is not to use the air-to water exchanger on the HP?   I believe that baseboards would be an acceptable substitute for a floor panel system if I could only find a way to integrate them with the condenser water circulation loop.   Is there any way to define a HW loop which is connected to the WLHP circulation loop?  I have tried to define a secondary loop, but apparently the loop type WLHP cannot have secondary loops attached. Also, would there be a way to define the length of the WLHP loop to accurately simulate heat loss from the loop? 

  Otherwise, my guess is I would have to determine the overall heat loss from the radiant loop given its physical properties and expected EWT and account for power used for the HP pump primarily and condenser operation (if at all). That would be easy to do, but I would like to know the effect that the loss would have on the rest of the WLHP circulation loop.  Is there a way to define or schedule (either within the eQUEST model or post-processing) the effect that the radiant heat loss would have on the loop temperature, especially the leaving water temperature (LWT) of the loop?  I could then determine the electric power associated with the pump (and condenser I guess) operating on the radiant system based on occupancy and some approximation of outdoor temperature reset control.   

  Any suggestions?  I could also switch to Doe2.1E v.+100 if there's a better work around there.

In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200410191040.AA4040953pd80000384211@gard.com>

Mike,
 
I carried out a field study in 1996 of whole-house air infiltration.
The study was quite extensive and examined how several different
treatments affect airtightness, but also what contribution the
components of the house (ceiling, walls, windows/doors, floor) make.
The study involved hundreds of tests of overall airtightness and
produced excellent repeatability.  We did not study the products you
mentioned but did look at wet-blown cellulose and blown fiberglass,
among others.  
 
Some of the results are fairly surprising:  the walls accounted for only
14% of leakage, and wall cavity insulation had no measurable effect on
overall tightness of the house.  In one test we removed all of the
insulation from the wall cavity and the overall infiltration increased
1.5%.  Drywall turned out to be the dominant barrier in the wall.
 
The results of the study can be found in the proceedings of the 1997
Excellence in Building Conference of the Energy Efficient Building
Association:
 "A Field Study of Whole House Air Infiltration in Residences", G.K
Yuill, Ph.D, and D.P Yuill, October 7, 1997.
 
I hope this helps.

Gary,
The VAV Design Guide that Graham mentioned discusses how to model duct
static reset control strategies using eQuest/DOE2.2.  The work includes
performance curves you can utilize to try and model a wide range of
operating conditions.  This is a great resource.  You can download it at
directly at.

Gary,
The only mechanism you have in EQuest/DOE-2.2 is to change the
FAN-EIR-FPLR, the way power input varies with flow output.  The most
appropriate curve for you application will depend on the distribution
network, location of duct static pressure sensors, pressure setpoint and
fan selection.  In simple terms constant duct static pressure will vary
flow approximately to the 1.8 to 2.2 power of flow while pressure reset
will approach a cube law as throttling losses are minimised.  The guys
at Taylor Engineering put together quite a good report on VAV systems
earlier this year which is available off the California Energy
Commission's website. Regards, Graham

As accurate as you have time to make it. It depends on how many walls,
windows and divisions you are using for each surface. As well as whether or

I am using PowerDOE to model a building with powered induction unit systems
and standard VAV terminals.  One ECM involves changing the hot water pump
from constant to variable speed.  Surprisingly, this increases the overall
energy use by more than one percent.   The pumping energy decreases as
expected, but the boiler fuel consumption increases.  Does anyone know why
this is so?   Thanks.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200410131412.AA1258140pd80000386652@gard.com>

Please participate in the second beta test of EP-Quick.  EP-
Quick is a simple program that creates an EnergyPlus input 
file.  You may use EP-Quick to create an input file for a 
building, without HVAC, using simple templates for the 
shape and zone layout. EP-Quick is not a full interface for 
EnergyPlus but simply a way to generate input files 
quickly.  

The installer may be downloaded from:

  http://www.glazersoftware.com/download.htm

To use it, press the "NEW" button and select a template and 
the types of floors. I am planning on having additional 
templates by the time it is released. Once a template is 
selected, zoning and shape are fixed but the overall 
dimension of the building can be changed.  The buildings 
are "prismatic" and are the same shape and size on all 
floors.  Windows and doors may be added and constructions 
and schedules may be modified.    

Use main "tree" interface to examine and modify the many 
different details of the building.  The main parts of the 
tree are:

The beta test will end and the beta version will stop 
working on November 15 but please send your comments to me 
a soon as possible. 

Several bugs were found in the 0.3 release and fixed for 
this 0.5 release.  

- Both IP and SI units are supported but sometimes the SI 
default values for meters in the 0.3 release were the same 
values as the IP default values for feet making them too 
large to be reasonable. New defaulting for SI has been 
included in the 0.5 release. Defaulting for IP is 
unchanged.  

- If multiple doors were described in EP-Quick version 0.3 
for the same wall, they were created using the same name 
which caused an EnergyPlus to indicate a warning. In the 
0.5 version this has been fixed.  

- If multiple windows were described in EP-Quick 0.3, a 
warning was issued by EnergyPlus due to the 
FullInteriorAndExterior solar distribution algorthim being 
specified.  Now EP-Quick 0.5 chooses the MinimalShadowing 
algorithm instead to avoid the warning.  

- Not all the building templates would allow tilted roofs 
in version 0.3. All the templates now support tilted roofs. 

In addition, a problem with roof peak heights that result 
in very shallow roofs causing a severe error when run in 
EnergyPlus 1.2 has been fixed in the EnergyPlus 1.2.1 
release.    

I'm sending this message to the BLDG-SIM mailing list, the 
EnergyPlus_Support at yahoo.com mailing list, and others so I 
apologize if you receive more than one copy.

Thanks,

Jason

Galen,

For a DOA system with heat recovery I've used a SZRH system operating at
fixed fraction OA with heat recovery. You will need to adjust the fan power
so it all works out (fan coil + DOA unit + exhaust, etc). I have gotten
decent results, though I haven't benchmarked against measured data or
anything, i.e. it has only passed my "brain test." I'd check the hourly
reports to make sure it isn't doing anything unintended. Your only problem
is if you are using 2 different cooling sources - e.g. a DX DOA unit
combined with a chilled water fan coil. For that I have no suggestions.

Regards,

Peter

I am having difficulty simulating a dedicated outside air handler in eQuest.

Kevin,

The middle floors use a multiplier and hence are not present physically in
the model.  As far as I know the only way to have the other floors show up
in the Equest graphic is for you to add them to the model and remove the
multiplier for the middle floors.  The naming convention is generally G for
ground floor, T for top floor and M for mid floors.

You can generate detailed building descriptions from wizard inputs w/ 
all floors individually modeled in version 3.51 (and later) of eQUEST.  
This new feature is only available within the Design Development wizard, 
so if your building is using the Schematic Design wizard, you will first 
have to convert it to DD.
Immediately below the fields on the first shell/envelope wizard screen 
where the user specifies the number of above/below grade floors is a new 
checkbox "Use Floor Multiplier".  Uncheck this box to generate a model 
w/ all floors individually modeled.

Dear Bldg-Sim list,

The newest version of EnergyPlus (1.2.1) was released on October 1, 2004
and is now available in versions for both the Windows and Linux operating
systems.  You can download EnergyPlus at no cost from the EnergyPlus web
site: www.energyplus.gov .

What's New in EnergyPlus Version 1.2.1
A few of the new features are listed below?see
www.energyplus.gov/features.html for a complete list of new features added
in this and previous versions:
?     Multi-sided polygons
?     Daylighting (skylight light wells, daylighting through interior
windows, translucent Glass)
?     Significant decrease in execution time for COMIS
?     Utility rate calculations
?     Ventilation load report
?     IDFEditor updates include ability to open multiple IDF files and
copy/paste objects between files
?     EP-Launch updates include ability to select a group of simulations to
run and maintaining a history of simulations
?     More than 2,000 pages of documentation
?     And speed improvements throughout.

Update on User Interfaces?
A number of graphical user interfaces for EnergyPlus are under development.
Three (DesignBuilder, EP-QUICK, EPlusInterface) are currently available in
development (beta) versions while the fourth (E+IEQ) is planned for 2005.
Watch this web page (www.energyplus.gov/ep_interfaces.html ) for up-to-date
information on these and other interfaces.

A number of utilities and tools for creating, editing, and running input
files come with EnergyPlus, including IDF Editor, EP-Launch, IFCtoIDF, and
HVAC-Diagram (see www.energyplus.gov/ep_utilities.html ). Third party tools
for creating, editing, and displaying EnergyPlus input files are also
available, including DrawBDL, EcoTect, Green Building Studio, EzDrawPlus,
TSe+, and EzPlus-Parm.  See www.energyplus.gov/third_party_tools.html for
more information.

What's going on in V1.2.1?
       Will there be any considerable difference between version 1.2.1 and
1.2.0?
       Yes.... and no. There are a number of new features and bug fixes.

       How about IDF and IDD? Do they remain unchanged?
       There will be some changes in the IDD and reflected in IDFs.
       Particularly for any new features, there will be new objects.

       Is version 1.2.1 backward compatible? Can I run a v1.2.0 file in v
1.2.1?
       For the most part, the answer is yes. Some report variables have
       changed names. To be sure, you can execute the transition program
       that will "transition" IDFs from V1.2.0 to V1.2.1. You can also view
       the ObjectStatus spreadsheet in the root folder of the installed
       version. This file has detailed explanations of changes to the
       objects.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200410041451.AA5127656pd80000375574@gard.com>

Smita, 
Your understanding of how EnergyPlus accounts for PV shading seems to be correct.  I would add that for the advanced PV models, cell performance is a function of incident radiation and that it is important to reduce this before applying the model.  With EnergyPlus, you can use single-module arrays and define separate surfaces for each module. This way the shading will be handled separately for each module.  But currently in EnergyPlus, the whole array performance would not be treated any differently than summing up each module's contribution.  You could take the output from each surface/module and reassemble the performance of the array outside of the program.   This is in general a hard thing to model as one would need a large amount of data on exactly how the modules in the array (and cells in the modules) are wired with bypass and blocking diodes.  Nowadays, clever electrical engineering can minimize the degradation effects of shading, so it isn't always the case that entire strings go dead.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] effect of partial shading on PV performance



Hi,
 
A PV related query again. This time I would like to find out if anyone can suggest an algorithm or tool that accounts for the effect of partial shading on an array. From what I understand, EnergyPlus and eQuest algorithms factor the effect of shading through adjusting the effective irradiation incident on the surface to which the array is attached. Please correct me if I am wrong in understanding this. 
 
But the effect of partial shading is quite different depending on the location of the actual cell in series. The shaded cell depending on its location in the series can degrade the performance a lot more than proportional to the % of area shaded. Can anyone confirm if any tool or algorithm takes into account his fact.
 
Any help and advise regarding this issue is appreciated.
 
Thank you,
 
 
 
PS- 
eQuest output for PV performance states that
"NOTE: PARTIAL SHADING OF A PV ARRAY CAN SEVERELY DEGRADE ITS PERFORMANCE, BUT IS NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT SEE REPORT LS-SH FOR SHADING INFORMATION"

Smita,

 

One of our recent graduates, did his Masters thesis on PV shading and
did an extensive search of design tools that could effectively model
this issue. He has just joined Kyocera Solar to continue to work in this
area. You might want to get in touch, his name is Jesse Henson

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] effect of partial shading on PV performance

 

Hi,

 

A PV related query again. This time I would like to find out if anyone
can suggest an algorithm or tool that accounts for the effect of partial
shading on an array. From what I understand, EnergyPlus and eQuest
algorithms factor the effect of shading through adjusting the effective
irradiation incident on the surface to which the array is attached.
Please correct me if I am wrong in understanding this. 

 

But the effect of partial shading is quite different depending on the
location of the actual cell in series. The shaded cell depending on its
location in the series can degrade the performance a lot more than
proportional to the % of area shaded. Can anyone confirm if any tool or
algorithm takes into account his fact.

 

Any help and advise regarding this issue is appreciated.

 

Thank you,

Thanks for the responses.
 
I want to share another response I got for this query,  which seems to go further in accounting for partial shading:

>Dear Mr. Gupta,

A friend of mine transmitted your request to me.

I have a partial answer to your question.
My software PVsyst  performs PV system simulations with partial shadings 
(3D tool).
It takes the partial shadings  on the PV array into account, in the usual 
"linear" way  (i.e. Shading loss factor proportional to the shaded area).
But you may also divide the PV array in "rectangles", each supposed to 
cover about a module string. The program computes the shading factor by 
supposing that when hitten by the shadow, the entire rectangle is 
invalidated. This is of course a rough approximation, but it gives an upper 
limit to the shading losses. The real situation should lie between these 
two values.

In practice, the shading factor applies on the beam component. The diffuse 
attenuation is calculated with the linear one, as it is not specular. 
Therefore the difference between the two values is usually not so important 
(at least under our middle-latitudes climates with 50% diffuse yearly).

You can download PVsyst from www.pvsyst.com, and use it with full 
capabilities during ten days. You will find more details in the contextual 
"help" (which may be invoked from anywhere in the software by typing F1).

Regards,

Abdr? Mermoud

NB: You may put this answer on your forum if desired. I don't have access 
to it.

eQUEST calculates the performance of a PV system assuming NO shading on the array.  It also outputs a shading report to give you an idea of how much shading the array receives over the course of the year, so that you can make a judgment regarding the impact of shading on PV performance.  eQUEST does not attempt to assess the impact of shading on PV performance for the reason you describe.  

PV degradation due to shading depends not only on how many cells in a series are shaded, but also whether that row of cells is in parallel with other rows, and how much sunlight those rows are receiving, and the characteristics of the inverter.  The interaction is complex and I am not an expert on PV systems; however my understanding is that several unshaded rows of cells can impress enough voltage across the partially-shaded rows to wipe out most of their output.

To simulate this degradation in detail would require defining the spatial geometry of each module in the array relative to the shading surface, the series/parallel relationships of the modules in the array, diodes that allow shaded cells in series to be bypassed, a description of the inverter characteristics, etc.  I am not aware of any programs that model PV systems in this detail, but would be interested in knowing whether any exist.

Thanks for all the responses.  I think that the energy code is the only
building code that is dependent on computer software to show compliance
when submitting construction documents.  It is too early for measurement
& verification.  I am not if the software available today is ready for
this.  Are we allowed to use the program that produces the most energy
savings if these programs show different results?  How about energy
savings by inadvertently entering the wrong input assuming that nobody
is checking the input in detail?

 

I have used the DOE2.1E program to show energy savings for
occupancy-based ventilation, occupancy-based lighting, under-floor air
distribution, light shelves etc. by making assumptions and adjustments
within the DOE2 program input.  For example without light shelves the
light sensor is located 5' and 10' from the window for a perimeter space
depth of 15' and with light shelves the same light sensor locations
apply to a 20' perimeter depth.  Occupancy based lighting is modeled by
reducing the prototype building lighting profile values by 20% based on
10CFR435.  Occupancy based ventilation is modeled by applying an outdoor
air ventilation profile to the system that is the design OA fraction
times the occupancy profile from loads.  Displacement ventilation is
modeled by adjusting the design space temperature - the supply air has
to maintain the summer and winter space temperatures up to 7' above the
floor and the rest of the space volume up to the ceiling is not at
design conditions.  The space temperature is the weighted average of the
lower and upper volumes of the space which means that DV saves energy
with increasing ceiling heights.  Energy savings from PV panels is based
on the total annual energy on the net PV area times the percent energy
converted as claimed by the PV manufacturer (9% to 15%).  These are just
some examples

 

LEED and Code authorities should describe standard procedures for
different types of energy saving options so that we are all on the same
playing field.  Is there an acceptable procedure for showing energy cost
savings using steam-turbine centrifugal chillers for the ECB method?

I want to correct some of the information I just put out there regarding
steam-turbine driven chillers.

 

At 150 psig, the steam temperature is about 350F, which corresponds to a
maximum thermodynamic turbine efficiency of about 30%; mechanical
efficiency would lower this.  And the steam turbines used in chillers
have better unloading characteristics than the turbines I looked at a
long time ago.  The net effect is that a steam-turbine chiller can have
about the same full load efficiency as a 2-stage absorption chiller.

	Varkie,

	 

	From my experience in modeling similar plant combinations in NYC
and using Con-Ed steam and electric rates you mentioned, for a typical
office building you will see a benefit in using steam-turbine chillers
(either option 2 and 3, depending on your electrical load factor and
refrigeration full load hours). Of course, assuming that in all the
cases you use reasonably efficient refrigeration machines.

	 

	Here is how you do it in Doe2.1:

	 

	INPUT PLANT..

	 

	ELEC-DRIVE=PLANT-EQUIPMENT

	 TYPE=HERM-CENT-CHLR

	 SIZE=24

	 INSTALLED-NUMBER=1

	 MAX-NUMBER-AVAIL=1 ..

	 

	 

	STEAM-CHILLER = PLANT-EQUIPMENT

	ABSOR2-CAP-FT=CCAPT3

	ABSOR2-HIR-FT=EIRT3

	ABSOR2-HIR-FPLR=EIRPLR3

	..

	 

	.

	.

	.

	 

	Then in PLANT PARAMETRS you specify 

	 

	ABSOR2-HIR = ?

	 

	Hope this helps.

	 

	Please let me know if you have further questions

options: (1) two 2000-ton electric-drive chillers, (2) two 2000-ton
steam-drive chillers and (3) one 2000-ton electric-drive chiller and one
2000-ton steam-drive chiller sequenced to "start first" based on ConEd
year-round steam and electric rates.  This would be for (A) a building
that operates 24 hours per day such as a hospital, and (B) an office
building that operates 7 AM - 6 PM, Mon-Fri.  I would also like to see a
life cycle cost analysis of the alternative options.  Have such studies
been done for buildings located in cities with district steam (NYC,
Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis)?

		 

		The Trane TRACE700 program (which we also use in this
office along with Carrier's HAP program) models steam-turbine chillers.
However the building in question has already been modeled in detail with
DOE2.1E using electric chillers.  I prefer to use DOE2.1E directly (we
also have eQUEST and EnergyPro in the office) for LEED certification and
to show Code compliance.  The building description language (bdl)
provides flexibility and it can be read like a specification for others
to review.  Does this program have a future?  How many A-E design firms
are using EnergyPlus on large commercial building projects?

		You would need to model it as an absorption chiller.
The chiller's heat input ratio and performance curves would need to
reflect the combination of the steam turbine and the chiller compressor.

    The Trane TRACE700 program (which we also use in this office along with Carrier's HAP program) models steam-turbine chillers.  However the building in question has already been modeled in detail with DOE2.1E using electric chillers.  I prefer to use DOE2.1E directly (we also have eQUEST and EnergyPro in the office) for LEED certification and to show Code compliance.  The building description language (bdl) provides flexibility and it can be read like a specification for others to review.  Does this program have a future?  How many A-E design firms are using EnergyPlus on large commercial building projects?

    You would need to model it as an absorption chiller.  The chiller's heat input ratio and performance curves would need to reflect the combination of the steam turbine and the chiller compressor.

      Has anyone modeled steam turbine drive centrifugal chillers with DOE2.1E?  Is it possible to add this equipment to DOE2, given the part load performance data?

specific energie in office buildingsVarkie and Konstantine,

I am not sure this example goes far enough, for a couple of reasons.  Note, however, that I am not an expert on steam turbines, and that last time I looked at this issue was over 10 years ago.  Hopefully, other people can contribute better information:

1)  It is my understanding that the efficiency of a steam turbine degrades markedly when you throttle the steam to unload the turbine.  If so, then the part-load performance of a steam-turbine centrifugal will degrade significantly during most hours of operation, and custom temperature and PLR curves must be used to model this effect.  Default DOE-2 curves would not suffice.

2)  What pressure steam is available?  If 150 psig, then the maximum thermodynamic efficiency of the turbine is less than 10% (I don't recall the exact figure anymore), and the mechanical efficiency is only about half of that.  And at 50% part load, the efficiency is considerably less than at full load.  

3)  On an annual basis, a 150 psig steam turbine would be less than 5% efficient.  Coupled with a chiller COP = 5, the annual COP of the combination would be less than 0.25.  In comparison, a single-stage absorption chiller has a COP of about 0.7, and a two-stage absorption chiller has a COP of about 1.2.  So, unless there is a use for the waste heat, this type of chiller will consume quite a bit of energy, and I don't see how it could be cost effective.
 
Before analyzing this problem any further using an energy simulation program, I suggest researching the performance of a steam turbine at the available steam pressure, and then doing some back-of-the-envelope calculations to determine whether the effort of a detailed analysis is worth it.  If the detailed analysis is justified, DOE-2 does have a steam turbine electric generator algorithm.  You might start with the performance curves contained in that algorithm.

  Varkie,

   

  From my experience in modeling similar plant combinations in NYC and using Con-Ed steam and electric rates you mentioned, for a typical office building you will see a benefit in using steam-turbine chillers (either option 2 and 3, depending on your electrical load factor and refrigeration full load hours). Of course, assuming that in all the cases you use reasonably efficient refrigeration machines.

   

  Here is how you do it in Doe2.1:

   

  INPUT PLANT..

   

  ELEC-DRIVE=PLANT-EQUIPMENT

   TYPE=HERM-CENT-CHLR

   SIZE=24

   INSTALLED-NUMBER=1

   MAX-NUMBER-AVAIL=1 ..

   

   

  STEAM-CHILLER = PLANT-EQUIPMENT

  TYPE = ABSOR2-CHLR

  SIZE = 24

  MAX-NUMBER-AVAIL=1 ..

  ..

   

  EQUIPMENT-QUAD

  ABSOR2-CAP-FT=CCAPT3

  ABSOR2-HIR-FT=EIRT3

  ABSOR2-HIR-FPLR=EIRPLR3

  ..

   

  .

  .

  .

   

  Then in PLANT PARAMETRS you specify 

   

  ABSOR2-HIR = ?

  Hope this helps.

  Please let me know if you have further questions

    Steve:



    I received other responses suggesting the same thing:



    1. Use 2 stage absorption chiller with HIR of the turbine

    2. Assign PLR curves of centrifugal chiller to corresponding curves of absorption machine.



    I assume this will produce reasonably accurate steam consumption of the steam-turbine.  I need a sample DOE2 Plant "inp" or "bdl" statements showing how to do this.  The chillers in question are York model YST.  York will provide the performance data.  The location is NYC and the utility rates are ConEd Steam Service Classification 2 (lower rates in summer) and ConEd Electric Service Classification 9 Rate II - General Large Time of Use 



    http://q050-www5.coned.com/es/tariffs/ps.asp?URL=tariffs.htm&s=tariffs



    Since there are several buildings in NYC that use a hybrid plant of steam-turbine and electric-motor drive chillers, I assume studies have already been done justifying this combination.  So far I have found the ASHRAE Sept 2003 article: Advances in Steam Cooling by Ian Spanswick



    I would like to compare the following alternative options: (1) two 2000-ton electric-drive chillers, (2) two 2000-ton steam-drive chillers and (3) one 2000-ton electric-drive chiller and one 2000-ton steam-drive chiller sequenced to "start first" based on ConEd year-round steam and electric rates.  This would be for (A) a building that operates 24 hours per day such as a hospital, and (B) an office building that operates 7 AM - 6 PM, Mon-Fri.  I would also like to see a life cycle cost analysis of the alternative options.  Have such studies been done for buildings located in cities with district steam (NYC, Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis)?
