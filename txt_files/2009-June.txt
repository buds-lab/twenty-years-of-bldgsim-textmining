Hi Peter,
 
Thanks for your reply on the matter. I have began looking a little at TRNSYS, and from what you are describing about its air movement analysis, it sounds tempting to use this program for the dynamic simulation. How does TRNSYS model the temperature stratification in the atrium? Can it predict the air flow if the solar gain is "captured" by interior screens at the top of the atrium, (which thereby adds to the air movement at this location) instead of the solar gain being added near the walls and floors by tracking the solar irradiation? What about diffuse radiation? In short: What is your experience using TRNSYS? Can it do what you want it to do? What about stratification?
 
My client expects presentation of results regarding temperature in the occupied zone as well as air velocity. However I will not make a CFD stating that the air velocity on the occupied zone is 0,1435 m/s (...which is shown in this CFD calculation etc. ...) because the calculation is only steady state and is not valid for a whole year, because of the uncertainties in the input in the CFD calculations. Moreover I can't present the results from the thermal calculations as these are very uncertain due to the uncertainty about stratification in the atria. Can TRNSYS take care of these problems? 
 
I would rather not make more than 4 CFD simulations, and the simulations should have the necessary input from TRNSYS in order to achieve the correct results more or less in the first simulation. What's your comment on transient simulation? Is it worthwhile? From what I know of these simulations, the computing time is more or less the same as the results are based on the constant boundary conditions and is therefore only showing the uncertainties in the solving of the different differential equations. The results presented in the transient calculations can then be used to illustrate the variation of the results... or can it?
 
The CFD calculations are extremely expensive and if it is to be of any use for any client the uncertainties should also be presented. Your efforts on LA courthouse confirms that CFD is expensive. When was this work done? What was the tasks on this building? It would be nice if I could glance at the papers you made at that time. 
 
I haven't been able to find the program "ROOM"? Do you have a link? Thanks for your help.

Frederik, I have worked on a couple of large atrium projects over the years. You did ask for comments and suggestions so here goes:

You need a tool that can predict conditions in a quite complicated space and looking at you location you will have two major problems:

1.	downdraft and cold radiation during the winter 
2.	high radiation surface and possible stratification during the summer. 

 

I model the space with ROOM (ARUP Rand D, Mike Holmes and Andrew White) or lately TRNSYS. This enables me to set up heat balances and run fairly quickly (once the models have been built), and provide what if scenarios for both summer and winter. ROOM enables me to look at radiation exchange in the space and occupant comfort, as well as stratification. TRNSYS will allow analysis of air movement within the space, this is especially important when heating the space in winter.

Once these have been completed you can step to CFD (Colours for Directors), at this point I will probably get shot down, but most of the CFD programs I know are steady state, so for one moment in time. The next problem is the complexity of the space, the grids and the number of cells all of which increase the validity of the results and drastically increase computational time. For example CFD runs for the atrium in the LA courthouse were between 56 to 72 hours each.

I think you need to work out what results you require and the level of accuracy of these results. Is this a design problem or an academic project?

We published a paper on temperatures and bulk air movement for a large atrium in a hospital in the Netherlands, which had a large glazed roof and numerous openings, this was about 15 years ago and is published in ASHRAE transactions. I also presented a paper on a large atrium/shopping mall in Warsaw at the opening of DTU new labs in 2001. The LA courthouse data has never been published as it is the property of the client, but I may be able to find some of the results for you. To give you some idea of the costs and time involved for this particular analysis, the CFD analysis alone was in the order of $120,000 and our effort, temperature, air movement, thermal comfort and stratification as well as writing a report, that could be understood by the client another $240,000 and we didn't make any profit.

I hope this helps, if not let me know what else you need, good luck.

Hi, 

I am currently starting up on simulating a relatively large atrium in Denmark (app. 55?N) with a glazed roof (sloped towards the sun - clever), open balconies with working areas connected to the atrium, as well as a smaller atrium with smaller openings connecting the two atria together with each other. The main focus in the simulation is first of all the air velocity and temperature distribution in the occupied zone and on the balconies - describing the thermal comfort as well as draft rate. The next focus is on integrating the smaller atria as a heat exchanger in winter time as well as analyzing if this can be used for cooling in summer time, transporting the air from outside to the biggest atrium, via the smaller atrium with little heating of the air. The calculations I want to perform in CFD also regards simulations of the solar gain in the biggest atrium. However simulating radiation in CFD simulations require more computing power for bigger rooms with a lot of surfaces. Any advice on simulating solar gain in CFD? How can this dynamic gain be simulated in CFD? Another cool thing in this atrium would be the heat recovery of the extracted air in the top part of the atrium.

Simulating this in a thermal simulation software requires a lot of luck to obtain the correct (and true) result in the first couple of simulations. However I am thinking of integrating the results from a CFD calculation into the thermal simulation. I am thinking of doing this as an iterative process, integrating the results from CFD when needed in the thermal simulations. This will probably result in at least 4 different simulations over a whole year, giving detailed results (temperature gradient, flow between zones, convective heat-transfer coefficients etc.) which can be used in the thermal simulation for these 4 periods over a year. As mentioned above simulating radiation in CFD is tough, I am thinking of leaving this calculation in the thermal simulation.

Another simpler setup would be the integration of a multi-zone calculation in the thermal simulation giving a more coarse result of the main flow route in the atrium and mixing between balconies and the atrium. However these results could potentially give the same detailed results I am looking for.

Finally has any one worked on an uncertainty analysis of these coupling methods illustrating first of all the uncertainty in the results as well as the sensitivity in the input parameters?

Has anyone done something like this before and what tools were used? I have been given free hands with regards to choice of software so any feedback on this subject will be useful. I'm really looking forward to hear from you :-)

Hi Paul,
 
Thanks for your reply. I haven't heard about DesignBuilder CFD before and I have only heard and peaked to EnergyPlus. EnergyPlus seems OK for simulating multizones and thermal simulations. Do you know how it handles stratification? I am thinking of using thermal simulations, with a good link to a multizone program so that the 2 programs can predict the air movement as well as the stratification in the room. I am then thinking of doing 4 CFD studies and these simulations should have input from the thermal simulation. The output from the CFD simulations should then be compared to the results from the thermal simulation. The two calculations should therefor be reasonably comparable (in the end).
 
I think that the use LES turbulence model for indoor climate analysis is rather hazardous because this turbulence model is mostly used for fire and smoke simulations. I have obtained good results for indoor climate using ke-turbulence model. Is my thought "out of date" on this point? Does ke-turbulence model also work for larger rooms? When can/should LES-turbulence model be used, apart from smoke/fire simulations? The problem is also getting a thermal simulation program, which can import the results from a CFD calculation. 
 
Using the transient calculations could prove very useful in showing the uncertainty in the CFD calculations. However, can I, when importing the boundary conditions from the thermal simulation to the CFD simulation, import the temperature stratefication as a start condition for the simulation? What is your experience on coupling thermal/multizone simulations with CFD calculations? Does it work? It could be very useful if the CFD calculation starts with the same boundary conditions and results from the thermal simulation, rather than starting from scratch every time a CFD analysis has to be performed.
 
Do you know of any papers dealing with modeling of solar gain in CFD tools?

Hi Frederik,

 

DesignBuilder CFD would allow you to come up with an EnergyPlus multizone air flow linked thermal simulation coupled with a steady state CFD solution.  This has recently been released and is a cost-effective way of linking the 2.  If you used DesignBuilder to develop the energy model/Steady State CFD solution carried out and then use their model export options to give you the model upon which to then import it into a more complex transient CFD tool should it be necessary.  To some extent you could argue whether or not you need the transient analysis as the dynamic simulations should give you the temporal solution for the airflow and then you could look at what happens for say peak or mean flow conditions perhaps.  But I'd suggest that it might well be worth it from what you are describing as even a well set up thermal multizone model would do most of what you describe, but the thermal stratification issues are going to be a sticking point for most simulation tools, both Dynamic or CFD to some extent.

 

If you really wanted to see the time effects of the Solar Gain on airflows, etc, there are many CFD tools available that would be able to do this, obviously all the major CFD engines would do this comfortably (Airpak from Ansys Fluent most easily I suspect with its integrated solar gain modelling tool) but they are going to be quite expensive and there is quite a learning curve to some of them.

 

Alternatively, you could use something like PyroSim, which is a good front end for NIST that would probably be suitable.  NIST does transient analysis and is used commonly for smoke/fire analysis.  It uses LES turbulence models from memory and so would be likely to be more accurate for the sort of stratified flows you'd get in an Atria as well.  You could then set transient boundaries based on files of data exported by the dynamic engine.  Might take a bit of work, but it should work.

 

Regards

Paul

Dear Building Energy Simulators,



We are holding a 2-Day DesignBuilder/EnergyPlus
 ?advanced? building energy simulation workshop  at Pacific Energy
Center, downtown San Francisco on Wednesday and Thursday, 17 ? 18 June 2009.
The workshop is being lead by Dr Mahabir Bhandari of DesignBuilder Software
(USA) and PC Thomas of Team Catalyst Pty Ltd (Australia). Both personnel have
extensive experience in the use and teaching of building energy simulation
programs. Participants will use the DesignBuilder/EnergyPlus suite extensively
over the two days. Dr Tian ZhenHong from DOE/LBNL will be provide a brief overview on the new and upcoming features in EnergyPlus!

Day1
will be focused on developing building geometry with DesignBuilder, importing
from 2D-DXF and 3D gbXML import from CAD.  The building envelope will be
optimised by studying zoning, efficient glazing, insulated construction
systems, window shading to study the impact on load calculation and predicted
PMV.
Day2
will be focused on modelling systems using EnergyPlus.  A simple
5-zone model will be exported from DesignBuilder to EnergyPlus.  The
native IDF Editor will be used to develop HVAC Template options to generate a
VAV system.  A series of HVAC design upgrades will be tested.  These
could include, adding AHUs, supply air reset control, VSD drives, low turn down
ratios, low static pressure ductwork, or upgrading air cooled to water cooled
plant.  
This
workshop is a great opportunity for training staff in predicting the
energy/greenhouse performance of buildings.  These skills would be invaluable
in the current tough economic climate juxtaposed with increasing concern about
global warming.  Projects that do proceed, either new or renovation, will
have an increased focus on sustainable performance.  We look forward to
meeting with you at the workshop.  Seats are limited so please confirm your place quickly.

Best
regards, 


Mahabir Bhandari and PC Thomas

Excuse cross-postings .

 

 

ShadingII - Release

I'm glad to announce the release of ShadingII, a new plugin for sketchUP.

 

The plugin comprises a series of functions/utilities for
evaluating/assessing the Geometrical Shading Coefficient (GSC) of any
surface(s) selected from the 3D model (i.e. open space, roof, facade,
window).

 

Among those functions I can mention:

-. GSC calculation for current date and time.

-. GSC calculation for a predetermined or user defined period of time (via
csv output file).

-. Calculating the potential visibility percentage of any selected surface
from the current point of view.

-. Show a view from the sun's point of view.

-. Free or system selection of surfaces according to layer,
opaqueness/translucence, azimuth and slope angle, for assessment.

 

I invite you to download and try it at:

http://ayezioro.technion.ac.il/Downloads/ShadingII/ 

Uncompress in the plugins directory and enjoy.

 

-A.

Message-ID: <69a9bc0a0906020906p3824c30aw46d6f4361817da4c@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm working on a project that is using line-voltage track lighting.  They
have specified 4-watt LED fixtures.  Section 9 of ASHRAE specifies that for
line-voltage track lighting the installed lighting shall be a minimum of 30
w/linear foot.  With the fixtures specified, I don't think we could even
*fit* 30 w/sf on the tracks.  Has anyone received a variance for this
requirement for LEED EA Credit 1?  We may try to argue that we should use
the maximum wattage that could fit on the tracks, given the fixture choice,
but we would really like to use the wattage of the actual installed
fixtures.

Thanks,

Karen

Frederik,

I have done bigger building than this. You need to run two worst?cases,?cooling and heating. You will see the stratification in cooling case and possible down draft (or no) in heating. The critical part of your problem is the radiation. You need to include this effect for sure. As for the turbulence model, I recommend you to use indoor zero equation. 

Thanks

Hi Peter,
?
Thanks for your reply on the matter. I have began looking a little at TRNSYS, and from what you are describing about its air movement analysis, it sounds tempting to use this program for the dynamic simulation. How does TRNSYS model the temperature stratification in the atrium? Can it predict the air flow if the solar gain is "captured" by interior screens at the top of the atrium, (which thereby adds to the air movement at this location) instead of the solar gain being added near the walls?and floors?by tracking the solar irradiation? What about diffuse radiation? In short: What is your experience using TRNSYS? Can it do what you want it to do? What about stratification?
?
My client expects presentation of results regarding temperature in the occupied zone as well as air velocity. However I will not make a CFD stating that the air velocity on the occupied zone is 0,1435 m/s (...which is shown in this CFD calculation etc. ...) because the calculation is only steady state and is not valid for a whole year, because of the uncertainties in the input in the CFD calculations. Moreover I can't present the results from the thermal calculations as these are very uncertain due to the uncertainty about stratification in the atria. Can TRNSYS take care of these problems? 
?
I would rather not make more than 4 CFD simulations, and the simulations should have the necessary input from TRNSYS in order to achieve the correct results more or less in the first simulation. What's your comment on transient simulation? Is it worthwhile? From what I know of these simulations, the computing time is more or less the same as the results are based on the constant boundary conditions and is therefore only showing the uncertainties in the solving of the different differential equations. The results presented in the transient calculations can then be used to illustrate the variation of the results... or can it?
?
The CFD calculations are extremely expensive and if it is to be of any use for any client the uncertainties should also be presented. Your efforts on LA courthouse confirms that CFD is expensive. When was this work done? What was the tasks on this building? It would be nice if I could glance at the papers you made at that time. 
?
I haven't been able to find the program "ROOM"? Do you have a link? Thanks for your help.
?

Frederik, I have worked on a couple of large atrium projects over the years. You did ask for comments and suggestions so here goes:
You need a tool that can predict conditions in a quite complicated space and looking at you location you will have two major problems:
	1. downdraft and cold radiation during the winter 
	2. high radiation surface and possible stratification during the summer. 
?
I model the space with ROOM (ARUP Rand D, Mike Holmes and Andrew White) or lately TRNSYS. This enables me to set up heat balances and run fairly quickly (once the models have been built), and provide what if scenarios for both summer and winter. ROOM enables me to look at radiation exchange in the space and occupant comfort, as well as stratification. TRNSYS will allow analysis of air movement within the space, this is especially important when heating the space in winter.
Once these have been completed you can step to CFD (Colours for Directors), at this point I will probably get shot down, but most of the CFD programs I know are steady state, so for one moment in time. The next problem is the complexity of the space, the grids and the number of cells all of which increase the validity of the results and drastically increase computational time. For example CFD runs for the atrium in the LA courthouse were between 56 to 72 hours each.
I think you need to work out what results you require and the level of accuracy of these results. Is this a design problem or an academic project?
We published a paper on temperatures and bulk air movement for a large atrium in a hospital in the Netherlands , which had a large glazed roof and numerous openings, this was about 15 years ago and is published in ASHRAE transactions. I also presented a paper on a large atrium/shopping mall in Warsaw at the opening of DTU new labs in 2001. The LA courthouse data has never been published as it is the property of the client, but I may be able to find some of the results for you. To give you some idea of the costs and time involved for this particular analysis, the CFD analysis alone was in the order of $120,000 and our effort, temperature, air movement, thermal comfort and stratification as well as writing a report, that could be understood by the client another $240,000 and we didn?t make any profit.
I hope this helps, if not let me know what else you need, good luck.

Hi,
I am currently starting up on simulating a relatively large atrium in Denmark (app. 55?N) with a glazed roof (sloped towards the sun - clever), open balconies with working areas connected to the atrium, as well as a smaller atrium with smaller openings connecting the two atria together with each other.The main focus in the simulation is first of all the air velocity and temperature distribution in the occupied zone and on the balconies - describing the thermal comfort as well as draft rate. The next focus is on integrating the smaller atria as a heat exchanger in winter time as well as analyzing if this can be used for cooling in summer time, transporting the air from outside to the biggest atrium, via the smaller atrium with little heating of the air. The calculations I want to perform in CFD also regards simulations of the solar gain in the biggest atrium. However simulating radiation in CFD simulations require more computing power for bigger rooms
 with a lot of surfaces. Any advice on simulating solar gain in CFD? How can this dynamic gain be simulated in CFD? Another cool thing in this atrium would be the heat recovery of the extracted air in the top part of the atrium.
Simulating this in a thermal simulation software requires a lot of luck to obtain the correct (and true) result in the first couple of simulations. However I am thinking of integrating the results from a CFD calculation into the thermal simulation. I am thinking of doing this as an iterative process, integrating the results from CFD when needed in the thermal simulations. This will probably result in at least 4 different simulations over a whole year, giving detailed results (temperature gradient, flow between zones, convective heat-transfer coefficients etc.) which can be used in the thermal simulation for these 4 periods over a year. As mentioned above simulating radiation in CFD is tough, I am thinking of leaving this calculation in the thermal simulation.
Another simpler setup would be the integration of a multi-zone calculation in the thermal simulation giving a more coarse result of the main flow route in the atrium and mixing between balconies and the atrium. However these results could potentially give the same detailed results I am looking for.
Finally has any one worked on an uncertainty analysis of these coupling methods illustrating first of all the uncertainty in the results as well as the sensitivity in the input parameters?
Has anyone done something like this before and what tools were used? I have been given free hands with regards to choice of software so any feedback on this subject will be useful. I'm really looking forward to hear from you :-)
Kind regards

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling chillers at non-standard operating conditions
	as per Appendix G
Message-ID: <3EC944427F87D84793DBBC4137A2B5ADEFCB33@to1exc02wp.halsall.com>

Hello All,
 
I have a question regarding the minimum centrifugal chiller efficiencies for conditions not covered by ASHRAE 90.1-2004 section 6.4.1.2.  Specifically, I'm trying to model a chiller for a building in a hot humid climate.  The specified operating conditions for the condenser EWT are 95?F (35?C), which is beyond the range of conditions covered by ASHRAE.
 
In this case, what should I use for the minimum chiller efficiency in my reference building?  Do I still have to follow Appendix G section G3.1.3.11 which states that my condenser supply temp shall be the lower of 84?F (29?C) or 10?F (5.6?C) approach to design wet-bulb.  The wet-bulb in this climate is 86?F (30?C), so the 10?F approach is therefore 96?F, which means my condenser supply temp (EWT) shall be 84?F (29?C), the lower of the two.  At this condenser EWT, the minimum ASHRAE efficiencies from Table 6.8.1J vary depending on condenser flow.  Since condenser flow is not specified by Appendix G, should I simply used the Kadj equations at the bottom of that table?  If that's the case, the condenser DT is 15?F (8?C) and the Lift is 41?F (22.7?C) and I arrive at an adjustment factor Kadj of 0.88.  Applied to my standard COP of 6.1, I get a COP of 5.4.  
 
My issue with this approach is that this COP is very difficult to achieve at our operating conditions.  In my opinion, this is an unfair comparison for chillers in very hot humid climates since Appendix G is prescribing operating conditions which are considerably more "temperate" than the extreme conditions under which our chillers will operate.  We can realistically achieve a COP of 5.1.  In this climate, cooling is a dominant load, yet due to Appendix G "rules", it will be very difficult to meet the LEED energy prerequisite, since our chiller are worse than reference.
 
Finally, I'm assuming that since ASHRAE does not cover this operating range, I don't have to worry about meeting the mandatory provisions for efficiency listed in Tables 6.8.1H, I and J in my proposed building, ie there is no minimum chiller efficiency for this range.
 
Any help in this matter would be much appreciated.  If I've missed something in my calculations or wasn't clear enough, please let me know because this issue is a big concern to our project.
 
Many thanks,

Hi Paul,
?
Thanks for your reply. I haven't heard about DesignBuilder CFD before and I have only heard and peaked to EnergyPlus. EnergyPlus seems OK for simulating multizones and thermal simulations. Do you know how it handles stratification? I am thinking of using thermal simulations, with a good link to a multizone program so that the 2 programs can predict the air movement as well as the stratification in the room. I am then thinking of doing 4 CFD studies and these simulations should have input from the thermal simulation. The output from the CFD simulations should then be compared to the results from the thermal simulation. The two calculations should therefor be reasonably comparable (in the end).
?
DesignBuilder just released v2. I'm not quite familiar with its CFD module, but I believe DB was mainly used with E+. If you want to achieve stratification, you have to use some CFD package. E+ has a DV module which may have stratification feature, but that's only for DV. 
?
I think that the use LES turbulence model for indoor climate analysis is rather hazardous because this turbulence model is mostly used for fire and smoke simulations. I have obtained good results for indoor climate using ke-turbulence model. Is my thought "out of date" on this point? Does ke-turbulence model also work for larger rooms? When can/should LES-turbulence model be used, apart from smoke/fire simulations??The problem is also getting a thermal simulation program, which can import the results from a CFD calculation. 
?
Using the transient calculations could prove very useful in showing the uncertainty in the CFD calculations. However, can I, when importing the boundary conditions from the thermal simulation to the CFD simulation, import the temperature stratefication as a start condition for the simulation? What is your experience on coupling thermal/multizone simulations with CFD calculations? Does it work? It could be very useful if the CFD calculation starts with the same boundary conditions and results from the thermal simulation, rather than starting from scratch every time a CFD analysis has to be performed.
?
I'm not sure the exact meaning of your "thermal simulation". If you refer to the mechanical load calculation software, eg. Trane trace or other heating/cooling software, the answer is yes. You can calculate the heat flux at the exterior wall/roof/floor and then import them into your CFD model. But you need to verify the CFD result carefully since the setpoint may be different from the result of your CFD modeling. This could cause some inaccurate result.
?
Do you know of any papers dealing with modeling of solar gain in CFD tools?

?

Hi Frederik,
?
DesignBuilder CFD would allow you to come up with an EnergyPlus multizone air flow linked thermal simulation coupled with a steady state CFD solution.? This has recently been released and is a cost-effective way of linking the 2.? If you used DesignBuilder to develop the energy model/Steady State CFD solution carried out and then use their model export options to give you the model upon which to then import it into a more complex transient CFD tool should it be necessary.? To some extent you could argue whether or not you need the transient analysis as the dynamic simulations should give you the temporal solution for the airflow and then you could look at what happens for say peak or mean flow conditions perhaps.? But I?d suggest that it might well be worth it from what you are describing as even a well set up thermal multizone model would do most of what you describe, but the thermal stratification issues are going to be a sticking point for most
 simulation tools, both Dynamic or CFD to some extent.
?
If you really wanted to see the time effects of the Solar Gain on airflows, etc, there are many CFD tools available that would be able to do this, obviously all the major CFD engines would do this comfortably (Airpak from Ansys Fluent most easily I suspect with its integrated solar gain modelling tool) but they are going to be quite expensive and there is quite a learning curve to some of them.
?
Alternatively, you could use something like PyroSim, which is a good front end for NIST that would probably be suitable.? NIST does transient analysis and is used commonly for smoke/fire analysis.? It uses LES turbulence models from memory and so would be likely to be more accurate for the sort of stratified flows you?d get in an Atria as well.? You could then set transient boundaries based on files of data exported by the dynamic engine.? Might take a bit of work, but it should work.

Hi Ding,
 
With regards to importing the boundary conditions from the dynamic (thermal) simulation, how do you take building mass into account. Some of the external conditions i absorbed by the floors and walls. Can you get the CFD calculations to take this factor into account when using CFD? I haven't heard of this before. 
 
Also the CFD results are only a predicted airflow and are extremely sensitive to input parameters, and the flow is more or less steady state. Therefore the CFD can only be used to illustrate what could possibly happen, and to get an idea of the stratefication. However as you mention with regards to stratefication, I need a dynamic simulation which can calculate stratefication relatively simple so that the stratefication would vary over time. E+ sounds like a possibility, but if it only can calculate stratefication when using displacement ventilation, then it becomes less attractive to use. Do you know of any other software which can calculate stratefication? The Danish program BSim has a fixed parameter for stratification so this program can not be used for calculation over a whole year unless the calculation is divided up into smaller parts, and the stratefication is changed manually, based on CFD calculations.
 
I agree with you that it is important to include radiation! However it takes longer to obtain convergance with this module "on". How do you manage to calculate large rooms with many surfaces, and still including radiation? Clustering of (many) computers?

I have obtained good results for indoor climate using ke-turbulence model. Is my thought "out of date" on this point? Does ke-turbulence model also work for larger rooms? When can/should LES-turbulence model be used, apart from smoke/fire simulations? The problem is also getting a thermal simulation program, which can import the results from a CFD calculation. 
 
Using the transient calculations could prove very useful in showing the uncertainty in the CFD calculations. However, can I, when importing the boundary conditions from the thermal simulation to the CFD simulation, import the temperature stratefication as a start condition for the simulation? What is your experience on coupling thermal/multizone simulations with CFD calculations? Does it work? It could be very useful if the CFD calculation starts with the same boundary conditions and results from the thermal simulation, rather than starting from scratch every time a CFD analysis has to be performed.
 
I'm not sure the exact meaning of your "thermal simulation". If you refer to the mechanical load calculation software, eg. Trane trace or other heating/cooling software, the answer is yes. You can calculate the heat flux at the exterior wall/roof/floor and then import them into your CFD model. But you need to verify the CFD result carefully since the setpoint may be different from the result of your CFD modeling. This could cause some inaccurate result.
 
Do you know of any papers dealing with modeling of solar gain in CFD tools?

Hi Frederik,

 

DesignBuilder CFD would allow you to come up with an EnergyPlus multizone air flow linked thermal simulation coupled with a steady state CFD solution.  This has recently been released and is a cost-effective way of linking the 2.  If you used DesignBuilder to develop the energy model/Steady State CFD solution carried out and then use their model export options to give you the model upon which to then import it into a more complex transient CFD tool should it be necessary.  To some extent you could argue whether or not you need the transient analysis as the dynamic simulations should give you the temporal solution for the airflow and then you could look at what happens for say peak or mean flow conditions perhaps.  But I'd suggest that it might well be worth it from what you are describing as even a well set up thermal multizone model would do most of what you describe, but the thermal stratification issues are going to be a sticking point for most simulation tools, both Dynamic or CFD to some extent.

 

If you really wanted to see the time effects of the Solar Gain on airflows, etc, there are many CFD tools available that would be able to do this, obviously all the major CFD engines would do this comfortably (Airpak from Ansys Fluent most easily I suspect with its integrated solar gain modelling tool) but they are going to be quite expensive and there is quite a learning curve to some of them.

 

Alternatively, you could use something like PyroSim, which is a good front end for NIST that would probably be suitable.  NIST does transient analysis and is used commonly for smoke/fire analysis.  It uses LES turbulence models from memory and so would be likely to be more accurate for the sort of stratified flows you'd get in an Atria as well.  You could then set transient boundaries based on files of data exported by the dynamic engine.  Might take a bit of work, but it should work.

 

Regards

Paul

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Links between CFD or MZ and thermal simulations for simulating air and temperature distributions in atria

 

Hi, 

I am currently starting up on simulating a relatively large atrium in Denmark (app. 55?N) with a glazed roof (sloped towards the sun - clever), open balconies with working areas connected to the atrium, as well as a smaller atrium with smaller openings connecting the two atria together with each other. The main focus in the simulation is first of all the air velocity and temperature distribution in the occupied zone and on the balconies - describing the thermal comfort as well as draft rate. The next focus is on integrating the smaller atria as a heat exchanger in winter time as well as analyzing if this can be used for cooling in summer time, transporting the air from outside to the biggest atrium, via the smaller atrium with little heating of the air. The calculations I want to perform in CFD also regards simulations of the solar gain in the biggest atrium. However simulating radiation in CFD simulations require more computing power for bigger rooms with a lot of surfaces. Any advice on simulating solar gain in CFD? How can this dynamic gain be simulated in CFD? Another cool thing in this atrium would be the heat recovery of the extracted air in the top part of the atrium.

Simulating this in a thermal simulation software requires a lot of luck to obtain the correct (and true) result in the first couple of simulations. However I am thinking of integrating the results from a CFD calculation into the thermal simulation. I am thinking of doing this as an iterative process, integrating the results from CFD when needed in the thermal simulations. This will probably result in at least 4 different simulations over a whole year, giving detailed results (temperature gradient, flow between zones, convective heat-transfer coefficients etc.) which can be used in the thermal simulation for these 4 periods over a year. As mentioned above simulating radiation in CFD is tough, I am thinking of leaving this calculation in the thermal simulation.

Another simpler setup would be the integration of a multi-zone calculation in the thermal simulation giving a more coarse result of the main flow route in the atrium and mixing between balconies and the atrium. However these results could potentially give the same detailed results I am looking for.

Finally has any one worked on an uncertainty analysis of these coupling methods illustrating first of all the uncertainty in the results as well as the sensitivity in the input parameters?

Has anyone done something like this before and what tools were used? I have been given free hands with regards to choice of software so any feedback on this subject will be useful. I'm really looking forward to hear from you :-)

Kind regards

Dear colleagues,

 

This is a reminder/invitation that we will be hosting a three day
Executive Education Program on 'Daylighting Buildings' on June 29/30 and
July 10 at Harvard University, Graduate School of Design
(http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=1
01683) . The workshop has been specifically designed for A&E and
consulting firms interested in adding advanced daylighting analysis
techniques to their portfolio. The first two days of the workshop will
consist of presentations and hands-on exercises. On the third day, which
will take place about a week later, we will reconvene either in person
or electronically, and participants will be asked to present an example
of how they applied the course content to a project of their choice. The
class and instructors will review the results and provide constructive
feedback. The main purpose of that third day is to 'force' participants
to apply what they have learnt shortly after the workshop so that they
do not forget the course content and start feeling more confident about
their simulation skills. 

 

As software we will be using:

-          CAD modeling: SketchUp, Ecotect and Rhino

-          Analysis: Ecotect, Radiance, Daysim, Evalglare

 

The following topics will be covered. Additional topics can be added at
participants' request:

-          The role of daylighting and simulations in design

-          Rules of thumb that work

-          Balance point and direct shading studies

-          Daylight factor calculation and analysis

-          Model Q&A

-          Climate-based daylighting metrics

-          Modeling occupant behavior

-          Predicting electric lighting energy use

-          Advanced glare analysis

-          Modeling light and health phenomena

-          Presenting results 

-          Modeling advanced materials

 

Please contact Margaret Moore de Chicojay (corlette_mccoy at harvard.edu;
617-496-8728) or myself should you have any questions regarding the
program. You are strongly encouraged to register by June 15.

Frederik,

You are thinking too much. IMO, you don't need to do dynamic simulation. You only need the worst case. If you want to do CFD simulation for a year, it's almost impossible. It takes forever for the calculation to finish. The industry don't even calculate a year load to size the equipement, why do you need to? Unless you want to do energy analysis for the building for the whole year, you are not supposed to do that. 

If you want to do energy modeling for the building for a year and you want to include stratification effect, I know E+ and Trace have DV feature. Actually Trace just released this feature about a month ago since it produced unexpected result. You may try these two products.

As for the stratification, it's not?very sensitive to your input. If you create the model correctly and the computation converges, the stratification is quite stable. 

About the radiation, you need to choose the appropriate model. The calculation time can be much longer if you have many objects in the model. It's easy to take several days for one CFD model to finish?from my experience.

Hi Ding,
?
With regards to importing the boundary conditions from the dynamic (thermal) simulation, how do you take building mass into account. Some of the external conditions i absorbed by the floors and walls. Can you get the CFD calculations to take this factor into account when using CFD? I haven't heard of this before. 
?
Also the CFD results are only a predicted airflow and are extremely sensitive to input parameters, and the flow is more or less steady state. Therefore the CFD can only be used to illustrate what could possibly happen, and to get an idea of the stratefication. However as you mention with regards to stratefication, I need a dynamic simulation which can calculate stratefication relatively simple so that the stratefication would vary over time. E+ sounds like a possibility, but if it only can calculate stratefication when using displacement ventilation, then it becomes less attractive to use. Do you know of any other software which can calculate stratefication? The Danish program BSim has a fixed parameter for stratification so this program can not be used for calculation over a whole year unless the calculation is divided up into smaller parts, and the stratefication is changed manually, based on CFD calculations.
?
I agree with you that it is important to include radiation! However it takes longer to obtain convergance with this module "on". How do you manage to calculate large rooms with many surfaces, and still including radiation? Clustering of (many) computers?
?

Hi Paul,
?
Thanks for your reply. I haven't heard about DesignBuilder CFD before and I have only heard and peaked to EnergyPlus. EnergyPlus seems OK for simulating multizones and thermal simulations. Do you know how it handles stratification? I am thinking of using thermal simulations, with a good link to a multizone program so that the 2 programs can predict the air movement as well as the stratification in the room.. I am then thinking of doing 4 CFD studies and these simulations should have input from the thermal simulation. The output from the CFD simulations should then be compared to the results from the thermal simulation. The two calculations should therefor be reasonably comparable (in the end).
?
DesignBuilder just released v2. I'm not quite familiar with its CFD module, but I believe DB was mainly used with E+. If you want to achieve stratification, you have to use some CFD package. E+ has a DV module which may have stratification feature, but that's only for DV.

I have obtained good results for indoor climate using ke-turbulence model. Is my thought "out of date" on this point? Does ke-turbulence model also work for larger rooms?

What is your experience on coupling thermal/multizone simulations with CFD calculations? Does it work? It could be very useful if the CFD calculation starts with the same boundary conditions and results from the thermal simulation, rather than starting from scratch every time a CFD analysis has to be performed.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Interpretation: Existing Building Envelope
Message-ID: <028a01c9e4a7$5da5fb40$18f1f1c0$@com>

I?ve run into one of those grey areas of the Appendix G language on a
project. We are looking at a major renovation project where the shell of
the building will be upgraded.



Clearly the baseline building will be modeled with insulation U-values
that correspond to the existing conditions of the building rather than the
insulation levels prescribed by tables 5.5-1 to 5.5-8. I think this is
pretty well established.


My question is about the quantity of glazing in each case. For this
project we will be punching new glazing into the existing fa?ade as part
of the renovations.



?         Table G3.1, Section 5 states that ?Vertical fenestration areas
for new buildings and alterations shall equal that in the proposed design
or 40% of gross above-grade wall area, whichever is smaller.? So if we add
new windows, it would seem that the baseline building should also have
those windows, but what should their U-value be? Same U-value as the other
existing windows? Lookup the value for new glazing?



?         Lower in that same section of Table G3.1 it states: ?Existing
Buildings. For existing building envelopes, the baseline building design
shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions that are part of
the scope of work being evaluated.? To me, this seems to say that you
would go with the existing quantity of glazing, and the proposed model
would have more glazing than the baseline, even if the proposed does not
exceed the 40% cap.



There seems to be a little contradiction between the two requirements. My
inclination is that the existing building clause overrides the requirement
that the same amount of glazing be used in each model.



Have any of you worked on a project where this came up? Any thoughts? It
seems like this could potentially be one of those hot topics of
discussion.

Hi Ding,
 
I need to do a dynamic simulation, because the client wants to know how many hours during the year, his demands regarding indoor climate are met. However I won't do CFD calculations for a whole year, because of the computing time. It's simply not possible. This is why I need a dynamic simulation tool which can simulate varying temperature stratefication and different loads. Your advice on using E+ is therefore taken ito concideration as well as TRNSYS.
 
Both programs offer som output which can be imported into the CFD calculations in order to glance at the draft rate in the occupied zone. For the CFD calculations I will use your advice on using "Indoor zero equation" and see how it works, as well as minimizing the amount of objects in the model so that I can use the radiation module.
 
Thanks for your help and advice. Hope it works. :-)

Frederik,
 
You are thinking too much. IMO, you don't need to do dynamic simulation. You only need the worst case. If you want to do CFD simulation for a year, it's almost impossible.. It takes forever for the calculation to finish. The industry don't even calculate a year load to size the equipement, why do you need to? Unless you want to do energy analysis for the building for the whole year, you are not supposed to do that. 
 
If you want to do energy modeling for the building for a year and you want to include stratification effect, I know E+ and Trace have DV feature. Actually Trace just released this feature about a month ago since it produced unexpected result. You may try these two products.
 
As for the stratification, it's not very sensitive to your input. If you create the model correctly and the computation converges, the stratification is quite stable. 
 
About the radiation, you need to choose the appropriate model. The calculation time can be much longer if you have many objects in the model. It's easy to take several days for one CFD model to finish from my experience.

Hi Ding,
 
With regards to importing the boundary conditions from the dynamic (thermal) simulation, how do you take building mass into account. Some of the external conditions i absorbed by the floors and walls. Can you get the CFD calculations to take this factor into account when using CFD? I haven't heard of this before. 
 
Also the CFD results are only a predicted airflow and are extremely sensitive to input parameters, and the flow is more or less steady state. Therefore the CFD can only be used to illustrate what could possibly happen, and to get an idea of the stratefication.. However as you mention with regards to stratefication, I need a dynamic simulation which can calculate stratefication relatively simple so that the stratefication would vary over time. E+ sounds like a possibility, but if it only can calculate stratefication when using displacement ventilation, then it becomes less attractive to use. Do you know of any other software which can calculate stratefication? The Danish program BSim has a fixed parameter for stratification so this program can not be used for calculation over a whole year unless the calculation is divided up into smaller parts, and the stratefication is changed manually, based on CFD calculations.
 
I agree with you that it is important to include radiation! However it takes longer to obtain convergance with this module "on". How do you manage to calculate large rooms with many surfaces, and still including radiation? Clustering of (many) computers?

Hi Paul,
 
Thanks for your reply. I haven't heard about DesignBuilder CFD before and I have only heard and peaked to EnergyPlus. EnergyPlus seems OK for simulating multizones and thermal simulations. Do you know how it handles stratification? I am thinking of using thermal simulations, with a good link to a multizone program so that the 2 programs can predict the air movement as well as the stratification in the room. I am then thinking of doing 4 CFD studies and these simulations should have input from the thermal simulation. The output from the CFD simulations should then be compared to the results from the thermal simulation. The two calculations should therefor be reasonably comparable (in the end).
 
DesignBuilder just released v2. I'm not quite familiar with its CFD module, but I believe DB was mainly used with E+. If you want to achieve stratification, you have to use some CFD package. E+ has a DV module which may have stratification feature, but that's only for DV. 
 
I think that the use LES turbulence model for indoor climate analysis is rather hazardous because this turbulence model is mostly used for fire and smoke simulations. I have obtained good results for indoor climate using ke-turbulence model. Is my thought "out of date" on this point? Does ke-turbulence model also work for larger rooms? When can/should LES-turbulence model be used, apart from smoke/fire simulations? The problem is also getting a thermal simulation program, which can import the results from a CFD calculation. 
 
Using the transient calculations could prove very useful in showing the uncertainty in the CFD calculations. However, can I, when importing the boundary conditions from the thermal simulation to the CFD simulation, import the temperature stratefication as a start condition for the simulation? What is your experience on coupling thermal/multizone simulations with CFD calculations? Does it work? It could be very useful if the CFD calculation starts with the same boundary conditions and results from the thermal simulation, rather than starting from scratch every time a CFD analysis has to be performed.
 
I'm not sure the exact meaning of your "thermal simulation". If you refer to the mechanical load calculation software, eg. Trane trace or other heating/cooling software, the answer is yes. You can calculate the heat flux at the exterior wall/roof/floor and then import them into your CFD model. But you need to verify the CFD result carefully since the setpoint may be different from the result of your CFD modeling. This could cause some inaccurate result.
 
Do you know of any papers dealing with modeling of solar gain in CFD tools?

Hi Frederik,

 

DesignBuilder CFD would allow you to come up with an EnergyPlus multizone air flow linked thermal simulation coupled with a steady state CFD solution.  This has recently been released and is a cost-effective way of linking the 2.  If you used DesignBuilder to develop the energy model/Steady State CFD solution carried out and then use their model export options to give you the model upon which to then import it into a more complex transient CFD tool should it be necessary.  To some extent you could argue whether or not you need the transient analysis as the dynamic simulations should give you the temporal solution for the airflow and then you could look at what happens for say peak or mean flow conditions perhaps.  But I'd suggest that it might well be worth it from what you are describing as even a well set up thermal multizone model would do most of what you describe, but the thermal stratification issues are going to be a sticking point for most simulation tools, both Dynamic or CFD to some extent.

 

If you really wanted to see the time effects of the Solar Gain on airflows, etc, there are many CFD tools available that would be able to do this, obviously all the major CFD engines would do this comfortably (Airpak from Ansys Fluent most easily I suspect with its integrated solar gain modelling tool) but they are going to be quite expensive and there is quite a learning curve to some of them.

 

Alternatively, you could use something like PyroSim, which is a good front end for NIST that would probably be suitable.  NIST does transient analysis and is used commonly for smoke/fire analysis.  It uses LES turbulence models from memory and so would be likely to be more accurate for the sort of stratified flows you'd get in an Atria as well.  You could then set transient boundaries based on files of data exported by the dynamic engine.  Might take a bit of work, but it should work.

 

Regards

Paul

Hi, 

I am currently starting up on simulating a relatively large atrium in Denmark (app. 55?N) with a glazed roof (sloped towards the sun - clever), open balconies with working areas connected to the atrium, as well as a smaller atrium with smaller openings connecting the two atria together with each other. The main focus in the simulation is first of all the air velocity and temperature distribution in the occupied zone and on the balconies - describing the thermal comfort as well as draft rate. The next focus is on integrating the smaller atria as a heat exchanger in winter time as well as analyzing if this can be used for cooling in summer time, transporting the air from outside to the biggest atrium, via the smaller atrium with little heating of the air. The calculations I want to perform in CFD also regards simulations of the solar gain in the biggest atrium. However simulating radiation in CFD simulations require more computing power for bigger rooms with a lot of surfaces. Any advice on simulating solar gain in CFD? How can this dynamic gain be simulated in CFD? Another cool thing in this atrium would be the heat recovery of the extracted air in the top part of the atrium.

Simulating this in a thermal simulation software requires a lot of luck to obtain the correct (and true) result in the first couple of simulations. However I am thinking of integrating the results from a CFD calculation into the thermal simulation. I am thinking of doing this as an iterative process, integrating the results from CFD when needed in the thermal simulations. This will probably result in at least 4 different simulations over a whole year, giving detailed results (temperature gradient, flow between zones, convective heat-transfer coefficients etc.) which can be used in the thermal simulation for these 4 periods over a year. As mentioned above simulating radiation in CFD is tough, I am thinking of leaving this calculation in the thermal simulation.

Another simpler setup would be the integration of a multi-zone calculation in the thermal simulation giving a more coarse result of the main flow route in the atrium and mixing between balconies and the atrium. However these results could potentially give the same detailed results I am looking for.

Finally has any one worked on an uncertainty analysis of these coupling methods illustrating first of all the uncertainty in the results as well as the sensitivity in the input parameters?

Has anyone done something like this before and what tools were used? I have been given free hands with regards to choice of software so any feedback on this subject will be useful. I'm really looking forward to hear from you :-)

Nathan,

 

Your conclusion is the same one I have reached in the past in this situation - the existing building clause is the overriding factor.  For existing buildings I interpret that the intent is comparing the proposed model to what would occur if you did not change anything about the existing building.  It does contradict some of the other provisions of Appendix G, but many of those provisions seem designed to develop that arbitrary baseline of what would be considered "minimally compliant" for comparison when a rating authority uses Appendix G.  It gets even fuzzier when you have an addition and renovation together since then you have an existing building baseline for the renovated part of the building and an Appendix G baseline for the addition.

Also, could anyone provide some thoughts on DesignBuilder as a simulation

Hi Ding,
?
I need to do a dynamic simulation, because the client wants to know how many hours during the year, his demands regarding indoor climate are met. However I won't do CFD calculations for a whole year, because of the computing time. It's simply not possible. This is why I need a dynamic simulation tool which can simulate varying temperature stratefication and different loads. Your advice on using E+ is therefore taken ito concideration as well as TRNSYS.
?
Both programs offer som output which can be imported into the CFD calculations in order to glance at the draft rate in the occupied zone. For the CFD calculations I will use your advice on using "Indoor zero equation" and see how it works, as well as minimizing the amount of objects in the model so that I can use the radiation module.
?
Thanks for your help and advice. Hope it works. :-)

Frederik,

You are thinking too much. IMO, you don't need to do dynamic simulation. You only need the worst case. If you want to do CFD simulation for a year, it's almost impossible.. It takes forever for the calculation to finish. The industry don't even calculate a year load to size the equipement, why do you need to? Unless you want to do energy analysis for the building for the whole year, you are not supposed to do that. 

If you want to do energy modeling for the building for a year and you want to include stratification effect, I know E+ and Trace have DV feature. Actually Trace just released this feature about a month ago since it produced unexpected result. You may try these two products.

As for the stratification, it's not?very sensitive to your input. If you create the model correctly and the computation converges, the stratification is quite stable. 

About the radiation, you need to choose the appropriate model. The calculation time can be much longer if you have many objects in the model. It's easy to take several days for one CFD model to finish?from my experience.

Hi Ding,
?
With regards to importing the boundary conditions from the dynamic (thermal) simulation, how do you take building mass into account. Some of the external conditions i absorbed by the floors and walls.. Can you get the CFD calculations to take this factor into account when using CFD? I haven't heard of this before. 
?
Also the CFD results are only a predicted airflow and are extremely sensitive to input parameters, and the flow is more or less steady state. Therefore the CFD can only be used to illustrate what could possibly happen, and to get an idea of the stratefication.. However as you mention with regards to stratefication, I need a dynamic simulation which can calculate stratefication relatively simple so that the stratefication would vary over time. E+ sounds like a possibility, but if it only can calculate stratefication when using displacement ventilation, then it becomes less attractive to use. Do you know of any other software which can calculate stratefication? The Danish program BSim has a fixed parameter for stratification so this program can not be used for calculation over a whole year unless the calculation is divided up into smaller parts, and the stratefication is changed manually, based on CFD calculations.
?
I agree with you that it is important to include radiation! However it takes longer to obtain convergance with this module "on". How do you manage to calculate large rooms with many surfaces, and still including radiation? Clustering of (many) computers?
?

Hi Paul,
?
Thanks for your reply. I haven't heard about DesignBuilder CFD before and I have only heard and peaked to EnergyPlus. EnergyPlus seems OK for simulating multizones and thermal simulations. Do you know how it handles stratification? I am thinking of using thermal simulations, with a good link to a multizone program so that the 2 programs can predict the air movement as well as the stratification in the room. I am then thinking of doing 4 CFD studies and these simulations should have input from the thermal simulation. The output from the CFD simulations should then be compared to the results from the thermal simulation. The two calculations should therefor be reasonably comparable (in the end).
?
DesignBuilder just released v2. I'm not quite familiar with its CFD module, but I believe DB was mainly used with E+. If you want to achieve stratification, you have to use some CFD package. E+ has a DV module which may have stratification feature, but that's only for DV. 
?
I think that the use LES turbulence model for indoor climate analysis is rather hazardous because this turbulence model is mostly used for fire and smoke simulations. I have obtained good results for indoor climate using ke-turbulence model. Is my thought "out of date" on this point? Does ke-turbulence model also work for larger rooms? When can/should LES-turbulence model be used, apart from smoke/fire simulations??The problem is also getting a thermal simulation program, which can import the results from a CFD calculation. 
?
Using the transient calculations could prove very useful in showing the uncertainty in the CFD calculations. However, can I, when importing the boundary conditions from the thermal simulation to the CFD simulation, import the temperature stratefication as a start condition for the simulation? What is your experience on coupling thermal/multizone simulations with CFD calculations? Does it work? It could be very useful if the CFD calculation starts with the same boundary conditions and results from the thermal simulation, rather than starting from scratch every time a CFD analysis has to be performed.
?
I'm not sure the exact meaning of your "thermal simulation". If you refer to the mechanical load calculation software, eg. Trane trace or other heating/cooling software, the answer is yes. You can calculate the heat flux at the exterior wall/roof/floor and then import them into your CFD model. But you need to verify the CFD result carefully since the setpoint may be different from the result of your CFD modeling. This could cause some inaccurate result.
?
Do you know of any papers dealing with modeling of solar gain in CFD tools?

?

Hi Frederik,
?
DesignBuilder CFD would allow you to come up with an EnergyPlus multizone air flow linked thermal simulation coupled with a steady state CFD solution.? This has recently been released and is a cost-effective way of linking the 2.? If you used DesignBuilder to develop the energy model/Steady State CFD solution carried out and then use their model export options to give you the model upon which to then import it into a more complex transient CFD tool should it be necessary.? To some extent you could argue whether or not you need the transient analysis as the dynamic simulations should give you the temporal solution for the airflow and then you could look at what happens for say peak or mean flow conditions perhaps.? But I?d suggest that it might well be worth it from what you are describing as even a well set up thermal multizone model would do most of what you describe, but the thermal stratification issues are going to be a sticking point for most
 simulation tools, both Dynamic or CFD to some extent.
?
If you really wanted to see the time effects of the Solar Gain on airflows, etc, there are many CFD tools available that would be able to do this, obviously all the major CFD engines would do this comfortably (Airpak from Ansys Fluent most easily I suspect with its integrated solar gain modelling tool) but they are going to be quite expensive and there is quite a learning curve to some of them.
?
Alternatively, you could use something like PyroSim, which is a good front end for NIST that would probably be suitable.? NIST does transient analysis and is used commonly for smoke/fire analysis.? It uses LES turbulence models from memory and so would be likely to be more accurate for the sort of stratified flows you?d get in an Atria as well.? You could then set transient boundaries based on files of data exported by the dynamic engine.? Might take a bit of work, but it should work.

Hi,
I am currently starting up on simulating a relatively large atrium in Denmark (app. 55?N) with a glazed roof (sloped towards the sun - clever), open balconies with working areas connected to the atrium, as well as a smaller atrium with smaller openings connecting the two atria together with each other.The main focus in the simulation is first of all the air velocity and temperature distribution in the occupied zone and on the balconies - describing the thermal comfort as well as draft rate. The next focus is on integrating the smaller atria as a heat exchanger in winter time as well as analyzing if this can be used for cooling in summer time, transporting the air from outside to the biggest atrium, via the smaller atrium with little heating of the air. The calculations I want to perform in CFD also regards simulations of the solar gain in the biggest atrium. However simulating radiation in CFD simulations require more computing power for bigger rooms
 with a lot of surfaces. Any advice on simulating solar gain in CFD? How can this dynamic gain be simulated in CFD? Another cool thing in this atrium would be the heat recovery of the extracted air in the top part of the atrium.
Simulating this in a thermal simulation software requires a lot of luck to obtain the correct (and true) result in the first couple of simulations. However I am thinking of integrating the results from a CFD calculation into the thermal simulation. I am thinking of doing this as an iterative process, integrating the results from CFD when needed in the thermal simulations. This will probably result in at least 4 different simulations over a whole year, giving detailed results (temperature gradient, flow between zones, convective heat-transfer coefficients etc.) which can be used in the thermal simulation for these 4 periods over a year. As mentioned above simulating radiation in CFD is tough, I am thinking of leaving this calculation in the thermal simulation.
Another simpler setup would be the integration of a multi-zone calculation in the thermal simulation giving a more coarse result of the main flow route in the atrium and mixing between balconies and the atrium. However these results could potentially give the same detailed results I am looking for.
Finally has any one worked on an uncertainty analysis of these coupling methods illustrating first of all the uncertainty in the results as well as the sensitivity in the input parameters?
Has anyone done something like this before and what tools were used? I have been given free hands with regards to choice of software so any feedback on this subject will be useful. I'm really looking forward to hear from you :-)
Kind regards

Dear All,

 

I am proposing the following methodology:

 

?         Prepare a model based on the current envelope and systems and then
to compare them with utility bills for past 12 / 24 months and establish AS
IS case 

 

?         The AS IS case values can be compared with Appendix G values to
establish their status (either %better or %worse than ASHARE base case) and
prepare an baseline.

 

?         The proposed Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) can be applied to
the AS IS case to calculate % savings

Nathan,

 

Your conclusion is the same one I have reached in the past in this situation
? the existing building clause is the overriding factor.  For existing
buildings I interpret that the intent is comparing the proposed model to
what would occur if you did not change anything about the existing building.
It does contradict some of the other provisions of Appendix G, but many of
those provisions seem designed to develop that arbitrary baseline of what
would be considered ?minimally compliant? for comparison when a rating
authority uses Appendix G.  It gets even fuzzier when you have an addition
and renovation together since then you have an existing building baseline
for the renovated part of the building and an Appendix G baseline for the
addition.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Interpretation: Existing Building Envelope

 

I?ve run into one of those grey areas of the Appendix G language on a
project. We are looking at a major renovation project where the shell of the
building will be upgraded. 

 

Clearly the baseline building will be modeled with insulation U-values that
correspond to the existing conditions of the building rather than the
insulation levels prescribed by tables 5.5-1 to 5.5-8. I think this is
pretty well established.


My question is about the quantity of glazing in each case. For this project
we will be punching new glazing into the existing fa?ade as part of the
renovations. 

 

?         Table G3.1, Section 5 states that ?Vertical fenestration areas for
new buildings and alterations shall equal that in the proposed design or 40%
of gross above-grade wall area, whichever is smaller.? So if we add new
windows, it would seem that the baseline building should also have those
windows, but what should their U-value be? Same U-value as the other
existing windows? Lookup the value for new glazing?

?         Lower in that same section of Table G3.1 it states: ?Existing
Buildings. For existing building envelopes, the baseline building design
shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions that are part of
the scope of work being evaluated.? To me, this seems to say that you would
go with the existing quantity of glazing, and the proposed model would have
more glazing than the baseline, even if the proposed does not exceed the 40%
cap.

 

There seems to be a little contradiction between the two requirements. My
inclination is that the existing building clause overrides the requirement
that the same amount of glazing be used in each model. 

 

Have any of you worked on a project where this came up? Any thoughts? It
seems like this could potentially be one of those hot topics of discussion. 

 

Thanks,

Message-ID: <3EC944427F87D84793DBBC4137A2B5ADEFCFA2@to1exc02wp.halsall.com>

Thanks to Linda and Bill for helping me out with this issue.  As far as App G is concerned, there is a specific set of condenser and chiller temperatures and condenser flows that must be used in the reference building that represent ARI standard conditions for which the COP is 6.1 (for centrifugal chillers > 300 tons).  Therefore the reference building always operates at standard conditions, while the proposed building's performance varies depending on specific operating conditions.
 
While this is tantamount to asking someone to model the proposed building with a Chicago weather file, compare it to a reference building with a Miami weather file and require you to reduce cooling use, the rules are at present clear.  Unreasonable, but clear.
 
So, my question to the design/simulation community is this:  
Has anyone been able to spec a large centrifugal chiller (900-1500 tons) with a full load COP matching or at least approaching 6.1, for a Zone 1 climate?  (Specifically my design conditions are 122F db, 86F wb, 42/57F CHW, 95/105 CW)  If so, if you could please post the spec sheet that would be fantastic.  Unfortunately the manufacturers don't post this kind of performance data so a call to the local rep is needed to produce project specific data.

Subject: Modelling chillers at non-standard operating conditions as per Appendix G


Hello All,
 
I have a question regarding the minimum centrifugal chiller efficiencies for conditions not covered by ASHRAE 90.1-2004 section 6.4.1.2.  Specifically, I'm trying to model a chiller for a building in a hot humid climate.  The specified operating conditions for the condenser EWT are 95?F (35?C), which is beyond the range of conditions covered by ASHRAE.
 
In this case, what should I use for the minimum chiller efficiency in my reference building?  Do I still have to follow Appendix G section G3.1.3.11 which states that my condenser supply temp shall be the lower of 84?F (29?C) or 10?F (5.6?C) approach to design wet-bulb.  The wet-bulb in this climate is 86?F (30?C), so the 10?F approach is therefore 96?F, which means my condenser supply temp (EWT) shall be 84?F (29?C), the lower of the two.  At this condenser EWT, the minimum ASHRAE efficiencies from Table 6.8.1J vary depending on condenser flow.  Since condenser flow is not specified by Appendix G, should I simply used the Kadj equations at the bottom of that table?  If that's the case, the condenser DT is 15?F (8?C) and the Lift is 41?F (22.7?C) and I arrive at an adjustment factor Kadj of 0.88.  Applied to my standard COP of 6.1, I get a COP of 5.4.  
 
My issue with this approach is that this COP is very difficult to achieve at our operating conditions.  In my opinion, this is an unfair comparison for chillers in very hot humid climates since Appendix G is prescribing operating conditions which are considerably more "temperate" than the extreme conditions under which our chillers will operate.  We can realistically achieve a COP of 5.1.  In this climate, cooling is a dominant load, yet due to Appendix G "rules", it will be very difficult to meet the LEED energy prerequisite, since our chiller are worse than reference.
 
Finally, I'm assuming that since ASHRAE does not cover this operating range, I don't have to worry about meeting the mandatory provisions for efficiency listed in Tables 6.8.1H, I and J in my proposed building, ie there is no minimum chiller efficiency for this range.
 
Any help in this matter would be much appreciated.  If I've missed something in my calculations or wasn't clear enough, please let me know because this issue is a big concern to our project.
 
Many thanks,

I think you are confusing the ARI standard rating conditions which are climate independent and your project specific design conditions.

Additionally there are requirements in Appendix G for reset, so the reference building chiller will not always operate at standard conditions.

Subject: Modelling chillers at non-standard operating conditions as per Appendix G
Hello All,

I have a question regarding the minimum centrifugal chiller efficiencies for conditions not covered by ASHRAE 90.1-2004 section 6.4.1.2.  Specifically, I'm trying to model a chiller for a building in a hot humid climate.  The specified operating conditions for the condenser EWT are 95?F (35?C), which is beyond the range of conditions covered by ASHRAE.

In this case, what should I use for the minimum chiller efficiency in my reference building?  Do I still have to follow Appendix G section G3.1.3.11 which states that my condenser supply temp shall be the lower of 84?F (29?C) or 10?F (5.6?C) approach to design wet-bulb.  The wet-bulb in this climate is 86?F (30?C), so the 10?F approach is therefore 96?F, which means my condenser supply temp (EWT) shall be 84?F (29?C), the lower of the two.  At this condenser EWT, the minimum ASHRAE efficiencies from Table 6.8.1J vary depending on condenser flow.  Since condenser flow is not specified by Appendix G, should I simply used the Kadj equations at the bottom of that table?  If that's the case, the condenser DT is 15?F (8?C) and the Lift is 41?F (22.7?C) and I arrive at an adjustment factor Kadj of 0.88.  Applied to my standard COP of 6.1, I get a COP of 5.4.

My issue with this approach is that this COP is very difficult to achieve at our operating conditions.  In my opinion, this is an unfair comparison for chillers in very hot humid climates since Appendix G is prescribing operating conditions which are considerably more "temperate" than the extreme conditions under which our chillers will operate.  We can realistically achieve a COP of 5.1.  In this climate, cooling is a dominant load, yet due to Appendix G "rules", it will be very difficult to meet the LEED energy prerequisite, since our chiller are worse than reference.

Finally, I'm assuming that since ASHRAE does not cover this operating range, I don't have to worry about meeting the mandatory provisions for efficiency listed in Tables 6.8.1H, I and J in my proposed building, ie there is no minimum chiller efficiency for this range.

Any help in this matter would be much appreciated.  If I've missed something in my calculations or wasn't clear enough, please let me know because this issue is a big concern to our project.

Paul,
 
Please correct me if I'm wrong since I'm fairly confused by this, but App G specifies a project-independent set of conditions for chilled water systems.  Maybe these are not ARI standard as I incorrectly pointed out, but the point is that App G tells me which conditions I must use.  Therefore, if my project-specific conditions are more extreme, the chiller/cooling tower has to work harder, and the efficiency decreases.  This is therefore an unfair comparison between some arbitrary set of conditions for the reference building, and the project-specific ones for the proposed building, similar to using two different weather files.  
 
If anyone disagrees with this, please let me know because I'm quite concerned about this issue which seems like a significant oversight, especially for hot, humid climates.
 
Thanks,
Luka

I think you are confusing the ARI standard rating conditions which are climate independent and your project specific design conditions.

 

Additionally there are requirements in Appendix G for reset, so the reference building chiller will not always operate at standard conditions.

Thanks to Linda and Bill for helping me out with this issue.  As far as App G is concerned, there is a specific set of condenser and chiller temperatures and condenser flows that must be used in the reference building that represent ARI standard conditions for which the COP is 6.1 (for centrifugal chillers > 300 tons).  Therefore the reference building always operates at standard conditions, while the proposed building's performance varies depending on specific operating conditions.

 

While this is tantamount to asking someone to model the proposed building with a Chicago weather file, compare it to a reference building with a Miami weather file and require you to reduce cooling use, the rules are at present clear.  Unreasonable, but clear.

 

So, my question to the design/simulation community is this:  

Has anyone been able to spec a large centrifugal chiller (900-1500 tons) with a full load COP matching or at least approaching 6.1, for a Zone 1 climate?  (Specifically my design conditions are 122F db, 86F wb, 42/57F CHW, 95/105 CW)  If so, if you could please post the spec sheet that would be fantastic.  Unfortunately the manufacturers don't post this kind of performance data so a call to the local rep is needed to produce project specific data.

I think your (pretty strong) argument is that your Appendix G cooling tower will have difficulty producing 85F ECWT if the wetbulb is 86F.  Your design is 9F difference, there must be some acceptable value between -1F and 10F for the baseline building approach.

I speculate that the wording of G3.1.3.11 was to make the baseline use a colder ECWT below 85F as standard where available, not to penalize hot-humid projects.

You may want to submit a CIR to establish a reasonable ECWT schedule, and/or review the 90.1 addenda so that you can move forward.

Given that we can establish that both proposed and baseline chillers operate outside of non-standard conditions in Table 6.8.1J regarding the efficiency of the chiller, in most cases where something is excluded from the standard the approach is to use the same value in both models - so not penalizing you, but not a place for efficiency gains either.  This may be the approach rather than your extrapolated efficiency - it is either covered by the standard, or not covered, so the same performance curves could be used in both models.

Unfortunate that this would be such a potentially large energy end-use.  Still there might be opportunities since that would only apply to the mandatory efficiency of the chiller at the non-standard conditions.  The number of chillers, heat exchanger pressure drop/pumping power, water temperatures and temperature reset schedules could all vary - focus in these areas for efficiency opportunities in your proposed design.

I hope this helps, and please others chime in if you agree or disagree with this approach.

Thanks to Linda and Bill for helping me out with this issue.  As far as App G is concerned, there is a specific set of condenser and chiller temperatures and condenser flows that must be used in the reference building that represent ARI standard conditions for which the COP is 6.1 (for centrifugal chillers > 300 tons).

So, my question to the design/simulation community is this:
Has anyone been able to spec a large centrifugal chiller (900-1500 tons) with a full load COP matching or at least approaching 6.1, for a Zone 1 climate?  (Specifically my design conditions are 122F db, 86F wb, 42/57F CHW, 95/105 CW)  If so, if you could please post the spec sheet that would be fantastic.  Unfortunately the manufacturers don't post this kind of performance data so a call to the local rep is needed to produce project specific data.

Subject: Modelling chillers at non-standard operating conditions as per Appendix G
Hello All,

I have a question regarding the minimum centrifugal chiller efficiencies for conditions not covered by ASHRAE 90.1-2004 section 6.4.1.2.  Specifically, I'm trying to model a chiller for a building in a hot humid climate.  The specified operating conditions for the condenser EWT are 95?F (35?C), which is beyond the range of conditions covered by ASHRAE.

In this case, what should I use for the minimum chiller efficiency in my reference building?  Do I still have to follow Appendix G section G3.1.3.11 which states that my condenser supply temp shall be the lower of 84?F (29?C) or 10?F (5.6?C) approach to design wet-bulb.  The wet-bulb in this climate is 86?F (30?C), so the 10?F approach is therefore 96?F, which means my condenser supply temp (EWT) shall be 84?F (29?C), the lower of the two.  At this condenser EWT, the minimum ASHRAE efficiencies from Table 6.8.1J vary depending on condenser flow.  Since condenser flow is not specified by Appendix G, should I simply used the Kadj equations at the bottom of that table?  If that's the case, the condenser DT is 15?F (8?C) and the Lift is 41?F (22.7?C) and I arrive at an adjustment factor Kadj of 0.88.  Applied to my standard COP of 6.1, I get a COP of 5.4.

My issue with this approach is that this COP is very difficult to achieve at our operating conditions.  In my opinion, this is an unfair comparison for chillers in very hot humid climates since Appendix G is prescribing operating conditions which are considerably more "temperate" than the extreme conditions under which our chillers will operate.  We can realistically achieve a COP of 5.1.  In this climate, cooling is a dominant load, yet due to Appendix G "rules", it will be very difficult to meet the LEED energy prerequisite, since our chiller are worse than reference.

Finally, I'm assuming that since ASHRAE does not cover this operating range, I don't have to worry about meeting the mandatory provisions for efficiency listed in Tables 6.8.1H, I and J in my proposed building, ie there is no minimum chiller efficiency for this range.

Any help in this matter would be much appreciated.  If I've missed something in my calculations or wasn't clear enough, please let me know because this issue is a big concern to our project.

David,
 
Thanks for your suggestions.  We are planning to submit a CIR and also raise this issue with the 90.1 committee as Bill suggested.  I thought about using the same COP / same conditions in both models to demonstrate a more realistic comparison.  One approach would be to adjust my own chiller COP to match the operating conditions of App G.  However, there may be potential hiccups in eQuest if the software is smart enough to realize it cannot generate the ECWT specified by App G using the actual weather data.  So the other approach is to use the actual operating conditions in both models, but to adjust the reference building COP.
 
Luka

I think your (pretty strong) argument is that your Appendix G cooling tower will have difficulty producing 85F ECWT if the wetbulb is 86F.  Your design is 9F difference, there must be some acceptable value between -1F and 10F for the baseline building approach.

 

I speculate that the wording of G3.1.3.11 was to make the baseline use a colder ECWT below 85F as standard where available, not to penalize hot-humid projects.

 

You may want to submit a CIR to establish a reasonable ECWT schedule, and/or review the 90.1 addenda so that you can move forward.

 

Given that we can establish that both proposed and baseline chillers operate outside of non-standard conditions in Table 6.8.1J regarding the efficiency of the chiller, in most cases where something is excluded from the standard the approach is to use the same value in both models - so not penalizing you, but not a place for efficiency gains either.  This may be the approach rather than your extrapolated efficiency - it is either covered by the standard, or not covered, so the same performance curves could be used in both models.

 

Unfortunate that this would be such a potentially large energy end-use.  Still there might be opportunities since that would only apply to the mandatory efficiency of the chiller at the non-standard conditions.  The number of chillers, heat exchanger pressure drop/pumping power, water temperatures and temperature reset schedules could all vary - focus in these areas for efficiency opportunities in your proposed design.

 

I hope this helps, and please others chime in if you agree or disagree with this approach.

 

David

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Modelling chillers at non-standard operating conditions as per Appendix G

 

Thanks to Linda and Bill for helping me out with this issue.  As far as App G is concerned, there is a specific set of condenser and chiller temperatures and condenser flows that must be used in the reference building that represent ARI standard conditions for which the COP is 6.1 (for centrifugal chillers > 300 tons).  Therefore the reference building always operates at standard conditions, while the proposed building's performance varies depending on specific operating conditions.

 

While this is tantamount to asking someone to model the proposed building with a Chicago weather file, compare it to a reference building with a Miami weather file and require you to reduce cooling use, the rules are at present clear.  Unreasonable, but clear.

 

So, my question to the design/simulation community is this:  

Has anyone been able to spec a large centrifugal chiller (900-1500 tons) with a full load COP matching or at least approaching 6.1, for a Zone 1 climate?  (Specifically my design conditions are 122F db, 86F wb, 42/57F CHW, 95/105 CW)  If so, if you could please post the spec sheet that would be fantastic.  Unfortunately the manufacturers don't post this kind of performance data so a call to the local rep is needed to produce project specific data.

Subject: Modelling chillers at non-standard operating conditions as per Appendix G

Hello All,

 

I have a question regarding the minimum centrifugal chiller efficiencies for conditions not covered by ASHRAE 90.1-2004 section 6.4.1.2.  Specifically, I'm trying to model a chiller for a building in a hot humid climate.  The specified operating conditions for the condenser EWT are 95?F (35?C), which is beyond the range of conditions covered by ASHRAE.

 

In this case, what should I use for the minimum chiller efficiency in my reference building?  Do I still have to follow Appendix G section G3.1.3.11 which states that my condenser supply temp shall be the lower of 84?F (29?C) or 10?F (5.6?C) approach to design wet-bulb.  The wet-bulb in this climate is 86?F (30?C), so the 10?F approach is therefore 96?F, which means my condenser supply temp (EWT) shall be 84?F (29?C), the lower of the two.  At this condenser EWT, the minimum ASHRAE efficiencies from Table 6.8.1J vary depending on condenser flow.  Since condenser flow is not specified by Appendix G, should I simply used the Kadj equations at the bottom of that table?  If that's the case, the condenser DT is 15?F (8?C) and the Lift is 41?F (22.7?C) and I arrive at an adjustment factor Kadj of 0.88.  Applied to my standard COP of 6.1, I get a COP of 5.4.  

 

My issue with this approach is that this COP is very difficult to achieve at our operating conditions.  In my opinion, this is an unfair comparison for chillers in very hot humid climates since Appendix G is prescribing operating conditions which are considerably more "temperate" than the extreme conditions under which our chillers will operate.  We can realistically achieve a COP of 5.1.  In this climate, cooling is a dominant load, yet due to Appendix G "rules", it will be very difficult to meet the LEED energy prerequisite, since our chiller are worse than reference.

 

Finally, I'm assuming that since ASHRAE does not cover this operating range, I don't have to worry about meeting the mandatory provisions for efficiency listed in Tables 6.8.1H, I and J in my proposed building, ie there is no minimum chiller efficiency for this range.

 

Any help in this matter would be much appreciated.  If I've missed something in my calculations or wasn't clear enough, please let me know because this issue is a big concern to our project.

All;
I'm not sure this is a huge deal. Somehow folks manage to use the PRM
and simulate air-cooled DX equipment (rated/baseline condensing drybulb
T 95F) in Las Vegas and Phoenix (design drybulb condensing T 110F). 
 
The program will decrease the baseline/rated chiller or compressor
efficiency and capacity at the higher hourly condensing temps, be those
water or air, during the simulated year compared to the  baseline/rated
temperatures. I don't think any rating authority would argue with
increasing the rated chiller capacity in the baseline to offset the loss
of capacity at actual/simulated conditions. (And there is a 15% safety
factor built in somewhere, for baselines modeled to the PRM.) One might
want to chart the COP and capacity vs. ECWT curves for centrifugal
chillers to make sure they extrapolate reasonably to the high ECWT
temps. This would be an issue even if the baseline conditions were
adjusted, and whatever program is used.

Anyone's first LEED project requires an investment of time to learn how to
do it.  This learning curve is somewhat steep but once you learn how to do,
actually doing it takes considerably less time.  Outside soft costs
(commissioning, energy modeling and LEED documentation) if you are spending
a dime more for construction costs than conventional for LEED Certified or
Silver then you have made an optional choice or are not properly applying
the system.  Many projects attain the Gold certification level without an
increase in construction costs.  

 

There have been several cost studies over the years than do not show that
LEED requires the type of investment purported by the American Chemistry
Council.  Here are some links:

 

http://www.cap-e.com/publications/default.cfm

http://www.davislangdon.com/USA/Research/ResearchFinder/2007-The-Cost-of-Gre
en-Revisited/

 

The Davis Langdon study above is far more thorough and comprehensive than
the much older ACC report which relies on a considerable amount of early
anecdotal evidence.

 

In many respects the cost of LEED comes down to what you assign to LEED as
an "extra" cost.  Many teams have figured out how to neutralize even the
added soft costs through an integrative design process.

The LEED experience of the team is a factor.  The LEED AP has to do a
lot more education and "hand holding" on a rookie team.

I agree with Marcus on this on.  Langdon's study is a follow-up to his
earlier work and confirms the statement that LEED projects are
distributed across the cost spectrum rather randomly.  
 
It all depends what you are comparing against.  If you are trying to
design a high-performance building, there should be no construction cost
premium to go to LEED, provided you have an "experienced" design team
and construction manager / trades.  There may be some soft premiums for
additional documentation requirements, but LEED requirements are not
that onerous for design teams.  Mechanical consultants in particular
should be designing according to ASHRAE anyway for building code
compliance and modelling is an extension of the mechanical/architectural
integrated design process of optimizing buildings for low-energy use
starting with passive design and then high-efficiency systems.  If on
the other hand you want to build a code building, then yes there will be
a premium.  
 
Let's be serious, LEED is not rocket science, it should be code, not
some mark of distinction.  The fact that LEED is seen as difficult to
achieve just shows how far behind the eight ball we are in trying to
address the environmental impact of buildings.  
 
European buildings regularly achieve less than 100 ekWh/m2.  Yet in
North America, we're not only consuming 3 times that amount, but we have
managed to lower our energy usage by a mere 7% since the 1920s!!! (See
Graph 3 showing the CBECS data in this article:
http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/insights/bsi-012-why-energy-mat
ters/)  We have a long long way to go to Architecture 2030....roughly a
millennium if we keep this pace up!

Paul,
 
Without further context, the answer to your question would be: as much
time and money as any other building.  I think the whole point of
Langdon's study is that LEED is NOT a differentiator of building costs.
LEED buildings cost as little as $200/sf and as much as $600/sf.  
 
If you want, you can determine the cost of "certification" alone from
the USGBC website based on sf, and add the time required for USGBC's
LEED documentation review to the project schedule.

Paul without seeing the articles to which you refer I really can't comment
about the comparison of the studies.  

 

Regarding cost and LEED I can offer my own personal experience on more than
100 commercial projects pursuing LEED certification - none has even come
close to approaching the bottom end of the cost range in the ACC study.  I
have no doubt that some projects are spending 4.5% to 11% more but frankly
they are using LEED the wrong way (as a checklist of independent variables
in a point hunting exercise) and the market will weed those practitioners
out over time.  All things being equal LEED does add cost but it is only the
measuring tool.  The real question is does a high performance green building
cost more?  If done correctly my experience is that it does not.

 

We are currently working on a school project which is borderline Platinum.
It was bid last summer and came in significantly under budget and attracted
a $500,000 state grant.  So the actual cost is less than conventional
overall even without the grant.  Project cost drivers are primarily a
function of building type and location.  Within those broad categories it is
about design choices, one can choose to focus resources on building
performance or on other priorities.  Project teams who choose to focus on
the priorities spelled out in LEED can easily do so within the confines of a
conventional project budget.  The rest is just a bit of paperwork.

 

The first time that an architectural firm had to use CAD drawings instead of
hand-drawn; the first time they had to comply with ADA; when major building
code changes occur - all of these things resulted in added costs.  As
experience is gained costs come down significantly and the same thing is
happening with LEED (the ACC study indicates that this was likely to
happen).

 

The real answer to your question is - "it depends" - on many factors
including team experience, priorities, project size, strategies, design
process, etc.  You really can't assume it costs more but if you do, it
probably will.

On your last point I agree whole-heartedly!

 

Without entering that data quagmire, I suggest that we all need to do a
better job of understanding building energy use, gathering more data,
connecting modeled and actual performance, developing better tools,
producing more informed modelers, creating performance feedback loops for
designers, developing better metrics, etc. to make sure LEED and other
systems produce the right signals and improve performance.

 

If anyone has any thoughts on how to improve LEED to ensure better
performance feel free to pitch in and help us make it better.

Marcus and all,

 

While the cost of LEED Certification is important, equally important are how
well are LEED projects performing. The New Buildings Institute study (March
2008) of 121 LEED NC v2 buildings certified through 2006 claimed "on average
LEED energy use 25-30% better than the National Average." However a number
of critics of this study has emerged, many of whom used the same data that
NBI used. Henry Gifford has question the methodology used in the NBI study.
The American Physical Society in their Energy Future: Think Efficiency
Report as well as Joe Lstiburek has also questioned the NBI study. Now Dr.
John Scofield from Oberlin has completed a detailed re-examination of the
NBI study and has found that "the NBI data shows that LEED certification has
done nothing to lower building primary energy consumption and associated GHG
emission." I have attached his paper which will be presented at the
International Energy Program Evaluation Conference scheduled for Portland,
OR. August 11-14, 2009. 

 

I believe that the Bldg-Sim community needs to address this issue. Otherwise
the services that we perform will become seriously questioned by the
building profession. Even if LEED buildings cost more, which I believe most
building professionals and clients would accept. It is unacceptable if they
can't deliver on energy performance. 

 

Regards

Paul without seeing the articles to which you refer I really can't comment
about the comparison of the studies.  

 

Regarding cost and LEED I can offer my own personal experience on more than
100 commercial projects pursuing LEED certification - none has even come
close to approaching the bottom end of the cost range in the ACC study.  I
have no doubt that some projects are spending 4.5% to 11% more but frankly
they are using LEED the wrong way (as a checklist of independent variables
in a point hunting exercise) and the market will weed those practitioners
out over time.  All things being equal LEED does add cost but it is only the
measuring tool.  The real question is does a high performance green building
cost more?  If done correctly my experience is that it does not.

 

We are currently working on a school project which is borderline Platinum.
It was bid last summer and came in significantly under budget and attracted
a $500,000 state grant.  So the actual cost is less than conventional
overall even without the grant.  Project cost drivers are primarily a
function of building type and location.  Within those broad categories it is
about design choices, one can choose to focus resources on building
performance or on other priorities.  Project teams who choose to focus on
the priorities spelled out in LEED can easily do so within the confines of a
conventional project budget.  The rest is just a bit of paperwork.

 

The first time that an architectural firm had to use CAD drawings instead of
hand-drawn; the first time they had to comply with ADA; when major building
code changes occur - all of these things resulted in added costs.  As
experience is gained costs come down significantly and the same thing is
happening with LEED (the ACC study indicates that this was likely to
happen).

 

The real answer to your question is - "it depends" - on many factors
including team experience, priorities, project size, strategies, design
process, etc.  You really can't assume it costs more but if you do, it
probably will.

Thanks for the links Marcus.  

 

I have scanned the Langdon document and even looked at later articles
written on the topic.  They agree that the Langdon study is more
comprehensive but still gravitate towards the costing provided by the
American Chemistry Council. My take on the matter is that the real issue
here is not whether LEED certification costs more, but how much does it
cost: both in terms of time and expense.

Anyone's first LEED project requires an investment of time to learn how to
do it.  This learning curve is somewhat steep but once you learn how to do,
actually doing it takes considerably less time.  Outside soft costs
(commissioning, energy modeling and LEED documentation) if you are spending
a dime more for construction costs than conventional for LEED Certified or
Silver then you have made an optional choice or are not properly applying
the system.  Many projects attain the Gold certification level without an
increase in construction costs.  

 

There have been several cost studies over the years than do not show that
LEED requires the type of investment purported by the American Chemistry
Council.  Here are some links:

 

http://www.cap-e.com/publications/default.cfm

http://www.davislangdon.com/USA/Research/ResearchFinder/2007-The-Cost-of-Gre
en-Revisited/

 

The Davis Langdon study above is far more thorough and comprehensive than
the much older ACC report which relies on a considerable amount of early
anecdotal evidence.

 

In many respects the cost of LEED comes down to what you assign to LEED as
an "extra" cost.  Many teams have figured out how to neutralize even the
added soft costs through an integrative design process.

Northbridge Environmental Management Consultants

LEED Certification, which is available online at the following link:

It indicates that the documentation takes 226 working hours on average to
prepare and costs between US$8,000 - US$70,000 per project: the first
project costing between US$30,000 - US$60,000.

It indicates that the documentation takes 226 working hours on average to prepare and costs between US$8,000 - US$70,000 per project: the first project costing between US$30,000 - US$60,000.

I think we're entering a whole new area of discussion rife with
controversy, but I can't help but throw in my two cents.
 
In terms of Marcus's last point, I think one of the quickest and easiest
ways to improve LEED in terms of delivering energy performance is to
split the M&V credit along commissioning lines and have a minimum level
of M&V mandatory as a prerequisite.  This way LEED would finally mandate
a move away from predicted energy use and begin to close the energy
loop.  Another idea is to make LEED EB certification a requirement for
LEED-NC buildings after say 5 years.  At a minimum, make
re-commissioning every 5 years an on-going credit.  As Straube pointed
out in the article I linked, operational energy is what's driving this
environmental train-wreck, but it's not what LEED or the design
community at large is focusing on unfortunately.  Nor is there any focus
to educate building owners and operators on how to properly run all
these "high-performance" buildings full of all this wonderful
technology.
 
Once M&V becomes a requirement, our community will need to educate
ourselves on how buildings actually work and begin the difficult task of
creating calibrated simulations that include all energy uses and account
for weather, occupancy and operation.

On your last point I agree whole-heartedly!

 

Without entering that data quagmire, I suggest that we all need to do a
better job of understanding building energy use, gathering more data,
connecting modeled and actual performance, developing better tools,
producing more informed modelers, creating performance feedback loops
for designers, developing better metrics, etc. to make sure LEED and
other systems produce the right signals and improve performance.

 

If anyone has any thoughts on how to improve LEED to ensure better
performance feel free to pitch in and help us make it better.

Marcus and all,

 

While the cost of LEED Certification is important, equally important are
how well are LEED projects performing. The New Buildings Institute study
(March 2008) of 121 LEED NC v2 buildings certified through 2006 claimed
"on average LEED energy use 25-30% better than the National Average."
However a number of critics of this study has emerged, many of whom used
the same data that NBI used. Henry Gifford has question the methodology
used in the NBI study. The American Physical Society in their Energy
Future: Think Efficiency Report as well as Joe Lstiburek has also
questioned the NBI study. Now Dr. John Scofield from Oberlin has
completed a detailed re-examination of the NBI study and has found that
"the NBI data shows that LEED certification has done nothing to lower
building primary energy consumption and associated GHG emission." I have
attached his paper which will be presented at the International Energy
Program Evaluation Conference scheduled for Portland, OR. August 11-14,
2009. 

 

I believe that the Bldg-Sim community needs to address this issue.
Otherwise the services that we perform will become seriously questioned
by the building profession. Even if LEED buildings cost more, which I
believe most building professionals and clients would accept. It is
unacceptable if they can't deliver on energy performance. 

 

Regards

Paul without seeing the articles to which you refer I really can't
comment about the comparison of the studies.  

 

Regarding cost and LEED I can offer my own personal experience on more
than 100 commercial projects pursuing LEED certification - none has even
come close to approaching the bottom end of the cost range in the ACC
study.  I have no doubt that some projects are spending 4.5% to 11% more
but frankly they are using LEED the wrong way (as a checklist of
independent variables in a point hunting exercise) and the market will
weed those practitioners out over time.  All things being equal LEED
does add cost but it is only the measuring tool.  The real question is
does a high performance green building cost more?  If done correctly my
experience is that it does not.

 

We are currently working on a school project which is borderline
Platinum.  It was bid last summer and came in significantly under budget
and attracted a $500,000 state grant.  So the actual cost is less than
conventional overall even without the grant.  Project cost drivers are
primarily a function of building type and location.  Within those broad
categories it is about design choices, one can choose to focus resources
on building performance or on other priorities.  Project teams who
choose to focus on the priorities spelled out in LEED can easily do so
within the confines of a conventional project budget.  The rest is just
a bit of paperwork.

 

The first time that an architectural firm had to use CAD drawings
instead of hand-drawn; the first time they had to comply with ADA; when
major building code changes occur - all of these things resulted in
added costs.  As experience is gained costs come down significantly and
the same thing is happening with LEED (the ACC study indicates that this
was likely to happen).

 

The real answer to your question is - "it depends" - on many factors
including team experience, priorities, project size, strategies, design
process, etc.  You really can't assume it costs more but if you do, it
probably will.

Thanks for the links Marcus.  

 

I have scanned the Langdon document and even looked at later articles
written on the topic.  They agree that the Langdon study is more
comprehensive but still gravitate towards the costing provided by the
American Chemistry Council. My take on the matter is that the real issue
here is not whether LEED certification costs more, but how much does it
cost: both in terms of time and expense.

Anyone's first LEED project requires an investment of time to learn how
to do it.  This learning curve is somewhat steep but once you learn how
to do, actually doing it takes considerably less time.  Outside soft
costs (commissioning, energy modeling and LEED documentation) if you are
spending a dime more for construction costs than conventional for LEED
Certified or Silver then you have made an optional choice or are not
properly applying the system.  Many projects attain the Gold
certification level without an increase in construction costs.  

 

There have been several cost studies over the years than do not show
that LEED requires the type of investment purported by the American
Chemistry Council.  Here are some links:

 

http://www.cap-e.com/publications/default.cfm

http://www.davislangdon.com/USA/Research/ResearchFinder/2007-The-Cost-of
-Green-Revisited/

 

The Davis Langdon study above is far more thorough and comprehensive
than the much older ACC report which relies on a considerable amount of
early anecdotal evidence.

 

In many respects the cost of LEED comes down to what you assign to LEED
as an "extra" cost.  Many teams have figured out how to neutralize even
the added soft costs through an integrative design process.

Going back to the original question though I think (I might have misread
the two) the ACC study addresses the soft costs, while the Davis Langdon
study addresses hard costs associated with LEED, so you really can't
compare the two studies directly. 

 

Harvey makes a really good point about the building performance. I think
a large part of that goes back to usage and retro commissioning. I've
seen projects do worse than the LEED ECB predicted, but I've seen it go
the other way too (especially if the owners have energy efficiency in
mind). Very often, the users have a big part to play in which way the
energy pendulum swings.

 

I think it's important to recognize the role of the energy model as a
proactive tool rather than a reactive (or retroactive) tool. One way
LEED could improve that is to come up with best practices guidelines for
SD & DD level energy modeling. That's where the big decisions are made.
One of the drawbacks of the system right now is that you do a submittal
at the end of construction documents and call it a design submittal,
when in fact the design was mostly frozen at the start of CDs. At this
point, any reviewer comments can't be implemented into the design
process, so LEED becomes a point grabbing tool rather than the best
practices design guideline tool that it should be (and we all want it to
be). 

 

So at the risk of incurring the wrath of my entire profession (who think
that there is too much paperwork anyway), how about incorporating a true
design submittal halfway through the design process?

Hello all,

 

We are working on a project in Georgia that is served by Georgia Power. Their utility rate is structured as below. 

 

In eQUEST, the problem arises because there is a an energy tier within a kWh/kW tier. eQUEST will not let the Step Size in the KWH/KW Block Charge.

 

How do you set different kWh limits within a set kWh/kW hours? 

 

There was a previous thread on this subject in 2004, but nothing came out of it for eQUEST, as the recommended flag schedule is not what this rate is asking for. http://lists.onebuilding.org/htdig.cgi/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2004-March/001493.html

 

Any help would be appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Dana

Thank all of you for your contribution.  

 

What may also be of interest here is that I came across the ACC study while
reading an article entitled "Collaboration, Project Management, and Project
Information Management Solutions in AEC" :

 

http://www.aecbytes.com/feature/2009/Collaboration_PM_PIM_Solutions.html.

 

Written in February 2009, the article reviewed a selection of Project
Management tools and mentioned that one customer-requested enhancement of
Newforma Project Center was to improve LEED certification administration;
and I quote:

 

"Newforma Project Center Sixth Edition has several features that can help to
reduce these costs and make the process more efficient, including the
ability to clearly assign LEED roles and responsibilities, capture tasks as
action items, easily file incoming email to the appropriate action item, and
conveniently re-assign action items for follow-up via email notifications.
The current status of a LEED-related action item can be seen at all times,
and reports can be quickly generated to keep all team members informed.
Action items can now be associated with milestones in the project timeline
(see Figure 1), allowing more efficient execution of LEED-related
processes."

 

It seems this tool is suggesting that the LEED certification can be improved
by changing the administration of the whole process.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Cost of LEED certification

 

 

Going back to the original question though I think (I might have misread the
two) the ACC study addresses the soft costs, while the Davis Langdon study
addresses hard costs associated with LEED, so you really can't compare the
two studies directly. 

 

Harvey makes a really good point about the building performance. I think a
large part of that goes back to usage and retro commissioning. I've seen
projects do worse than the LEED ECB predicted, but I've seen it go the other
way too (especially if the owners have energy efficiency in mind). Very
often, the users have a big part to play in which way the energy pendulum
swings.

 

I think it's important to recognize the role of the energy model as a
proactive tool rather than a reactive (or retroactive) tool. One way LEED
could improve that is to come up with best practices guidelines for SD & DD
level energy modeling. That's where the big decisions are made. One of the
drawbacks of the system right now is that you do a submittal at the end of
construction documents and call it a design submittal, when in fact the
design was mostly frozen at the start of CDs. At this point, any reviewer
comments can't be implemented into the design process, so LEED becomes a
point grabbing tool rather than the best practices design guideline tool
that it should be (and we all want it to be). 

 

So at the risk of incurring the wrath of my entire profession (who think
that there is too much paperwork anyway), how about incorporating a true
design submittal halfway through the design process?

On your last point I agree whole-heartedly!

 

Without entering that data quagmire, I suggest that we all need to do a
better job of understanding building energy use, gathering more data,
connecting modeled and actual performance, developing better tools,
producing more informed modelers, creating performance feedback loops for
designers, developing better metrics, etc. to make sure LEED and other
systems produce the right signals and improve performance.

 

If anyone has any thoughts on how to improve LEED to ensure better
performance feel free to pitch in and help us make it better.

While the cost of LEED Certification is important, equally important are how
well are LEED projects performing. The New Buildings Institute study (March
2008) of 121 LEED NC v2 buildings certified through 2006 claimed "on average
LEED energy use 25-30% better than the National Average." However a number

done nothing to lower building primary energy consumption and associated GHG
emission." I have attached his paper which will be presented at the
International Energy Program Evaluation Conference scheduled for Portland,
OR. August 11-14, 2009. 

 

I believe that the Bldg-Sim community needs to address this issue. Otherwise
the services that we perform will become seriously questioned by the
building profession. Even if LEED buildings cost more, which I believe most
building professionals and clients would accept. It is unacceptable if they
can't deliver on energy performance.

Paul without seeing the articles to which you refer I really can't comment
about the comparison of the studies.  

 

Regarding cost and LEED I can offer my own personal experience on more than
100 commercial projects pursuing LEED certification - none has even come
close to approaching the bottom end of the cost range in the ACC study.  I
have no doubt that some projects are spending 4.5% to 11% more but frankly
they are using LEED the wrong way (as a checklist of independent variables
in a point hunting exercise) and the market will weed those practitioners
out over time.  All things being equal LEED does add cost but it is only the
measuring tool.  The real question is does a high performance green building
cost more?  If done correctly my experience is that it does not.

 

We are currently working on a school project which is borderline Platinum.
It was bid last summer and came in significantly under budget and attracted
a $500,000 state grant.  So the actual cost is less than conventional
overall even without the grant.  Project cost drivers are primarily a
function of building type and location.  Within those broad categories it is
about design choices, one can choose to focus resources on building
performance or on other priorities.  Project teams who choose to focus on
the priorities spelled out in LEED can easily do so within the confines of a
conventional project budget.  The rest is just a bit of paperwork.

 

The first time that an architectural firm had to use CAD drawings instead of
hand-drawn; the first time they had to comply with ADA; when major building
code changes occur - all of these things resulted in added costs.  As
experience is gained costs come down significantly and the same thing is
happening with LEED (the ACC study indicates that this was likely to
happen).

 

The real answer to your question is - "it depends" - on many factors
including team experience, priorities, project size, strategies, design
process, etc.  You really can't assume it costs more but if you do, it
probably will.

I have scanned the Langdon document and even looked at later articles
written on the topic.  They agree that the Langdon study is more
comprehensive but still gravitate towards the costing provided by the
American Chemistry Council. My take on the matter is that the real issue
here is not whether LEED certification costs more, but how much does it

Anyone's first LEED project requires an investment of time to learn how to
do it.  This learning curve is somewhat steep but once you learn how to do,
actually doing it takes considerably less time.  Outside soft costs
(commissioning, energy modeling and LEED documentation) if you are spending
a dime more for construction costs than conventional for LEED Certified or
Silver then you have made an optional choice or are not properly applying
the system.  Many projects attain the Gold certification level without an
increase in construction costs.  

 

There have been several cost studies over the years than do not show that
LEED requires the type of investment purported by the American Chemistry
Council.  Here are some links:

 

http://www.cap-e.com/publications/default.cfm

http://www.davislangdon.com/USA/Research/ResearchFinder/2007-The-Cost-of-Gre
en-Revisited/

 

The Davis Langdon study above is far more thorough and comprehensive than
the much older ACC report which relies on a considerable amount of early
anecdotal evidence.

 

In many respects the cost of LEED comes down to what you assign to LEED as
an "extra" cost.  Many teams have figured out how to neutralize even the
added soft costs through an integrative design process.

I agree with Harvey and further recommend a recent paper by Newsham et.
al. in Energy and Buildings titled  'Do LEED-certified buildings save
energy? Yes, but...' ( doi:10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.03.014
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.03.014> ). The authors also
conducted a re-analysis of data supplied by the New Buildings Institute.
They found that 'On average, LEED buildings used 18-39% less energy per
floor area than their conventional counterparts. However, 28-35% of LEED
buildings used more energy than their conventional counterparts.'
Somewhat sobering news for owners of LEED buildings.

I believe that the Bldg-Sim community needs to address this issue.
Otherwise the services that we perform will become seriously questioned
by the building profession. Even if LEED buildings cost more, which I
believe most building professionals and clients would accept. It is
unacceptable if they can't deliver on energy performance.

Paul without seeing the articles to which you refer I really can't
comment about the comparison of the studies.  

 

Regarding cost and LEED I can offer my own personal experience on more
than 100 commercial projects pursuing LEED certification - none has even
come close to approaching the bottom end of the cost range in the ACC
study.  I have no doubt that some projects are spending 4.5% to 11% more
but frankly they are using LEED the wrong way (as a checklist of
independent variables in a point hunting exercise) and the market will
weed those practitioners out over time.  All things being equal LEED
does add cost but it is only the measuring tool.  The real question is
does a high performance green building cost more?  If done correctly my
experience is that it does not.

 

We are currently working on a school project which is borderline
Platinum.  It was bid last summer and came in significantly under budget
and attracted a $500,000 state grant.  So the actual cost is less than
conventional overall even without the grant.  Project cost drivers are
primarily a function of building type and location.  Within those broad
categories it is about design choices, one can choose to focus resources
on building performance or on other priorities.  Project teams who
choose to focus on the priorities spelled out in LEED can easily do so
within the confines of a conventional project budget.  The rest is just
a bit of paperwork.

 

The first time that an architectural firm had to use CAD drawings
instead of hand-drawn; the first time they had to comply with ADA; when
major building code changes occur - all of these things resulted in
added costs.  As experience is gained costs come down significantly and
the same thing is happening with LEED (the ACC study indicates that this
was likely to happen).

 

The real answer to your question is - "it depends" - on many factors
including team experience, priorities, project size, strategies, design
process, etc.  You really can't assume it costs more but if you do, it
probably will.

Thanks for the links Marcus.  

 

I have scanned the Langdon document and even looked at later articles
written on the topic.  They agree that the Langdon study is more
comprehensive but still gravitate towards the costing provided by the
American Chemistry Council. My take on the matter is that the real issue
here is not whether LEED certification costs more, but how much does it
cost: both in terms of time and expense.

Anyone's first LEED project requires an investment of time to learn how
to do it.  This learning curve is somewhat steep but once you learn how
to do, actually doing it takes considerably less time.  Outside soft
costs (commissioning, energy modeling and LEED documentation) if you are
spending a dime more for construction costs than conventional for LEED
Certified or Silver then you have made an optional choice or are not
properly applying the system.  Many projects attain the Gold
certification level without an increase in construction costs.  

 

There have been several cost studies over the years than do not show
that LEED requires the type of investment purported by the American
Chemistry Council.  Here are some links:

 

http://www.cap-e.com/publications/default.cfm

http://www.davislangdon.com/USA/Research/ResearchFinder/2007-The-Cost-of
-Green-Revisited/

 

The Davis Langdon study above is far more thorough and comprehensive
than the much older ACC report which relies on a considerable amount of
early anecdotal evidence.

 

In many respects the cost of LEED comes down to what you assign to LEED
as an "extra" cost.  Many teams have figured out how to neutralize even
the added soft costs through an integrative design process.

obtaining LEED Certification, which is available online at the following

It indicates that the documentation takes 226 working hours on average
to prepare and costs between US$8,000 - US$70,000 per project: the first
project costing between US$30,000 - US$60,000.

I agree with Mr. Sheffer.

 

I know this is an energy simulation list & I am new to it but please do
not lose sight of the fact that LEED is NOT only about energy savings.
It is also about indoor air quality, recyclable/reusable material, site
selection, building orientation, and some more stuff I'm sure I forgot.
I have experienced projects that hit their budgets (non-LEED budgets).
Unfortunately there is no really accurate way to assess actual
additional LEED cost if it exists (We believe 2-4%).  If designed
correctly the building is integrated and most parts are inter-dependent.
Therefore you cannot easily VE a LEED project by changing or removing
pieces and parts.   I am LEED accredited so I have a bias towards LEED
but we are undoubtedly better designers as a result of pursuing LEED
certification.

 

I do not subscribe to the global warming conciseness and do not believe
we can save nor destroy the planet, I do believe however, we should make
fiscally and environmentally responsible decisions.  I don't want to
seem preachy but as design professionals we must always strive for
balance.  We must select among the many systems available, make
responsible decisions for each project, and remember that no building
can be perfect.

 

Articles are written by people.  People have opinions.  You know what
they say about opinions.

Paul without seeing the articles to which you refer I really can't
comment about the comparison of the studies.  

 

Regarding cost and LEED I can offer my own personal experience on more
than 100 commercial projects pursuing LEED certification - none has even
come close to approaching the bottom end of the cost range in the ACC
study.  I have no doubt that some projects are spending 4.5% to 11% more
but frankly they are using LEED the wrong way (as a checklist of
independent variables in a point hunting exercise) and the market will
weed those practitioners out over time.  All things being equal LEED
does add cost but it is only the measuring tool.  The real question is
does a high performance green building cost more?  If done correctly my
experience is that it does not.

 

We are currently working on a school project which is borderline
Platinum.  It was bid last summer and came in significantly under budget
and attracted a $500,000 state grant.  So the actual cost is less than
conventional overall even without the grant.  Project cost drivers are
primarily a function of building type and location.  Within those broad
categories it is about design choices, one can choose to focus resources
on building performance or on other priorities.  Project teams who
choose to focus on the priorities spelled out in LEED can easily do so
within the confines of a conventional project budget.  The rest is just
a bit of paperwork.

 

The first time that an architectural firm had to use CAD drawings
instead of hand-drawn; the first time they had to comply with ADA; when
major building code changes occur - all of these things resulted in
added costs.  As experience is gained costs come down significantly and
the same thing is happening with LEED (the ACC study indicates that this
was likely to happen).

 

The real answer to your question is - "it depends" - on many factors
including team experience, priorities, project size, strategies, design
process, etc.  You really can't assume it costs more but if you do, it
probably will.

Thanks for the links Marcus.  

 

I have scanned the Langdon document and even looked at later articles
written on the topic.  They agree that the Langdon study is more
comprehensive but still gravitate towards the costing provided by the
American Chemistry Council. My take on the matter is that the real issue
here is not whether LEED certification costs more, but how much does it
cost: both in terms of time and expense.

Anyone's first LEED project requires an investment of time to learn how
to do it.  This learning curve is somewhat steep but once you learn how
to do, actually doing it takes considerably less time.  Outside soft
costs (commissioning, energy modeling and LEED documentation) if you are
spending a dime more for construction costs than conventional for LEED
Certified or Silver then you have made an optional choice or are not
properly applying the system.  Many projects attain the Gold
certification level without an increase in construction costs.  

 

There have been several cost studies over the years than do not show
that LEED requires the type of investment purported by the American
Chemistry Council.  Here are some links:

 

http://www.cap-e.com/publications/default.cfm

http://www.davislangdon.com/USA/Research/ResearchFinder/2007-The-Cost-of
-Green-Revisited/

 

The Davis Langdon study above is far more thorough and comprehensive
than the much older ACC report which relies on a considerable amount of
early anecdotal evidence.

 

In many respects the cost of LEED comes down to what you assign to LEED
as an "extra" cost.  Many teams have figured out how to neutralize even
the added soft costs through an integrative design process.

I recall someone once asked about the time needed to be spent on LEED
certification.  Well, I have just come across a report prepared by
Northbridge Environmental Management Consultants
<http://www.nbenvironmental.com> entitled Analyzing the Cost of
obtaining LEED Certification, which is available online at the following
link: 

 

http://www.cleanair-coolplanet.org/for_communities/LEED_links/Analyzingt
heCostofLEED.pdf

 

It indicates that the documentation takes 226 working hours on average
to prepare and costs between US$8,000 - US$70,000 per project: the first
project costing between US$30,000 - US$60,000.

The metric in LEED (ASHRAE 90.1) is energy cost not energy usage.  I am
certain that ice storage systems have been submitted and approved in LEED
projects.  As currently set up you don't get full credit since both models
must use the same rate structure but you could get some credit against
standard cooling systems if the rate structure favors off-peak usage.

Marcus,
 
Even if the same rate structure is used in both buildings, wouldn't the
proposed building be able to take advantage of off-peak rates since its
chillers are running during the night to produce ice, instead of during
the day as in the reference building?

Yes but you don't necessarily get full credit since you are using the same
rate structure, all off-peak usage in the baseline building is modeled at
the off-peak rate as well.  To get full credit one would model an off-peak
rate in the proposed and a standard rate in the baseline which Appendix g
does not allow.

I have the task of evaluating the benefits of continuous insulation compared to insulated wall cavities.  The idea behind the continuous insulation is partly that it will make a tighter building and not allow as much infiltration.  I realize that continuous insulation eliminates the thermal break in the wall and I am able to quantify that, but I do not know of a good way to quantify the difference in infiltration.  Does anyone know of studies that have been done on building infiltration?  What values do you normally use for new construction in your energy modeling?

Is there a easy way to get eQuest to add up the OA cfm/person and OA cfm

work on the OA cfm /person quantity. Currently, eQuest seems to use the max

Also, is there a way to get eQuest to reduce the zone minimum to zero during
night time, instead of the OA cfm/sqft value as minimum when using DCV reset
up/down. I am trying to avoid pre-processing all the OA info + occupancy in
excel and generating a schedule for the system level.

I agree with Harvey too. Moreover, you can ask if LEED (and others systems)
necessarily incentive a climatic, energy-conscious architectural design to
achieve better performance buildings. I am afraid the answer is not. I
recommend the reading of a paper by Edna Shaviv in the last PLEA in Dublin,
"Passive and Low Energy Architecture (PLEA) vs. Green Architecture (LEED)". 

 

In her conclusion she states:

"The fact that all energy saving features are put in one basket, and the

I agree with Harvey and further recommend a recent paper by Newsham et. al.
in Energy and Buildings titled  'Do LEED-certified buildings save energy?
Yes, but.' (http://www.sciencedirect.com/scidirimg/clear.gif
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.03.014>
doi:10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.03.014). The authors also conducted a re-analysis
of data supplied by the New Buildings Institute. They found that 'On
average, LEED buildings used 18-39% less energy per floor area than their
conventional counterparts. However, 28-35% of LEED buildings used more
energy than their conventional counterparts.' Somewhat sobering news for
owners of LEED buildings.

Marcus and all,

 

While the cost of LEED Certification is important, equally important are how
well are LEED projects performing. The New Buildings Institute study (March
2008) of 121 LEED NC v2 buildings certified through 2006 claimed "on average
LEED energy use 25-30% better than the National Average." However a number
of critics of this study has emerged, many of whom used the same data that
NBI used. Henry Gifford has question the methodology used in the NBI study.
The American Physical Society in their Energy Future: Think Efficiency
Report as well as Joe Lstiburek has also questioned the NBI study. Now Dr.
John Scofield from Oberlin has completed a detailed re-examination of the
NBI study and has found that "the NBI data shows that LEED certification has
done nothing to lower building primary energy consumption and associated GHG
emission." I have attached his paper which will be presented at the
International Energy Program Evaluation Conference scheduled for Portland,
OR. August 11-14, 2009. 

 

I believe that the Bldg-Sim community needs to address this issue. Otherwise
the services that we perform will become seriously questioned by the
building profession. Even if LEED buildings cost more, which I believe most
building professionals and clients would accept. It is unacceptable if they
can't deliver on energy performance.

Paul without seeing the articles to which you refer I really can't comment
about the comparison of the studies.  

 

Regarding cost and LEED I can offer my own personal experience on more than
100 commercial projects pursuing LEED certification - none has even come
close to approaching the bottom end of the cost range in the ACC study.  I
have no doubt that some projects are spending 4.5% to 11% more but frankly
they are using LEED the wrong way (as a checklist of independent variables
in a point hunting exercise) and the market will weed those practitioners
out over time.  All things being equal LEED does add cost but it is only the
measuring tool.  The real question is does a high performance green building
cost more?  If done correctly my experience is that it does not.

 

We are currently working on a school project which is borderline Platinum.
It was bid last summer and came in significantly under budget and attracted
a $500,000 state grant.  So the actual cost is less than conventional
overall even without the grant.  Project cost drivers are primarily a
function of building type and location.  Within those broad categories it is
about design choices, one can choose to focus resources on building
performance or on other priorities.  Project teams who choose to focus on
the priorities spelled out in LEED can easily do so within the confines of a
conventional project budget.  The rest is just a bit of paperwork.

 

The first time that an architectural firm had to use CAD drawings instead of
hand-drawn; the first time they had to comply with ADA; when major building
code changes occur - all of these things resulted in added costs.  As
experience is gained costs come down significantly and the same thing is
happening with LEED (the ACC study indicates that this was likely to
happen).

 

The real answer to your question is - "it depends" - on many factors
including team experience, priorities, project size, strategies, design
process, etc.  You really can't assume it costs more but if you do, it
probably will.

Thanks for the links Marcus.  

 

I have scanned the Langdon document and even looked at later articles
written on the topic.  They agree that the Langdon study is more
comprehensive but still gravitate towards the costing provided by the
American Chemistry Council. My take on the matter is that the real issue
here is not whether LEED certification costs more, but how much does it
cost: both in terms of time and expense.

Anyone's first LEED project requires an investment of time to learn how to
do it.  This learning curve is somewhat steep but once you learn how to do,
actually doing it takes considerably less time.  Outside soft costs
(commissioning, energy modeling and LEED documentation) if you are spending
a dime more for construction costs than conventional for LEED Certified or
Silver then you have made an optional choice or are not properly applying
the system.  Many projects attain the Gold certification level without an
increase in construction costs.  

 

There have been several cost studies over the years than do not show that
LEED requires the type of investment purported by the American Chemistry
Council.  Here are some links:

 

http://www.cap-e.com/publications/default.cfm

http://www.davislangdon.com/USA/Research/ResearchFinder/2007-The-Cost-of-Gre
en-Revisited/

 

The Davis Langdon study above is far more thorough and comprehensive than
the much older ACC report which relies on a considerable amount of early
anecdotal evidence.

 

In many respects the cost of LEED comes down to what you assign to LEED as
an "extra" cost.  Many teams have figured out how to neutralize even the
added soft costs through an integrative design process.

Hello,
I posted this a couple of days back but perhaps wasn't specific enough. 

I am modelling a hotel in Iran for a US NC project and they will be using absorption chillers to satisfy 100% of the cooling load. I will be using ASHRAE 90.1 2004 to create the reference building, however I don't see any reference for the cooling fuel type. It is clearly stated in ASHRAE 90.1 - 1999 that the cooling fuel types will be the same in the proposed and reference building, but this is not stated in 90.1 - 2004. Does anyone have any experience modelling absorption chillers and if so, where is it stated that the cooling fuels should match.

Any assistance you could provide is much appreciated

Thank you

Julia,

 

ASHRAE 90.1 uses energy cost.

Now, when you simulate an energy model for thermal (ice storage), AND if
there is differential tariff available, I am sure that the energy usage will
be less (NOT EQUAL NOR MORE) than an ASHRAE base case building. 

Try your luck with this idea.

Do let me know if this made some sense.

The metric in LEED (ASHRAE 90.1) is energy cost not energy usage.  I am
certain that ice storage systems have been submitted and approved in LEED
projects.  As currently set up you don't get full credit since both models
must use the same rate structure but you could get some credit against
standard cooling systems if the rate structure favors off-peak usage.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED EAcr1 and ice storage?

 

Hi All,

Has anyone successfully submitted an energy model to LEED for NC, EAcr1
compliance that utilized an ice storage system for cooling?

 

I'm just curious if they considered this a valid way to meet EAcr1 since
even though these systems save money (which is the basis for EAcr 1
compliance), they frequently use the same or even more energy than a
standard chiller plant/system design.  In other words, in principle, if your
proposed building uses the same or more energy than your baseline, but shows
a $ savings relative to the baseline, is that still valid.

 

We're considering looking at ice storage for a LEED project I'm working on.
But, before we run down that route, I'm trying to determine if LEED
considers it an acceptable way to meet EAcr1 and if anyone has been
successfully awarded LEED certification with it.  I tried searching the
CIRs, but the LEED search engine didn't return any matches.  There was a
little traffic on Bldg-sim on it, but that was pretty old (2005).  I also
sent LEED customer service the questions along with a brief description of
ice storage and the not-so-green as well as green aspects of it.  But, it
was obvious by their reply that they had no idea what I was talking
about?!?!?  

 

Any experience you all have regarding ice storage and successful LEED
submittals would be great.

Thanks.

Julia

Does anyone know the rationale behind ASHRAE's change from matching fuel
types in 1999 to only using electric on 2004?
 
COPs of absorption chillers are typically below 1.0, so even if a
"renewable" fuel such as solar thermal is used (and deducted from the
EAc1 cost), it may be difficult to reduce cooling consumption compared
to electrically operated chillers in the reference building.  Has anyone
been able to get any benefit from using absorption chillers? 
 
It seems that the use of a hypothetical reference building as the
foundation of 90.1 performance comparisons, often favours very typical
HVAC systems.  Perhaps the intent of 90.1 is to increase efficiency of
conventional systems, but using the "reference building" approach as the
basis of LEED and other programs does not often reward innovative HVAC
designs.  A better approach may be to mandate specific energy intensity
targets rather than % improvement over a reference building.
 
This absorption chiller issue fits nicely into the recent  discussion
regarding the performance of LEED buildings.  One of the recent analyses
of the NBI study found that although Silver/Gold/Platinum LEED building
use less site energy than comparable CBECS buildings, they use the same
amount of source energy, possibly indicating a fuel switch/favouring to
electricity.  The use of absorption chillers would reduce the source
energy and the load on the current electricity grid, which is a double
benefit since new generation capacity often comes from gas and coal
power plants, thus increasing the GHG emissions at the source and
downstream.  However, absorption efficiencies are considerably less, so
that may even things out in the end.

Those of you who are planning on attending the IPBSA 09 Conference in
Glasgow might want to know that there are several ESP-r related events.

On the Thursday afternoon and Friday at the end of the conference (30-31
July)  there will be an ESP-r introductory workshop.  This will be a great chance for
an overview of the new 11.7 version and to talk with the experts.

On the Saturday (1 August) there will be a one day workshop on the design, creation
and use of air flow networks within ESP-r. Learn from those who have created hundreds of
flow networks and leverage your models to deal with natural and hybrid
ventilation!

See the conference web site www.bs2009.org.uk for more details on the
venu and the costs.  Note: it is possible to sign up for the workshops
even if you are not planning on attending the full conference.  We think that
many will be interested in the Applications Day so check out the details,
register on the web site and send an email to Jon Hand at the email

There will be an ESP-r Community meeting at lunch on Tuesday the 28th
of July.  We will be reviewing the current state of ESP-r and discussing
its evolution.  If you want to join in the discussions please contact Jon Hand.

On the Monday after the conference there will be a coding workshop for
those who would like to join the community of ESP-r software developers
or improve their source code work-flow.

The management of source code control can be a challenge and this workshop
will help guide you through the maze.  Those of you who have svn branches but
have not successfully contributed code might find this workshop gets you to
the top of the hill and those who have gotten lost in conflicts or in the
testing phases can learn some of the tips-of-the-trade. The coding workshop
is essentially free (we might pass around the hat for coffee). If you
want to join in please contact Jon Hand.

I did not receive any replies to this so probably there is no easy way
yet. The next question is, does any one know if I use a schedule for
min-flow at the zone level that follows the people based OA calcs, is it
same as what the DCV reset tab would do? Or does the DCV reset tab also
decide the OA for the system level.

 

Thanks

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Simulate 62.1 2007 in eQuest

 

Is there a easy way to get eQuest to add up the OA cfm/person and OA cfm
/sqft (to follow ashrae 62.1 2007) and use the DCV reset up/dowm to just
work on the OA cfm /person quantity. Currently, eQuest seems to use the
max of the two values at any given time.

Also, is there a way to get eQuest to reduce the zone minimum to zero
during night time, instead of the OA cfm/sqft value as minimum when
using DCV reset up/down. I am trying to avoid pre-processing all the OA
info + occupancy in excel and generating a schedule for the system
level.

 

Thanks for any pointers.

Dear All,

I'm working on a study. It is about the dynamic facades (building automation) . One of the fa?ade feature which I'm trying to test is the automated louvers which has a control which is connected to the HVAC and lighting system. I am trying to test this feature in a certain weather. Does anybody know an energy simulation tool that can make such simulations? Due to my architectural background, I would prefer if it is a graphic user friendly interface to a simulation engine.

Fawwaz,

 

This can be done on a number of different levels within Integrated Environmental Solutions' <Virtual Environment>. 

 

The interface is graphic, not text-based, and uses 3D models either imported from SketchUp or Revit or generated in the program. 

 

At the most basic level, you can model the louvers as "local" (associated with each particular glazed opening) interior or exterior automated shades or louvers that alter the direct and diffuse solar transmission from the sky and, separately, that reflected from the ground. These shading devices, if appropriate, can be modeled as adding differently to the daytime and nighttime insulative properties of the glazed opening. They can be controlled with simple time schedules (which could be the same schedules as for lighting) and/or according to a specified threshold of incident solar radiation and/or in keeping with formula profiles that reference the same parameters as the HVAC controls (room temperature, outdoor weather variables, etc.) or even the results from daylight sensors used for dimming interior lights. Thus the louvers could be controlled by the same inputs as the HVAC system.

 

For deeper analysis, which you might more likely use if the louvers were within the cavity of a vented double-skin facade, you can model the louvers and physical items attached to the facade and having full 3D geometry and material / thermal properties. 

 

General information regarding the <Virtual Environment> can be obtained at www.iesve.com <http://www.iesve.com/>

We are still looking for a candidate with building physics/services + building performance simulation background for an industry funded PhD studentship at Eindhoven University of Technology.

The title of the project is "Towards E+ steel-frame industrial hall: simulation support for objective prediction of energy in use". The aim is to enable an objective sustainability assessment of industrial halls and to expand building energy simulation tools with models for new construction materials, system components and possible system configurations to account for the industrial hall construction specifics, process energy production and on-site electricity generation.

Further details are available at http://www.m2i.nl/pro1/general/start.asp?i=0&j=0&k=0&p=0&itemid=387

I would appreciate it very much if you could pass on this message to potential candidates.

I assume you are taking the exam for new construction (NC)? If so, all  
you really need is the reference guide. There are a bunch of standards  
referenced in the guide (and the test), but all you need to know for  
the test are the applicable standards' names & numbers (sort of  
telling, isn't it?). If you know this reference guide, you will pass  
the test.

example, the cost of registering a LEED project, who should fill out which

I think the reference guide is quite helpful, but just too much information.  I would recommend you read the posters in the ARE forum, where a lot of LEED exam information will be posted and discussed. And, maybe some online sample exams can also help you. But you need to pay for them.

In general, I think the best way is to read thoroughly the reference guide and summarize the most important points from that book. Then memorize them and take several sample exams. If you can get 70% correct in those exams, you are ready to take the real one.

Good luck!

    Hello All,


    Sorry, if my query is not relevant to this community.



    I am a graduate from architecture, planning to go for LEED AP Exam. I would like to know the details about the exam and some reference material for the preparation, if available for the same.


    I would appreciate if anyone can guide me in providing web references, links, pdfs, etc.


    Thanks in Advance

Subject: [Bldg-sim] U-values for older buildings
Message-ID: <200906152104.n5FL40HG020936@mail384c25.carrierzone.com>

Hi to all,

When doing load calcs, manually or with a variety of programs, it 
seems the referenced materials or assemblies are for the newer types 
of construction.

Has anyone come across a good reference for buildings that were built 
in the 1930's to 1970's.

I have questions on a stucco coated wall with an inch of R-5 material 
outside of 12" of poured concrete with a furred 1/2" gypsum wall on 
the inside. I'm glad the material is on the outside of the concrete; 
I'm looking for advice on how to figure thermal benefit of the large 
thermal mass, when resizing the replacement system.

A second wall construction is 4" facebrick, 8" hollow core masonry 
block, with 1" painted plaster interior.

Any ideas on a viable U-value?

FYI. This had been done using E+ in the past. I remember attending a presentation on modeling of dynamic facades that are now incorporated in the federal building in San Francisco. You should be able to google the building for more details.

Also, if you look at pitched roofs in the 3D mode, you'll notice that
they're light colored (not dark).  This means that eQuest classifies them as
"walls" and they are counted as walls in the "details of exterior spaces"
summary.  Maybe this is where your "roof" heat loss is going too.

John-
No, I took it out.  Even as such, the Building Peak heating load is not 
nearly half of what a building of this size would be.

Karen-
The roofs were grey, I was curious about that.  One section (a wing) had a flat roof and it was dark.  As I reviewed the LS_B Report only that wing registered a roof load, so thats what got me started.

Thanks,

Vikram, you should follow the exception (c) if you have a few zones in a larger building that have special requirements, different from the bulk of the System 7.  This I think would be intended for cold rooms, server rooms, etc.

For your case with roughly 50% labs and 50% other, you may instead want to use the exception (a) to add a second system type in order to account for differences in space requirements between labs and other spaces.

The design building is probably a good guide - if you are accomplishing your proposed design with one system, then you might find some way to use one system 7.  If you have separate lab/office AHUs in the proposed design, then two systems under exception (a) may be called for.

Depending on the size of the lab, you may end up with several System type 3 or 4 in the baseline, but for larger labs I think the intention would be to make two System 7's.

You may also want to look for the Labs21 guide to Appendix G which includes some other unrelated suggestions.

USGBC also has provided some guidance on the appropriate baseline system for
large laboratories via a few CIRs.  Specifically LEED-NC CIR rulings dated
on:

 

2/27/2007 

&

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Zoning

 

Exceptions to G3.1.1:

 (c) If the baseline HVAC system type is 5, 6, 7, or 8, use separate

single-zone systems conforming with the requirements

of System 3 or System 4 (depending on building

heat source) for any zones having special pressurization

relationships, cross-contamination requirements, or code required

minimum circulation rates.

I'm modeling a building that has baseline system 7. If I read this correctly
then all lab spaces will have their own system and that system will conform
to system 3  from table g3.1.1A. Is that correct? If so - are all of my lab
spaces going to be packaged single zone units? That doesn't seem right -
especially since lab spaces are more than 50% of the building area in this
case. 

I'd appreciate anyone's help with this.

Thanks

Hi All,

 

Does anyone know where I can find a list of BESTTEST certified Building
Energy Simulation software?

 

I can only find that Energy Plus has done the test, but not that it is
BESTTest certified?

 

What about TAS 8.5, does anyone know where the BESTTest certification
is?

All the EnergyPlus testing reports are posted on the EnergyPlus web site: 
http://energyplus.gov/testing.cfm
ASHRAE Standard 140-2007 incorporates many of the IEA BESTest methods.  IEA
does not certify software--just provides tests.

Hi Ross

Typically the vendors publish their BESTEST data online. The BESTEST system is one of self-certification, not a central authorising body..... (see http://www.iea-shc.org/task34/index.html )

ASHRAE Standard 140 incorporates some of the IEA BESTEST suite and I understand over time will incorporate more. (http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/40360.pdf )

I am not aware that ASHRAE 'certify' software in the way you seek.

Hi Allison
Trace 700 can model VRV/VRF systems.
I haven't tried in Trace before, but, looks pretty easy.

I created a chilled water meter and its utility rate.?For the utility rate, all parameters are either left blank or undefined except taxes?are set?to base. After exporting the DOE2 sim report, I found there is still a charge for chiller water meter. Does anyone know why the charge is not zero for the chilled water meter?

Vikram,

If you look at LEED NC CIR ruling date 2/20/2009 you'll find a similar
situation in a hospital, that was told to use PTACs. This is a situation I
looked up a while ago. I modeled my special pressurization requirement
rooms with PTACs quickly and saw the baseline used less energy than my
proposed design with the chiller / boiler. I didn't go back to look into it
in much, I've got that on my list to do. I can only think it was because
the PTACs fan and coils cycle as needed and don't need to keep running like
the chiller and boiler in the hospital. Anyone have any other insight into
this?

Good luck Vikram.

I?m modeling a building that has baseline system 7. If I read this
correctly then all lab spaces will have their own system and that system

Vikram, you should follow the exception (c) if you have a few zones in a
larger building that have special requirements, different from the bulk of
the System 7.  This I think would be intended for cold rooms, server rooms,
etc.

For your case with roughly 50% labs and 50% other, you may instead want to
use the exception (a) to add a second system type in order to account for
differences in space requirements between labs and other spaces.

The design building is probably a good guide ? if you are accomplishing
your proposed design with one system, then you might find some way to use
one system 7.  If you have separate lab/office AHUs in the proposed design,
then two systems under exception (a) may be called for.

Depending on the size of the lab, you may end up with several System type 3
or 4 in the baseline, but for larger labs I think the intention would be to
make two System 7?s.

You may also want to look for the Labs21 guide to Appendix G which includes
some other unrelated suggestions.

Hi All,

Does anyone know where I can find a list of BESTTEST certified Building
Energy Simulation software?

I can only find that Energy Plus has done the test, but not that it is
BESTTest certified?

What about TAS 8.5, does anyone know where the BESTTest certification is?

All the EnergyPlus testing reports are posted on the EnergyPlus web site:
http://energyplus.gov/testing.cfm
ASHRAE Standard 140-2007 incorporates many of the IEA BESTest methods.  IEA
does not certify software--just provides tests.

Hi Ross

Typically the vendors publish their BESTEST data online. The BESTEST system
is one of self-certification, not a central authorising body?.. (see
http://www.iea-shc.org/task34/index.html )

ASHRAE Standard 140 incorporates some of the IEA BESTEST suite and I
understand over time will incorporate more. (
http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/40360.pdf )

I am not aware that ASHRAE ?certify? software in the way you seek.

Hi Allison
Trace 700 can model VRV/VRF systems.
I haven't tried in Trace before, but, looks pretty easy.

Hello,





We are in the very early stages of a project and are weighing the pros/cons
of a VRV/VRF system vs. geothermal. Any general lessons learned with using
VRV/VRF systems, or pros/cons of certain software packages in modeling them
for demonstrated energy savings?





Thanks,

Allison -
Unfortunately I don't yet have experience in modeling VRF systems, but I have some info... At the moment, the EnergyPro package is the only well-established package that the major VRF manufacturers stand behind as robust. Performance curves from current VRF equipment are used in that software.  You'll likely find it more cumbersome than TRACE, but TRACE's VRF system has not really been validated to my knowledge (anyone from CDS, please clarify if I'm mistaken); the VRF reps I've spoken to don't trust it.

eQUEST developer's do plan to introduce VRF in a version in the near future, but I haven't heard any recent updates on the schedule for that.  That doesn't help you now, but look for it for your next project because it'd be easier than EnergyPro in my opinion.

There are also people working on a VRF module for EnergyPlus, but only at the research level.  Someone who's working on EnergyPlus may have more info on that....

Message-ID: <7E4EF7766063EC4091542B5B3E671EC401DAE7B5@MAIL.iesve.com>

IES is now hiring a Green Building Consultant/Simulation Engineer in
their Boston and San Francisco offices.  Please see the posting below.

 

Green Building Consultant/Simulation Engineer 

  

Integrated Environmental Solutions (IES) Ltd. is an international
company (headquarters in Glasgow, Scotland with 7 global locations)
providing unique solutions to our customers.  In addition to offering
sustainability consulting services, IES is the developer of the
innovative building performance analysis software, The Virtual
Environment (The <VE>).  The demand for new and existing projects to
perform detailed thermal and energy analysis is growing rapidly and our
goal is to provide this service to our clients, or teach them to use the
<VE> as part of their building design process. We are looking for
motivated candidates to join our team in San Francisco, CA and Boston,
MA for a full-time position.  

 

The Candidates: 

*          Mechanical (HVAC) Engineer with a minimum of 3 years
professional experience.

*          Experience with building simulation software is a plus
(daylighting, thermal, computational fluid dynamics, etc.), however
experience using the <VE> is not an explicit requirement.  IES will
provide full training to the right candidate(s).

*          Strong communicators with an interest in diverse experiences
who can work directly with our clients to inform sustainable design.

*          LEED accredited professionals or a candidate with experience
on LEED projects is a plus.

 

The Role:

Play an integral role in IES's expanding international consulting team
(in our San Francisco office).  Provide creative simulation analysis for
sustainable building designs, and advise clients on the implementation
of innovative, high efficiency strategies.  You will be assisting to
redefine the industry during these exciting times, and we guarantee you
will not be bored!  Specific tasks include:

*          Participation in consulting project teams

*          Working with our software customers to successfully implement
the Virtual Environment by participating in training and offering
troubleshooting assistance

*          Research on relevant software development issues

*          Software testing

*          Developing case study content

 

Performance analysis capabilities of the <VE> and services provided by
IES's consulting group:

*          Carbon analysis/tracking

*          Daylighting

*          Energy Analysis (early stage and detailed)

*          Thermal Comfort Analysis

*          Airflows (CFD) - External/Internal

*          Water Calculations

*          The trade-offs and synergies associated with all the above.

 

Some travel may be required for face-to-face training, though this will
not represent a significant proportion of the candidate's time.

 

The benefits:

IES offers unparalleled opportunities in which to build and progress a
career in integrative design process facilitation and LEED, and the
evolving landscape of BIM + Performance Analysis with the ability to
develop both personally and professionally. Benefits include a
competitive salary; private health care; potential travel; a
contributory pension scheme (401k), life insurance, opportunity to
practice internationally, and an exciting and supportive working
environment.

 

Please send a cover letter and your resume to careers at iesve.com
<mailto:careers at iesve.com> .

 

IES is one of 100 European companies listed in The Guardian Library
House 2008 Cleantech 100, in recognition of its -beneficial
environmental impact and potential for future growth.

	Equest
Message-ID: <D5059205C686384FB7AB284C4702D16906C095DDBA@SBS1.sbwconsulting.local>

Hello-

I've been trying to get Equest to size supply airflows based on a 20 degree temperature difference (per ASHRAE 90.1) for baseline PSZ systems.  Setting the Indoor Design Temperature (DESIGN-COOL-T) and Zone Entering Min Supply Temperature (MIN-SUPPLY-T) to get the temperature difference does not seem to work.  Supply airflows are much too low (0.20 cfm/sf in many cases).  I've checked other variables to ensure that nothing else is causing these low airflows.

The only other method I know of is to go outside Equest (into the INP file) and manually enter the SIZING-METHOD variable and set it to FLOW/CAPACITY (forcing Equest to use default cooling capacity to size supply airflow) and then manually enter MAX FLOW/CAPACITY and MIN/FLOW/CAPACITY (max and min cfm/ton) to get the desired temperature difference (for 20 degree temperature difference, 545 cfm/ton).  Has anyone else had luck with this method or is there another suitable method out there?

Thanks!
Jeremy

Ross,

To add to Michael Donn's and Linda Lawrie's comments ....

U.S. Department of Energy maintains a list of software that have satisfied the requirements under the U.S. federal tax code for the purpose of qualifying software for calculating commercial building tax deductions. The requirements include submittal of ASHRAE Standard 140 test results. The listing is at: http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/qualified_software.html

In addition to that, individual software providers can post a record of their validation work on the DOE Tools directory:
http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/ (but at the moment i get an error message when i try to link there).

  Hi Ross

   

  Typically the vendors publish their BESTEST data online. The BESTEST system is one of self-certification, not a central authorising body... (see http://www.iea-shc.org/task34/index.html )

   

  ASHRAE Standard 140 incorporates some of the IEA BESTEST suite and I understand over time will incorporate more. (http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/40360.pdf )

   

  I am not aware that ASHRAE 'certify' software in the way you seek.

  Hi All,

   

  Does anyone know where I can find a list of BESTTEST certified Building Energy Simulation software?

   

  I can only find that Energy Plus has done the test, but not that it is BESTTest certified?

   

  What about TAS 8.5, does anyone know where the BESTTest certification is?

Hi All,
I am curious about how much people are currently?utilizing the gbxml interface for importing of the room and envelope data into their energy models?
The kinds of feedback/opinions I'm looking for are:
	* Are you using gbxml on none/some/most/all of your energy models?? Or, are you still finding?manual inputting of room and envelope data to be just as or more efficient...or perhaps less frustrating?? 
	* What percentage of the models that you work on would you say use gbxml imports versus manual data inputting?? 
	* Does the size, complexity and budget on the project?make a difference?
	* Does the design phase in which you start the energy modeling make a difference?
	* Are the architects you are working with even constructing BIM type models that you can?get the gbxml files from?? If so, are they constructing?clean/tight models that? produce good gbxml files for energy analysis???? 
	* If you know the arch's are going to be constructing a BIM model, does it influence what energy modeling software you use on the project?? 
Would love to hear your thoughts and experience about the current state of things?and if you are seeing things change in your part of the world.
Thanks in advance for your feedback.

Julia-

If modeled correctly you shouldn't have any problems submitting your model
with an ice storage plant. I know of a handful of buildings that have been
successfully submitted using ice storage---namely the Bank of America
Building (1 Bryant Park) in Manhattan.

Julia,

I've responded to your questions below:

Hi All,
I am curious about how much people are currently utilizing the gbxml
interface for importing of the room and envelope data into their energy
models?
The kinds of feedback/opinions I'm looking for are:
      Are you using gbxml on none/some/most/all of your energy models?  If
      we have a Revit model, we're always using GBXML to bring in spaces
      into Trace.
      Or, are you still finding manual inputting of room and envelope data
      to be just as or more efficient...or perhaps less frustrating? Some
      people prefer manual input, but it is not feasible on large scale
      projects with +2000 rooms. The amount of time would be extraordinary.
      What percentage of the models that you work on would you say use
      gbxml imports versus manual data inputting?  Previously GBXML had
      been tried but not utilized because it would give garbage output. Our
      engineers did not understand how the program thinks, and how it needs
      spaces to be entered to give usable output. I can see us going to
      GBXML for load calcs in the near future (>4 months).
      Does the size, complexity and budget on the project make a
      difference? GBXML will always save time once you have established
      your templates (in Trace). I am not familiar with other load / energy
      programs, but I'm sure they all allow you to create templates for
      rooms, airflows, Tstats, internal loads etc. Establishing accurate
      and comprehensive templates is critical to keep consistency through
      projects, and for decreasing time on projects when GBXML is
      implemented.
      Does the design phase in which you start the energy modeling make a
      difference? For SD, I'd use Ecotect, or create rooms manually. DD's
      makes sense to start using GBXML and inputting construction types,
      people counts etc.
      Are the architects you are working with even constructing BIM type
      models that you can get the gbxml files from?  If so, are they
      constructing clean/tight models that  produce good gbxml files for
      energy analysis?    90% of our architects in and out of house are in
      Revit now, all models will require some 'cleaning up'. This usually
      can be done quickly once you know how to modify a architectural
      central file to give you accurate thermal zones.
      If you know the arch's are going to be constructing a BIM model, does
      it influence what energy modeling software you use on the project?  I
      would say no. I have only been using Trace, however it has huge
      limitations energy wise, their support is a brick wall, it took me
      less than a year to know more than they know about how their program
      works, documentation is missing, etc etc. I like having a complete
      control over the model no matter what type of building, or phase it
      is in. Specifically I'm working on a large hospital complex, Trace
      will not allow for fully exhausting air from any room unless you set
      that room to be served by 100% OA, many of these rooms only need 2 OA
      ACs and 10 total ACs. Adding 8 OA ACs will increase many energy
      parameters and give you inaccurate results..  However Trace is a good
      program for load calcs, and does have many system configuration
      options available.


Would love to hear your thoughts and experience about the current state of
things and if you are seeing things change in your part of the world.


Thanks in advance for your feedback.
Julia

Hi All,

Washington State is thinking of using 90.1 Appendix G as the basis of 
a performance path to it's commercial   building energy 
code.  Looking at the base system table I was uncertain of how to 
model the base system for a typical 100000sf warehouse with gas fired 
unit heaters.  Is there a common way to interpret the system 
requirements for LEED modeling?

 From building size the base system would be package VAV with 
reheat.  Since no cooling is installed in the proposed system the 
fans on the faux cooling system must cycle.  What was confusing is 
that Appendix G requires I model the same cooling system in the 
proposed.  How does one model unit heaters with low fan power while 
also modeling VAV cooling system?

Hello,

 

I am trying to gather some information about modeling DES systems under
the LEED guidance documents. How are you inputting the thermal
efficiency of the system? Are you breaking it out into component by
component efficiencies or is there a way to have the entire system
modeled as one efficiency? What about the performance curves imbedded
into each program. Is it changed to a flat line to simulate an average
part load versus a curve?

 

Thanks in advance.

Appendix G seems to only specify that the cooling system (DX, CHW coils,
etc.) be modeled identical in the baseline and proposed buildings.  If the
fan systems are different then I would assume the baseline building would
have a standard VAV fan that ramps up and down based on load, while your
proposed building will behave like a unit heater with cooling, cycling the
fans on and off to meet the load.

Does that answer your question?

I have heard that E-Quest will NOT be approved for use by the California

Robby - the fans must cycle with occupancy, and then when the space is not
occupied the must cycle with load. They can not cycle with load only. For
Mike Kennedy's system he would need to model the baseline with VAV heating
and cooling. And also model the same system in the proposed, however you
could set the heating coil capacities to zero, not create a heating plant,
or not assign any systems to the heating plant for the VAV system. (This is
if you are using Trace 700).

Good luck.

I'm not sure I follow you.  By cycling with occupancy do you mean that the
system must provide ventilation air while occupied?  If that's the case
then the fans would never turn off during occupied hours and then would
cycle with the load during unoccupied hours.  

 

Why would you not model a heating system in the proposed building?  The
scenario is for a warehouse that has heating but no cooling.  I don't see
a requirement anywhere in Appendix G for the baseline and proposed to have
the same fan system, so I believe when it states that the same cooling
system is to be modeled in the baseline and proposed they mean just the
cooling coil and heat rejection device.

Mike,

You would keep your CUH's for heating, and you would only zero-out your
heating coils, not cooling coils (in your design case only). You would keep
both coils operating in your baseline case. Thinking about it further I
would not create a VAV heating plant for your design (I'm not sure if Trace
automatically creates one or if your require to create it in Trace). I
would just assign the heating systems to the CUH heating plant. In Trace,
your fans will cycle when occupancy is at 5% or above, realistically, if
your occupancy is never at 5% your fans will not turn on due to occupancy.
However they will cycle with load - which is how you want the system to
operate anyway. And for a warehouse I'm guessing there isn't much going on
in most of the place anyway, so setup your thermal zones / rooms so you
have your storage area separate from the loading dock and offices and you
should set yourself up pretty well.

Be sure to use good insulation on the walls and roof, 90.1 calls out for
continuous insulation, for a warehouse I'm assuming your going to be using
steel stud construction, I'd double check the arch's U, and SC values
against what the minimum are in the arch section of 90.1. Another thing -
if your lights are all on a time clock or occupancy sensors, you can take a
10% credit in lighting power (I've found this little credit is something
that is often overlooked, it's the last table in the standard).

Good luck.

Shariq Ali,

Can you really say you are modeling cooling in the base and proposed cases
if you set the cooling capacity to zero?

Hello all!
We are searching for any public reports, studies, or paper on

comparing simulation result and actual usage data concerning double skin
facade.

In korea, because both simulation and double skin facade are relatively
recent technologies,

it seems there's not much accumulated information on this issue.

If you have some advice on this issue, feel free to share with us.

Thank you in advance.

Hello

Actually I have a student finishing his MSc (next month) on this 
subject. We have a DSF test cell and his work consists on simulating the 
fa?ade's behaviour and compare it with the measurements meda at the 
facility. As soon as it will be discussed (September/October) it will be 
public and I can provide information. Meanwhile you could look into:

All,

     I wanted to clarify Scott Hackel?s comment (from Volume 19, Issue 16)
regarding TRACE?s ability to model VRF systems?

 *Unfortunately I don't yet have experience in modeling VRF systems, but I
have some info... At the moment, the EnergyPro package is the only
well-established package that the major VRF manufacturers stand behind as
robust. Performance curves from current VRF equipment are used in that
software.  You'll likely find it more cumbersome than TRACE, but TRACE's VRF
system has not really been validated to my knowledge (anyone from CDS,
please clarify if I'm mistaken); the VRF reps I've spoken to don't trust it.
*

 Since 2002, TRACE has had the capability to model VRF systems.  Through a
partnership with Daiken, we developed a cooling-only and heat pump model
based on their products at the time.  Due to continued advances in VRF
systems, our original model does not adequately represent these newer
products.  Because of this, we have developed a new model, available upon
request, which is in a more accurate biquadratic form and uses the latest
Daikin manufacturer?s data.  If anyone has any questions, feel free to call
C.D.S. support at 608-787-3926.

concerning double skin facade

 

Hello

Actually I have a student finishing his MSc (next month) on this subject. We
have a DSF test cell and his work consists on simulating the fa?ade's
behaviour and compare it with the measurements meda at the facility. As soon
as it will be discussed (September/October) it will be public and I can
provide information. Meanwhile you could look into:

M. Haase1*, F. Marques da Silva2, A. Amato3

Simulation of ventilated facades in hot and humid climates

Energy & Buildings, vol. 41 (2009), 361-373 , April









Hello all! 

 

We are searching for any public reports, studies, or paper on

 

comparing

simulation result and actual usage data concerning double skin facade.


In korea, because both simulation and double skin facade are relatively
recent technologies,

 

it seems there's not much accumulated information on this issue.

 

If you have some advice on this issue, feel free to share with us.

 

Thank you in advance.

Message-ID: <946489.1345.qm@web58108.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Hi Everyone,
?
In eQUEST, there are several curves for the corrections to EIR, PLR and Cooling Capacity in AHU with DX cooling. Are there any requirements for the 90.1 baseline building? What I found is the part-load performance for VAV fan systems in appendix G. Did I miss anything? Any help on this issue is highly appreciated.

Robby,

You are correct when you say the system must provide ventilation air while
occupied - that is a requirement in every mechanical code I've read - I
haven't read the codes from the 70's when sick-building-syndrom (SBS) was
rampant, at that time ventilation was cut down in systems, and energy was
saved, but SBS was created.

" If that?s the case then the fans would never turn off during occupied
hours and then would cycle with the load during unoccupied hours.  "
The above statement is exactly correct and how it should be modeled.

You would be modeling a heating system in the proposed building. It would
be whatever is really used (like the cabinet unit heaters).

The baseline and proposed buildings don't have to have the same fan system,
however your baseline fan system is determined by tables G3.1.1A and G3.1.1
B. Once you determine your system type from G3.1.1A go to table G3.1.1B and
look at what your system is comprised of, it will give you system type, fan
type, cooling type and heating type. Your baseline is set in stone by
ASHRAE.

Sir:

The only part load requirements in Appendix G is the VAV fans, to my knowledge. The various Tables in 90.1-2004 have only maximum efficiency standards, not part load.

The chillers have maximum and NPLV requirements. But I defy anyone to come up with a chiller curve based on a single NPLV curve.

Does this issue not extend to all equipment, including boilers?  For all
the LEED users out there, does anyone know if the USGBC / ASHRAE specify
part-load performance of chillers and boilers?  If not, do you simply
use default eQuest curves, or do you use curves from manufacturers for
the actual equipment getting installed?  

Up here in Canada, modelling rules developed for our energy standard
(MNECB) specify the curves that have to be used in the reference
building.

Message-ID: <3cbed0ed0906250216x67c385aeofd2d2ea5002ddeef@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I was reading a publication of Altamyer, Gadgil, Bauman and Kammerud,
entitled ' Correlations for convective heat transfer from room surfaces '
published in the ASHRAE Transactions. In that publications no details are
given on the CFD technique applied. Besides the 'solve the full Navier
Stokes equations' I do not find anything. There is a reference to an earlier
paper (1979, Gadgil), but it is not in their reference list.

Could anyone possibly give me an indication on whether they used DNS or RANS
(which some of the authors do in later publications)?

Thanks a lot!

Hi
 
Have read through some of the E+ reference, it appears that E+ has support
for constant and variable flow water based low temperature radiant systems
(i.e. ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:ConstantFlow &
ZoneHVAC:LowTemperatureRadiant:VariableFlow). These can be implemented by
assigning the heating/ cooling pipe to a surface in the model.
 
I'm wondering if anybody has any success with modelling Thermo (or Termo)
Deck systems using E+ features. I suspect it may be something similar to the
systems listed above, but with a few input changes.
 
Regards
 
Chris

Neeraj,
 
Look into ASHRAE Standard 55, and also the ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook.
P. Ole Fanger's work is, well, the Standard. And I think Standard 55 is
being updated soon, to better account for air motion effects. I think I
saw something about this in the last issue of the ASHRAE Journal.

Dear all,

Is there a (well documented) relationship between convective air flow

(theoretical deg. F raised for zone thermostat set-point)?

I am trying to ascertain the cooling benefit of low power high-speed
ceiling fans that are prevalent in South-East Asia. They are especially
useful in better air distribution and heat transfer from the skin of the
occupants via convection. For modeling the strategy is going to be two
fold -- [1] model the actual (low) fan power for the fans in each space
considered, and [2] model a different (higher) thermostat set-point
expectation since thermal comfort cannot be modeled in eQuest. Does this
seem okay? -- Looking for peer validation.

Thanks in advance.

Thanks Cramer, Leonard, Peter and all for your valuable time.

 

I am replying on behalf of Neeraj.He will follow it up once he is back in
town.

 

ASHARE 55 does give a bit of information about the thermal comfort in
section 5.2.3.

However the section says that the elevated speed can be used to offset the
temperature by not more than 30 C (5.40 F).

The air speed considered here is however in the range of 0.8 m/s to 1m/s.
However the ceiling fans designed in here in India

gives an air speed of about 2m/s for which the temperature that could be
offset can be more.

No specific relation as such is given as to determine the temperature that
can be offset for higher air speeds.I have referred the 

Thermal Comfort chapter of the ASHRAE Fundamentals handbook,however no
particular specifics is given as to relation between the

Air speed felt on the skin and the temperature that can be offset due to it.
Definitely the personal comfort level also varies with person to person.

If anyone knows about any other standard or reference manual giving
information on this matter or can throw more light on this it

will be greatly appreciated.

 

Meanwhile I have written to Mr. Dick Ainsley of Big Ass Fans as suggested by
Peter. If he replies I will let you all know his response.

Thanks a lot again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Any clues? -- Ceiling Fans in South East Asia

Dear all,

Is there a (well documented) relationship between convective air flow
against the skin versus the thermal comfort expectation lowered (theoretical
deg. F raised for zone thermostat set-point)?

I am trying to ascertain the cooling benefit of low power high-speed ceiling
fans that are prevalent in South-East Asia. They are especially useful in
better air distribution and heat transfer from the skin of the occupants via
convection. For modeling the strategy is going to be two fold -- [1] model
the actual (low) fan power for the fans in each space considered, and [2]
model a different (higher) thermostat set-point expectation since thermal
comfort cannot be modeled in eQuest. Does this seem okay? -- Looking for
peer validation.

Thanks in advance.

regards,
Neeraj

What this also brings out is the issue of adapting/updating the  standards and the back-end data to local/regional conditions. Is there any effort going on in India or other parts of the world that consider the local technology options and the comfort preferences while adopting the ASHRAE standards? This to me seems to be an important part of going towards low-energy buildings equation.

Thanks

Thanks Cramer, Leonard, Peter and all for your valuable time.

 

I am replying on behalf of Neeraj.He will follow it up once he is back in town.

 

ASHARE 55 does give a bit of information about the thermal comfort in section 5.2.3.

However the section says that the elevated speed can be used to offset the temperature by not more than 30 C (5.40 F).

The air speed considered here is however in the range of 0.8 m/s to 1m/s. However the ceiling fans designed in here in India

gives an air speed of about 2m/s for which the temperature that could be offset can be more.

No specific relation as such is given as to determine the temperature that can be offset for higher air speeds.I have referred the 

Thermal Comfort chapter of the ASHRAE Fundamentals handbook,however no particular specifics is given as to relation between the

Air speed felt on the skin and the temperature that can be offset due to it. Definitely the personal comfort level also varies with person to person.

If anyone knows about any other standard or reference manual giving information on this matter or can throw more light on this it

will be greatly appreciated.

 

Meanwhile I have written to Mr. Dick Ainsley of Big Ass Fans as suggested by Peter. If he replies I will let you all know his response.

Thanks a lot again.

Neeraj, 

  

Look into ASHRAE Standard 55, and also the ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook. P. Ole Fanger's work is, well, the Standard. And I think Standard 55 is being updated soon, to better account for air motion effects. I think I saw something about this in the last issue of the ASHRAE Journal.

Hi everybody:

I'm a new user of Designbuilder and I have some questions about it:

First, I have surprisingly loaded into designbuilder my material database of
LIDER (spanish official energy certification program), and I don't know how,
and I cannot do it again in other computers.

To avoid this problem, I have tried to export this loaded database to a file
so as to import it in other one, but I haven't been able to do it. Is it
possible to load a a library in Designbuilder from the "materials.dat"
file?

Thank you in advance.

Yes you can import template data from other computers and models but  
you'll need to do an export of the relevant parts of the data first.  
The only difference to this will be if the Spanish data is licenced by  
the Spanish reseller  in which case it might be limited to that  
computer possibly but it shouldn't stop you exporting the database  
items I'd have thought.

Dear colleagues:

I'd like to know how to add a balcony to my model. I have read the Block
Type - Component block help document and I still don't know how to eliminate
upper and rear surfaces of the balcony, because I add a whole component
block with 6 faces stuck to the wall (no idea how to do it other way), but I
only need the floor, the front and the sides of the balcony. I cannot remove
the "ceiling" of the balcony and the rear surface.

?does anybody know how to do it?

Another one: when I add a block corresponding to an upper floor, old roofs
become ceilings automatically. But I cannot edit the construction type! Any
suggestion?

Thank you very much.

Tim,

 

Infiltration is something we need to model in the vast majority of the
buildings we simulate.  

 

There is a mass of empirical data that has gone behind the tables provided
in the CIBSE guides, which was mostly collected by both the UK BRE and
BSRIA.  You could also try the AIVC which has a number of publications on
infiltration testing and in particular a useful book called "Numerical Data
for Air Infiltration and Natural Ventilation Calculations" by Orme,
Liddament & Wilson.  It was reprinted with amendments in 1998 and so is
slightly old now, but it is a good starting point for looking at the overall
numbers to use and the basis for why.  

 

I think you should also try CIBSE Guide A which has some useful tables on
infiltration rates to use - an example and extract of which is below (Part L
denotes UK building regulations for energy consumption):

 


Air Permeability 

Infiltration Rate (ac/h) 

	
Peak 

Average


20 (leaky) 

0.95 

0.70 


10 (Part-L 2002) 

0.50 

0.35 


7 (Part-L 2006) 

0.35 

0.25 


5 

0.25 

0.20 


3 

0.15 

0.10 

>From CIBSE Guide A Table 4.13 for 2 storey 500m2 naturally ventilated
offices, normal exposure

 

Generally if you've got a cavity wall installation the chances are the
infiltration rates unless very well monitored for construction quality will
be considerably higher than for something like a composite panel system.  We
see a lot of huge warehouse buildings that have significantly lower
infiltration rates than domestic dwellings (per m2) because of the ease of
constructing large warehouse with good detailing.

 

Hope this helps.

 

Paul

I have the task of evaluating the benefits of continuous insulation compared
to insulated wall cavities.  The idea behind the continuous insulation is
partly that it will make a tighter building and not allow as much
infiltration.  I realize that continuous insulation eliminates the thermal
break in the wall and I am able to quantify that, but I do not know of a
good way to quantify the difference in infiltration.  Does anyone know of
studies that have been done on building infiltration?  What values do you
normally use for new construction in your energy modeling?

Message-ID: <E563595CB7ABF64AAC1B3F5D25AC7601172D02@edsl-sbs01.EDSL.local>

Building-Sim users,
 
Perhaps somebody could shed some light on this issue for me.
 
In 90.1 Appendix G, Table G3.1, Section 6.f. states that credit can be taken in the proposed building for automatic controls due to daylight utilization. However:

*	
	In order to know how much of an effect daylight should have on the power used, a target luminance/lux level is required. If this target is met by daylight alone, the lighting consumption would drop to 0 (except for emergency lighting). Where daylight falls between 0 and the target lux level, lighting power can be scaled linearly.

*	
	The documentation gives no target lux levels and they cannot be derived from the baseline lighting power densities (from 90.1 Sections 9.5.1/9.6.1) without knowing the efficiencies associated with these values.

*	
	The only related luminance levels available are from the IESNA Lighting Handbook but these levels do not seem to sensibly correlate with the power densities of 90.1 Sections 9.5.1/9.6.1.  Take, for example, a drafting office.  The IESNA Lighting Handbook Section 10, Quality of the Visual Environment, suggests a lighting level of around 100fc (1076 lux).  Achieving this 100 fc with an LPD of 1.1W/ft? (11.83W/m?), i.e. that quoted for an Open Plan Office, requires a lamp with an efficiency of approximately 91 lumens/watt.  Using the same Lighting Power Density, and illuminance of 30fc for simple office tasks, we require lights that produce 27 lumens/watt.  This gives us two spaces that are classified identically, but are subject to massively different limitations when it comes to selecting lamps.

Could somebody please provide some clarification on whether it is wise to assume these lux levels while performing a Building Performance Method simulation, bearing in mind that it could affect results in an unfavourable way if lux level is overestimated (as LPD will be constant in the baseline buildings).

To further complicate things, the target footcandle level of the daylight harvesting system will vary depending on whether the space uses tasks lights or not.  With task lights, the overhead lighting system can be configured to provide an even lower target footcandle level.  I don't know the correct answer, but I've always used 30 footcandles for the target lighting level in typical office projects (most of them have task lights).  If it's a GSA project, where they are very specific about the required workspace lighting levels, you might need to use predefined owner requirements for the target levels...

Jonathan, welcome to our world. To shed some light on the issue - this is a
"gray" area that is often taken advantage of when conducting energy
analysis. Looking at the IES handbook some lighting levels for particular
rooms range from 50 to 100 fc. This seems ridiculous but lighting is
perceived. It is not a hard science, factors like interior colors, occupant
age and health (glasses ? no classes), etc all contribute to what is an
appropriate lighting level. When conducting an energy analysis engineers
need to be reasonable and set parameters for their buildings that are
within the IES range and correct for their space's use. The engineer should
also have an idea of the interior colors, reflectances, demographic of the
occupants to be using the space, know if shading will be a factor in the
facility (internal or external) etc..

If I know a space will be brightly light (because I asked the electrical
engineer on the project) I'll use the higher level. If I know they will
have task lights, I'll use a lower level. If the space has some task lights
and I am not certain of parameters, I'll use a median value. I'm sure there
are engineers that are conservative and use the upper extreme, and others
that are very loose and want to earn more energy credit and thus will use
the lower extreme. A good rule of thumb when designing parameters for the
programs we use would be give us options. Maybe call them "loose" "median"
and "conservative" and give us a list of all the room types in the IES
handbook. I use Trane Trace  and Revit, not Bentley but with Trace I wish
they had built in templates from IES, from ASHRAE, and from the AIA, for
lighting, for airflow, templates, outdoor air, etc.. it would make
conducting energy analysis a lot faster. Because this was not done by trace
or Revit, we've had to build them our selves as we work on projects. If a
software package designed for the US market had these built in (and were
accurate) it would be a huge selling point. The amount of time it takes to
build in a standards library is substantial. Trane has jumped on board
recently and released ASHRAE 90.1 equipment that meets the baseline
standard, however it does not have room templates or lighting level
templates there yet.

A question - does your energy analysis software interface with GBXML? We're
in the market for new - more accurate - software. Specifically Trace does
not do a building level air balance, and when you are using total energy
wheels your going to either over shoot or under shoot your energy savings.
This is a substantial deficiency when your building has 12+ air handlers
and is located in a very hot humid climate.

Good luck.

Message-ID: <5F662BF0C1928242BF324F3EE6C27D14B87440@exc01sfo1us.FKUSA.ORG>

Has anyone successfully created an Optics5 file and imported into Windows5 or 6? I have a pretty complex glazing system that is composed of various coated glazings, and plastic.  I think I've managed to create and save a "Laminate" made of components and adhesive layers but I don't know where to go from here.  It looks like the laminate is saved with a .usr extension.
 
When I click "Import" in Windows5, it opens up glazing.mdb but the laminate i created in Optics5 doesn't show up...
 
Any help is greatly appreciated!
 
Thanks!
Linda

WINDOW 5/WINDOW6 imports Optics database, user portion, not .usr files.  
So when you are done generating laminate, select User Database from the 
toolbar (there is choice of Main db and User db). You should be able to 
see your laminate that you generated (under Laminate category).  Then 
simply close Optics, open W5 or W6 and in Preferences, under Optical 
Data tab, click on radio button "Optics 5 User Database and make sure 
that it is UserGlazing.mdb under LBNL Shared subdir (this is all deafult 
for OPTICS, so if you did not change path in OPTICS this should work, 
otherwise you need to navigate to correct mdb file).  Then close 
preferences, go to Glass library and click on Import, select "IGDB or 
Optics User Database" from the drop down menu under Format and click 
OK.  If everything is right, you will see your laminate that you created 
in OPTICS and will be able to import it.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Does NFRC certification mean that window frame u-values
 are available for building simulation software inputs?

I've spent a month trying to pry window frame u-values from the customer
support staff of Serious Windows, a company that claims to have NFRC
certification on one of its window lines having a whole window R-value
of 11. I've been trying to explain to the folks who are supposed to be
able to get answers for me that building simulation software typically
requires that you enter both center of glass u-values and window frame
u-values so that the simulation software can approximate the whole
window u-value for any size window you enter. They claim that the frame
u-value info is not available and don't seem to be able to locate any
data that is not posted on their website (only center of class u-value
and a "whole window" u-value for an unspecified size of window).

>From the NFRC website I get the following description of the
certification process they claim to have gone through:
"How does the NFRC Product Certification process work?
First, a program participant submits product drawings and specifications
to a simulation laboratory accredited by NFRC. The "sim labs" use
approved computer software to determine energy performance ratings.
Second, the participant randomly selects a product from its production
line and sends it to an NFRC accredited testing laboratory for actual
physical testing. If the ratings derived from the physical test are
within the required tolerance of those derived from the computer
simulation, the ratings are considered valid.
Third, the sim labs and testing labs send their results to an NFRC
accredited "IA" or Independent Certification and Inspection Agency for
review.
The IA confirms that the simulation and physical testing was done
according to NFRC procedures. The IA inspects manufacturing facilities
to make sure that the products submitted for testing are the same as
those being produced.
The IA will issue a certification authorization report (CAR) to the
manufacturer after testing confirmation is completed and the participant
has signed a license agreement with NFRC.
Once the participant receives the CAR, the participant may place an NFRC
label on the product. CARs are valid for four years from the physical
test date; to maintain certification a participant shall recertify the
product within the four-year cycle and not later than six months after
certification expiration"

>From this, it sounds like the NFRC must have calculated a frame u-value
for a window they proposed to test (among other thermal performance
figures), and then compared predicted performance to actual tested
performance. Does anyone know if this is a reasonable assumption? Would
their NFRC documentation & test results either state the frame U-values
or allow one to calculate it? Would NFRC be able to provide me with the
thermal performance properties I need even if the front line staff at
this company is too incompetent to be able to figure out where to get
this information?

I realize that many of you are using simulation software that has a lot
of window frames & glazing built into it so that you can just pick a
product name from drop down menus, but many also allow inputting data
for products not found in the built-in databases, and I think you need
to be able to enter frame and glazing u-values separately then, don't
you? I am designing one of the first certified Passive Houses in the
United States, so I'm required to use the Passive House (PHPP) software
for certification, and it lacks thermal data for most of the window
products in the United States, since it was developed and used almost
exclusively in Europe before this. But from what I remember from using
Equest, Equest seemed calculate the thermal performance of glazing and
frames separately, then prorate their contributions to whole window
u-value based on the window dimensions. Also when you looked at its
built-in product libraries it had both glazing and frame u-values, I
think. So I don't think I'm asking these folks for anything special or
difficult, do you? Accurate Dorwin and Thermotech companies have
produced this info within days of the request.

Do Serious Windows show up in any of your simulation software? if so,
can you find them in the underlying window library databases and pass
the frame u-values for the 925 and 1125 series windows, for fixed,
awning, and casement windows? At least tell me if your window databases
do list frame u-values for the options you can choose from your drop
down menus, because I'm beginning to doubt my sanity. Or do you have any
other suggestions as to where I can find frame u-values for these
products if the company won't send it to me?

Thanks for your input,

Dear Christina,

Strictly (and somewhat jaded) opinion:  If you can't back up your technical
claims, you probably aren't a company I would rely on to perform as
advertised. Why bother with them at all if they can't support their claims?
