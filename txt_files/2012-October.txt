Message-ID: <7E852990EFFD3D489C27CECBD45323BE0BD0446D@alb-srv004.eypae.com>

We are looking for some information on manual J software. Is the
Wrightsoft Right J program the best available to make easy manual J load
calcs? Is Right Draw required to work with Right J or is Right J fine
all by itself? 

 

Are there any programs that can import a cad floorplan directly? In
general, what is the best (with cost in mind) program to make manual J
calculations? 

 

Thanks in advance for any responses, time is of the essence on this one
as we are to make a decision on software programs today.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Public Beta Release of the Simergy GUI for EnergyPlus
Message-ID: <506B6F23.3010102@lbl.gov>

[Apologies for cross-posting]

The Public Beta Release of Simergy, a free Graphical User Interface 
(GUI) for EnergyPlus, is now available for downloading at 
simergy-beta.lbl.gov <http://simergy-beta.lbl.gov>. The review and 
feedback period is scheduled to be complete in late 2012 and the release 
of version 1 is planned for January 2013. Simergy runs under Microsoft 
Windows and requires a high resolution wide screen for effective use.

Key Features of Simergy include:

-Loop level HVAC System Templates

-Drag and drop component-level editing of HVAC systems to adapt 
templates and build custom systems

-Geometry options

oimport IFC and gbXML (gbXML in version 1)

obuild your own geometry from base shapes or

obuild custom geometry by tracing over 2D plans (dwg/dxf) or drawing 
free form

-Create and work with multiple design alternatives within the same file

-Predefined reports and interactive visualization of EnergyPlus output

-Training and support material, including links to EnergyPlus 
documentation (updates will be posted as further content is developed).

Simergy shields the user from dealing with coordinate geometry and with 
HVAC node names; it is a productivity aid for design practitioners. We 
expect that this will encourage more use of EnergyPlus by making it 
quicker and easier to use. However, Simergy still requires some 
knowledge of EnergyPlus, particularly in this beta-testing phase. The 
target audience for version 1 of Simergy is mechanical engineers, energy 
modelers, and other technical consultants.

We strongly encourage users to review the ?10 Things to Know? page on 
the web site, read the ESSENTIAL READING file and study the written 
documentation and the videos before using Simergy. Additional 
information will be added to the website in the coming days.

Since this is a beta release, we ask that you give us feedback on your 
experience with the tool, using a simple formon the web-site (to be 
activated shortly)that links to our issue managementsystem. We would 
also like to hear your suggestions for enhancements - please email them 
to simergy-feedback at lbl.gov <mailto:simergy-feedback at lbl.gov>.

The development of Simergy is supported by US DOE, California Energy 
Commission, Infosys Technologies, Trane and Hydro-Quebec.  The 
development team consists of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 
Digital Alchemy, Infosys Technologies, Trane and Hydro-Qu?bec.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Find epw weather files
Message-ID: <CAJM9pq-_PpBVAbTcHAvz+AuUzXWJc4_na5P0n9shG9qTLV63nA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

First post here so I'd to share a tool I've just put together to find
nearest .epw file to a given location. The tool is an Excel workbook which
looks up the latitude and longitude of an entered location and gives a link
to the zip archive for closest location with an .epw file available on the
EnergyPlus website. There's more info and a download
link<http://oco-carbon.com/2012/10/03/weather-file-finder/>here.

Any comments or suggestions for improvement would be gratefully received.
I'm thinking of adding something which tells you the difference in
latitude, longitude and elevation between the two locations so you have a
better idea of whether they are similar. If anyone has other sources of
.epw files that could be added to the tool that would be great too.

I hope this comes in handy for someone.

Kind regards,

Jamie

I would check the part load performance below 50% load and ensure you  
are happy with what the default curves assume as I believe these  
curves FSEC developed may extrapolate from >50% PLR manufacturer's  
data.  There is a question whether the units cycle or continue to turn  
down, but in either case the curve we believe is not representative.   
Very tough to get part load data from manufacturer's.  Has anyone else  
overcome the limitations of manufacturer's data.  The efficiencies  
promise a lot for small commercial and multi-unit residential  
buildings yet we have relatively such poor base data ...
Regards,
Graham

I can see how you might be confused.  The table is titled: 
Electrically Operated Unitary Air Conditioners and Condensing Units - 
Minimum Efficiency Requirements.

I remember asking the same question in 1994, "this table is for 
single zone systems".

Actually a packaged single zone system is an "Electrically Operated 
Unitary Air Conditioners and Condensing Unit Constant Air Flow System".

A packaged VAV system is an  "Electrically Operated Unitary Air 
Conditioners and Condensing Units Variable Air Flow System".

The the table doesn't distinguish between single zone, multi-zone, 
constant flow, variable flow, etc.

And you are welcome.

This is the first I've heard mention of Infiltration Degree Days for 25 years. They were 
developed by LBNL back
in the mid-80's.  For technical details, please see paper, "Infiltration Degree-Days. A 
Statistic for Quantifying Infiltration-Related
Climate", by Max Sherman 1986, LBL-19237.  I don't know if anyone has tabulated IDD for 
various climates, but it's certainly
doable with any of the hourly weather files (TMY2, TMY3), etc.

Here is the agenda for the meeting Thursday.

1. Introductions - Glazer

2. Announcements - Glazer

3. Masterplanning/Predesign - Marcus Sheffer

4. Conceptual design/Schematic design - Dan Katzenberger

5. Design development/Construction documents - Chris Baker

6. Construction/Commissioning/As-built/Operations - David Reddy

7. Resources/References/Definitions - Lee DeBaillie

Some resources have been gathered so far:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqsZa_M20-ZbdGh5dWJqNnZGRHczMUpfV2J4dEd3Z3c

8. Big Picture Questions (motions from members welcome)

   a) Are we writing a document for the modeler or for the 
entire design team?

   b) Do we require specific energy efficiency measures to 
be evaluated? And if so, is previously modeling a similar 
building with that same energy efficiency measure sufficient?

   c) Does the building owner get the modeling input files 
or just the results of modeling?

   d) Are we writing a standard intended for use as a 
regulatory document?

   e) What, if anything, will be required versus recommended 
in the Standard?  Mandatory vs prescriptive?

   f) LEED v4 will require design phase modeling. Should we 
be writing this Standard in a way that allows USGBC to adopt 
it into LEED (in whole or in part)?

   g) Is the Standard limited to energy modeling or is it 
more broadly about designing energy efficient buildings?

   h) Are we going to address how to do the actual modeling 
work as opposed to what to do when within the design process?

9. Next Full SPC 209P Call November 8, 2pm-4pm Central

If you plan on attending, please register for the webinar as

Suggest adding ASHRAE Handbook chapters on energy modeling and life cycle
cost analysis and the ASHRAE comercial building energy auditing guide.
 Much of the data gathering requirements for an energy audit parallel the
data required to do a model and calibrate it for an existing building.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] WEATHER: A new free tool for creating AMY-files for
	Europe
Message-ID: <CABxu1EpH+mjysesHPT0DtUiRYwg72cXwn2YqtEZqhnDLQJdi1g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

As part of my degree project I?ve developed a tool that creates Actual
Meteorological Year (AMY) files by merging observed weather data from
Integrated Surface Database (ISD) and modeled solar radiation from the
STR?NG modeling system (developed by Swedish Meteorological and
Hydrological Institute, SMHI). Supported file formats are EnergyPlus
and IDA ICE.

Roughly, the tool covers most of Europe, excluding France (south of
Paris), Italy, Greece and everything south of that. Temporal coverage
is from Jan of 1999 to up to date for the northernmost area, the
southern area is covered from Jun of 2006.

The quality of the solar radiation data from STR?NG varies in the
geographical dimension. Roughly the model gives good result for Sweden
and Central Europe, but underestimates for coast near areas like most
of UK, Norway etc. The model performs badly for the Baltics and some
high altitude sites as well. There?s a validation figure (for Google
Erath) at the tools homepage in the help section. Even though the
solar data from STR?NG varies in quality it?s still better, for most
sites, than that provided in the ASHREAE IWEC files (which
underestimate direct solar radiation in the range of 20 to 40 % for
the area in question).

You are free to use the modeled solar radiation data from STR?NG.
Weather data from ISD may however have restrictions regarding
commercial usage, depending on country and what data is being used.
Some countries have no restrictions (UK, Norway, Netherlands and
Slovenia) others some restrictions and other have most of their
weather data restricted. There is a function in the tool that excludes
data marked as ?Additional? by WMO, this should make commercial use of
resulting weather files possible for most countries (my personal
interpretation of WMO resolution 40 Annex I). But it?s up to the end
user of the tool to read and interpret the WMO resolution 40 and check
with their National Weather Service for their data policy.  If
intentions are non-commercial the data accessed and created by this
tool can be used unrestricted for all countries in question.

Other issues: The STR?NG data are on a painfully slow server so be
patient. The ISD lack recent data for many of the German weather
stations. Observed weather data can still be acquired from other
sources (i.e. EnergyPlus real-time weather service, Wunderground) and
by using copy/paste inserted into the tool. The tool has schemes for
re-sampling, interpolating and filling data gaps.

This tool was developed for making AMY-files to be used for model
calibration.  But it would be possible to use a similar approach to
create Typical Metrological Year (TMY) files as well, at least for the
North Europe where there soon exist 13 years of free solar radiation
data available via STR?NG. Let me know if you think there?s a demand
for this kind of weather files or if you have any other comments.

Lukas Lundstr?m

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED NCv2009 - baseline for gymnasium
Message-ID: <00b001cda673$e477d1c0$ad677540$@com>

All,

 

I'm at the planning stage for a LEED NC v 2009 compliance model.  The
building is a university gymnasium with a main gym and two practice gyms.
The facility also contains locker rooms, a weight room, a sports medicine
area, offices, classrooms, and circulation spaces.  The building has two
floors above grade, plus a basement mechanical room, with a floor area of
roughly 90,000 SF.  Most of the facility is gymnasium space, the other
("non-predominant") uses do not individually total over 20,000SF in area.
The heating source is a campus steam loop fed by a central plant with
natural gas-fired steam boilers.  Cooling is by a campus chilled water loop.
Based on G3.1.1 and table G3.1.1A, the required LEED baseline HVAC system
will be System 5-Packaged VAV with Reheat - DX cooling and Hot-water fossil
fuel boiler.

 

My read on this is that, for the LEED baseline, I will have two separate
system 5's, one for each floor, with a unit heater for the basement mech
room.  Since the campus has central heating and cooling, do I use those
systems to provide heating & cooling sources for the LEED baseline, or do I
use DX cooling  and a hot water fossil fuel boiler per table G3.1.1B?

 

Thanks in advance.

Steven

USGBC released a document titled "Treatment of District or Campus
Thermal Energy in LEED v2 and LEED 2009 - Design & Construction" in
August of 2010.   This has all of the guidance you'll need for creating
a baseline and proposed design energy model for your project (it's not
that fun).  There are two options to show compliance, the first being a
building stand-alone scenario (most popular I'm guessing) and the second
an aggregate building/DES scenario.   Both of your baseline and proposed
models would utilized purchased steam and chilled water per page 11 of
the guidelines.  Here is a link to the guidelines:

Good luck with the simulation.

Look at the efficiency, this should tell you the amount of energy which turns into heat. The ones I've used in models were somewhere between 95 to 97%.  So a 97% efficient 100KVA would be at a nearly constant load of 3KVA.

I think a UPS is just a giant trickle charger on a battery.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modeling an UPS

Hello all


I'm trying to mdel an UPS (Uninterruptible Power System) but I'm not sure of what would be the power that I should model. The capacity of the UPS is 100KVA, but this capacity will be use only when a "emergency" happens, the rest of the time the UPS will be in some kind of "stand by" mode with the battery full charged, so how much it will consume while it is in this mode?

Thank you.

Hi Camilo,

John's assessment covers the majority of typical small UPS scenarios I've run into as well.  I caution you to *not* equate the term "efficiency" with losses.  That rabbit hole goes deep!  Nominal UPS efficiencies (such as 97%) typically are referencing a full-load condition.  The number plummets under partial or "no-load" (normal, sometimes) operation.  More food for thought in the resource attached.

For a smallish UPS (serving a few items in a single rack) - John's suggestion to determine a typical constant loss is the way to go.

100kVA is in a threshold that could be something more substantial.  I think you are best advised talking to a rep for the specific equipment you're dealing with to nail down losses/power drawn under *normal* operation (i.e. normal power on). This figure could be all over the place depending on the project/equipment specifics.

Once known, if you understand that consumption/loss to be effectively constant, you could treat it simply as a process load / internal heat gain for the appropriate space, similar to a space plug load.  If the losses are potentially substantial and vary with the downstream draw, as with transformer losses, you might establish a fractional efficiency curve and model the UPS just as a transformer upstream of the appropriate loads, with appropriate scheduling (I'm somewhat familiar with procedure for eQuest, but I expect there must be similar capacity on the energyplus side of things).

I've yet to encounter a modeling scenario where I was asked to include a power outage within the simulation - I expect you should focus on losses under normal operation unless told otherwise.

Best of luck!

Look at the efficiency, this should tell you the amount of energy which turns into heat. The ones I've used in models were somewhere between 95 to 97%.  So a 97% efficient 100KVA would be at a nearly constant load of 3KVA.

I think a UPS is just a giant trickle charger on a battery.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modeling an UPS

Hello all


I'm trying to mdel an UPS (Uninterruptible Power System) but I'm not sure of what would be the power that I should model. The capacity of the UPS is 100KVA, but this capacity will be use only when a "emergency" happens, the rest of the time the UPS will be in some kind of "stand by" mode with the battery full charged, so how much it will consume while it is in this mode?

Thank you.

Message-ID: <CAL7OfQ3DvQu2JhagGpf_YdiiLmt0bvObJZfpQ5wMbXruRg8hZg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm using E+ example file to test the output of E+ ideal load system
output.

In the input/output reference, it says that "the Ideal Loads Total Cooling
Energy + Ideal Loads Heat Recovery Total Cooling Energy = Ideal Loads Zone
Total Cooling Energy+ Ideal Loads Outdoor Air Total Cooling Energy", but I
found it goes wrong when I add a DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir into the
Ideal load system. The Ideal Loads Zone Total Cooling Energy+ Ideal Loads
Outdoor Air Total Cooling Energy sometimes is higher than the  Ideal Loads
Heat Recovery Total Cooling Energy( which is always 0 in this case) +Ideal
Loads Total Cooling Energy. Attachment is the simulation file. Can someone
please help me solve this problem? Thank you very much.

Best,

Hi All,

Need your advice on the following:

Our job recently requires us to run energy modelling with part load condition by using VRF system. We realised that Version 4.6 added VRF system as new features. However, we are not sure how to input the various operating conditions to get the part load profile of the equipment. Would anybody be able to advise us how this is done?

Message-ID: <7DE44783-9360-4A9B-858C-26E78AA6BB6C@gmx.net>

Hi all,

I am a bit confused by a weather data file I got from the energy plus website for Geneva, Switzerland. The field for "minute" is set to 60 for all records. The latest entry is at 24:60 on 31.12. with timezone being CET (UTC+1), which would be 1 a.m. CET on 1st of January in my understanding. Is the value of 60 minutes added to the UTC time for the timezone, but the scope of the EPW file chosen so that all EPW files represent the same time scope (1.1. 0:00UTC to 31.12. 24:00UTC)?

Cheers, Lars.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] TYM2 weather data
Message-ID: <002301cdad1a$72c795d0$5856c170$@put.poznan.pl>

Dear All,

 

1)

I have already converted TYM2 data for Poznan (PL-Poznan-Lawica-123300) from
text file to excel using:
http://sel.me.wisc.edu/trnsys/weather/tmy2data.htm.

Some of meteorological data, which are there, have additional columns named
Flag of Data Source. Dry bulb temperature is one of these data. In my file
is written that data source for dry bub temperature is E, and in TYM2 manual
(http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/pubs/tmy2/PDFs/tmy2man.pdf) I have read that it
means:

 

Modeled or estimated, except: precipitable water, calculated from

radiosonde data; dew point temperature calculated from dry bulb

temperature and relative humidity; and relative humidity

calculated from dry bulb temperature and dew point temperature

 

Could you explain me what it is mean? I expected that temperature is
measured.

 

2)

The second issue is that I would like to create my own TYM2 file to run
TRNSYS simulation with my own meteorological data. How should I model e.g.
illuminance. of maybe I don't need this value if I use in simulation only:

.         Dry bulb temperature,

.         Effective sky temperature,

.         Humidity,

.         Wind velocity and direction,

.         Atmospheric pressure,

.         Solar zenith and azimuth angle,

.         Total surface radiation,

.         Beam surface radiation,

.         Angle of incidence for surface,

.         Ground reflectance.

 

Which data (columns) do I need in TYM2 file to get above values?

 

I will be grateful for any tips!!!

Regards

Karol,
   Without knowing the specifics of which data file you are using, its 
hard to give a definitive answer. My understanding is that the original 
set of TMY2 weather files are a series of files that were developed at 
NREL for 230 or so sites in the US based on something called the Solmet 
data base. Only 30 sites actually had measured data; the rest were 
modeled, correlated, statistically processed, etc. The original set of 
TMY2 data files for those US cities should not, I think, be confused 
with the use of the TMY2 file format for weather files from other cities.

   As for your other question, there is no particular need to create a 
file that has the TMY2 format if you don't want to. Type9 is designed to 
read an interpolate data files. Radiation data read by Type9 can then be 
passed to Type16 for processing and calculation of radiation falling on 
other surfaces. This saves you the trouble of having to figure out where 
to obtain data values for the fields that you don't need in the TMY2 
format. Type15 (the weather reader/processor) is really just a 
combination of Type9 and Type16 glued together internally and given the 
ability to read a series of standard file formats (TMY, TMY2, TMY3, E+, 
etc.)
Kind regards,
  David

The only TMY2 files I'm aware are 239 files for US locations.  What is the source for the 
Poznan file that you mentioned?  Are you referring to the IWEC or IMGW file available in 
EPW format on the EnergyPlus web site?

It seems you're referring to TMY2 as a format, not a weather file type.  The TMY2 format 
was developed by NREL, and as in your quote below, it has both measured as well as 
calculated data.  To explain what the excerpt says,
the TMY2 data format contains dry-bulb, dew-point, and relative humidity. However,  
weather stations typically measure only two, mostly dry-bulb and dew-point, in which case 
the RH is calculated.  On the other hand, if the weather station measurements are dry-bulb 
and RH, then the dew-point temperature is calculated.

If you're trying to get your measurements into the TMY2 format, please note that you will 
have to calculate quite a bit of information, such as extraterrestrial radiation, three 
types of illuminances, precipitable moisture, RH, etc.
If the simulation program you're using (TRNSYS ?) doesn't read those, you could leave them 
as empty data fields.

It sounds like you're trying to strip out information from the Poznan TMY2(?) weather file 
and then combine that with your measured data.  I wouldn't recommend that because the time 
sequence is wrong,  so I don't know what you'll get in the end.

I've had a lot of experience working with various weather file formats, including TMY2.   
Let me know if you have more questions about this.

Hi Robert,

Thank you for the last discussion.

After installing the Radiance Windows (32bit) from NREL's website, I find
that there are no executable files for falsecolor.exe and rview.exe in the
bin folder. Do you know why? Has there been any change in the new version?
Thank you!

Best regards,

Hi Vaibhav,

That's because falsecolor is actually a Perl script, so it appears as "falsecolor.pl" in your radiance/bin folder, and rview was renamed "rvu.exe" a number of years ago due to a common naming conflict with an alias to vi on unix systems. The objview script has also been reimplemented in Ruby so Windows users can enjoy that utility as well.

Of course this means that to use falsecolor.pl, you need Perl installed on your system, and to use objview.rb, you need Ruby (recommend version 1.8.7) installed. Not sure if the bldg-sim list accepts attachments, so I'll send you our latest Radiance install instructions in a separate email.

Happy raytracing!

I had this same issue today. I found this PDF which helped:
https://openstudio.nrel.gov/files/Radiance_Installation_Instructions_0_9_0.pdf
I clicked the link for ActivePerl (http://www.activestate.com/activeperl),
Downloaded/Installed it and was good to go.

The only tricky step was that I needed to type "falsecolor.pl" not
"falsecolor" into the command editor.

And just for reference the error I got before was:
"'falsecolor' is not recognized as an internal or external
command, operable program or batch file."

Hope this helps!

Alex Krickx

See below for info from ASHRAE on a proposed addendum to Standard 90.1-2010.
The Appendix G baseline envelope, equipment efficiencies etc. would be frozen at 90.1-2004 values. This has obvious implications for LEED energy modeling and other Appendix G analyses.
Additionally, Appendix G can be used as a compliance path, so there would be no need to do both a PRM and ECB model for the same project.
The review period for this addendum lasts until November 26th.

Additional Compliance Path Proposed for ASHRAE/IES Energy Standard

ATLANTA - A proposed optional third path for compliance with the ASHRAE/IES energy standard would provide more flexibility for the industry.

Addendum bm to ANSI/ASHRAE/IES (Illuminating Engineering Society) Standard 90.1-2010, Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings, is currently open for public review from Oct. 12 until Nov. 26, 2012. For more information, visit www.ashrae.org/publicreviews.

The proposed addendum would add a compliance path to Standard 90.1 to allow modeling in accordance with Appendix G (Performance Rating Method), provided the percentage improvement of at least 45 percent over a baseline design. In addition, this addendum proposes to make the baseline consistent with the prescriptive requirements of 90.1-2004, and it will remain that way in future versions of the standard.

The current paths in the standard - the Energy Cost Budget method and the Performance Rating Method - can lead to different modeling protocols for different functions, according to Michael Rosenberg, a member of the Standard 90.1 committee.  All require slightly different rules, and a single project could require two or more different baselines.

"By allowing an additional compliance option, the standard provides more credit for integrated design resulting in energy savings such as efficient use of building mass, optimized building orientation, efficient HVAC&R system selection and right sizing of HVAC&R equipment," Rosenberg said. 

The baseline could stay the same for beyond code programs as well such as the U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED(r)) rating program, ANSI/ASHRAE/USGBC/IES Standard 189.1, Standard for the Design of High-Performance, Green Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings, and the federal tax incentive programs. Each simply chooses their own "% better than" target, according to Rosenberg.

"In addition, the performance path will no longer lag behind the prescriptive path as in the past it was not possible to incorporate prescriptive changes that occurred near publication date into the performance path ," he said. "It also allows for a deliberate and consistent trend for energy reduction in each version of the standard, instead of just following the prescriptive path. 

ASHRAE, founded in 1894, is a building technology society with more than 50,000 members worldwide. The Society and its members focus on building systems, energy efficiency, indoor air quality, refrigeration and sustainability within the industry. Through research, standards writing, publishing and continuing education, ASHRAE shapes tomorrow's built environment today.

Thank you Bill for drawing attention to this.  It is obvious that the 'rollback' would have big implications but is not obvious what the implications would be, especially for LEED.
Would the USGBC not allow addendum BM or would it duplicate the thresholds and points tables to have versions with and without addendum BM?  In LEED v4?  In LEED 2009?  Can the USGBC do either of those things smoothly?  Can anyone shed more light on the goal of this, please?

You can get rid of the need to add the .pl extension by "associating" .pl with the ActivePerl installation. The ActiveState installer offers that as an option when you install it, but here's a reference that shows you how to do it after the fact:

Happy falsecoloring. =8-)

P.S. We have a revised Radiance installation doc which should be up on the website soon?

In general here are some of reasons for this new approach.



*         Provides more flexibility by establishing an optional third path for compliance with Standard 90.1 (prescriptive, ECB Chapter 11, and now Appendix G)


*         Sets a permanent baseline established at a level approximately equal to the 2004 version of Standard 90.1.

o   This baseline level stays the same for all versions of 90.1 with only the "% better than requirement" changing for future versions of the standard.

o   This baseline can stay the same for beyond code programs as well such as LEED, Standard 189.1, and the federal tax incentive programs. Each simply chooses their own "% better than" target.

o   This enables ECB subcommittee work to concentrate on improving the methodology and development of tools to implement the methodology instead of trying to keep up with prescriptive improvements.

o   The performance path will no longer lag behind the prescriptive path as in the past it was not possible to incorporate prescriptive changes that occurred near publication date of each version of into the performance path. In fact Appendix G 2010 is over 30 addenda behind the prescriptive requirements of 90.1-2010!


*         Allows a single model to be used for both compliance with the standard, and beyond code programs such as LEED. Modelers will no longer to create multiple baselines for different uses (code, beyond code, etc.)


*         Allows more credit than ECB for integrated design resulting in energy savings such as:

o   Efficient use of building mass

o   Optimized building orientation

o   Efficient HVAC system selection

o   Right sizing of HVAC equipment


*         Allows for a deliberate and consistent trend for energy reduction in each new version of the Standard, instead of just following the prescriptive path.


Hope that sheds light on some of the reasons for this new approach.

Thank you Bill for drawing attention to this.  It is obvious that the 'rollback' would have big implications but is not obvious what the implications would be, especially for LEED.

Would the USGBC not allow addendum BM or would it duplicate the thresholds and points tables to have versions with and without addendum BM?  In LEED v4?  In LEED 2009?  Can the USGBC do either of those things smoothly?  Can anyone shed more light on the goal of this, please?

See below for info from ASHRAE on a proposed addendum to Standard 90.1-2010.

The Appendix G baseline envelope, equipment efficiencies etc. would be frozen at 90.1-2004 values. This has obvious implications for LEED energy modeling and other Appendix G analyses.

Additionally, Appendix G can be used as a compliance path, so there would be no need to do both a PRM and ECB model for the same project.

The review period for this addendum lasts until November 26th.



The proposed addendum is here:

Additional Compliance Path Proposed for ASHRAE/IES Energy Standard



ATLANTA - A proposed optional third path for compliance with the ASHRAE/IES energy standard would provide more flexibility for the industry.



Addendum bm to ANSI/ASHRAE/IES (Illuminating Engineering Society) Standard 90.1-2010, Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings, is currently open for public review from Oct. 12 until Nov. 26, 2012. For more information, visit www.ashrae.org/publicreviews<http://www.ashrae.org/publicreviews>.



The proposed addendum would add a compliance path to Standard 90.1 to allow modeling in accordance with Appendix G (Performance Rating Method), provided the percentage improvement of at least 45 percent over a baseline design. In addition, this addendum proposes to make the baseline consistent with the prescriptive requirements of 90.1-2004, and it will remain that way in future versions of the standard.



The current paths in the standard - the Energy Cost Budget method and the Performance Rating Method - can lead to different modeling protocols for different functions, according to Michael Rosenberg, a member of the Standard 90.1 committee.  All require slightly different rules, and a single project could require two or more different baselines.



"By allowing an additional compliance option, the standard provides more credit for integrated design resulting in energy savings such as efficient use of building mass, optimized building orientation, efficient HVAC&R system selection and right sizing of HVAC&R equipment," Rosenberg said.



The baseline could stay the same for beyond code programs as well such as the U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED(r)) rating program, ANSI/ASHRAE/USGBC/IES Standard 189.1, Standard for the Design of High-Performance, Green Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings, and the federal tax incentive programs. Each simply chooses their own "% better than" target, according to Rosenberg.



"In addition, the performance path will no longer lag behind the prescriptive path as in the past it was not possible to incorporate prescriptive changes that occurred near publication date into the performance path ," he said. "It also allows for a deliberate and consistent trend for energy reduction in each version of the standard, instead of just following the prescriptive path.



ASHRAE, founded in 1894, is a building technology society with more than 50,000 members worldwide. The Society and its members focus on building systems, energy efficiency, indoor air quality, refrigeration and sustainability within the industry. Through research, standards writing, publishing and continuing education, ASHRAE shapes tomorrow's built environment today.

of building energy simulations? What I am looking for is a system for 
document management (versions and alternatives), quality assurance and 
documentation of input and result. It would be very useful if I could

Subject: [Bldg-sim] The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed 1.2 has been
	released
Message-ID: <00a001cdb15f$8745cb00$95d16100$@gov>

We are pleased to announce the release of the Building Controls Virtual Test
Bed 1.2.

 

The following changes have been made compared to version 1.1:

 * ESP-r has been added as a client program.

* The example files have been updated for EnergyPlus 7.2. 

 * The example files have been updated for EnergyPlus 7.1. 

 * A buffer overflow has been fixed which causes the error message ***stack
smashing detected ***, followed by a termination of the client program.

* An example file has been added that describes how to convert an array of
strings into an array of doubles. 

 

The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) is a freely available
open-source software environment that allows expert users to couple
different simulation programs for co-simulation, 

and to couple simulation programs with actual hardware. For example, the
BCVTB allows to simulate a building in EnergyPlus and the HVAC and control
system in Modelica, 

while exchanging data between the software as they simulate. The BCVTB is
based on the Ptolemy II software environment. 

The BCVTB allows expert users of simulation to expand the capabilities of
individual programs by linking them to other programs. 

Due to the different programs that may be involved in distributed
simulation, familiarity with configuring programs is essential.

 

Programs that are linked to the BCVTB are

 

* the EnergyPlus whole building energy simulation program,

* the Modelica modeling and simulation environment Dymola,

* the MATLAB and Simulink tools for scientific computing,

* the Radiance ray-tracing software for lighting analysis,

* the ESP-r integrated building energy modeling program, 

 * the BACnet stack, which allows exchanging data with BACnet compliant
Building Automation System (BAS),

* the analog/digital interface USB-1208LS from Measurement Computing
Corporation that can be connected to a USB port. 

 

In addition to using programs that are coupled to Ptolemy II, Ptolemy II's
graphical modeling environment can also be used to define models for control
systems, for physical devices, 

for communication systems or for post-processing and real-time
visualization.

Hi all,

I am managing a project in which we are considering to implement radiant floor heating and cooling in a 48,000 sqft new office bldg located in Montreal.  In the clg mode, I have proposed to use the geothermal wells for passive clg of the floors.  We are using EE4 to model the bldg energy performance.  I was wondering if anyone has any tips on how to model such a system.  One of the analysis that we need to undertake is to estimate the % of sensible load that the floors will be able to absorb.  Once we do that, I think we can obtain the sensible clg loads and associated energy consumption from DOE reports and thus subtract the % of the associated energy consumption of the sensible load
.
Any input is appreciated.

Assuming you?re referring to degree day bases that are exactly equal (e.g. ?50F and 10C?  or ?68F and 20C?, then the conversion should be simply HDDF = 1.8 * HDDC and CDDF = 1.8 * CDDC, since the values are incremental above a base temperature and not an absolute temperature.  In a literal sense, these are actually Rankine DD and Kelvin DD respectively.

Can anyone tell me what the conversion equation would be for going from cooling degree days in Celsius to same in Fahrenheit?

 

Thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Estimating system matrix A from simulation engine
Message-ID: <000001cdb513$b31d2450$19576cf0$@skku.edu>

Dear all, 

 

Is there a method to estimate system matrix A (of zone or building) from
simulation engines such as E+, ESP-r??  

(The A is commonly found in state-space equation, e.g. x? = Ax + Bu.)

 

As far as I know, only system identification method can be applied in this
situation.

(but, I not sure that it is reliable)

 

If there is more advanced way or efficient way to estimate A, please let me
know. 

 

Any comments would be appreciated. 

 

Thanks in advance. 

 

Best Regards, 
Deuk-Woo Kim

You are invited to enter a building design competition with a difference!
The purpose of the competition is to promote awareness of a new breed of
optimisation tools which can help with decision making at any stage of the
design process. These tools provide powerful techniques for identifying
optimal designs that meet potentially conflicting design requirements such
as minimising environmental impact while also minimising development costs
and at the same time satisfying constraints such as providing minimum levels
of occupant comfort and daylighting. 

The competition is organised by the ADOPT

There is also a google earth file that allows you to find .epw files per
location. I haven't used it extensively, or know current it stays with
the offerings online, but I've attached it here in case anyone wants to
try it.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Find epw weather files

 

Hi all,

 

First post here so I'd to share a tool I've just put together to find
nearest .epw file to a given location. The tool is an Excel workbook
which looks up the latitude and longitude of an entered location and
gives a link to the zip archive for closest location with an .epw file
available on the EnergyPlus website. There's more info and a download
link <http://oco-carbon.com/2012/10/03/weather-file-finder/>  here.

 

Any comments or suggestions for improvement would be gratefully
received. I'm thinking of adding something which tells you the
difference in latitude, longitude and elevation between the two
locations so you have a better idea of whether they are similar. If
anyone has other sources of .epw files that could be added to the tool
that would be great too.

 

I hope this comes in handy for someone.

 

Kind regards,

 

Jamie

Message-ID: <C22856DDDE69714C994BF198163205316A4F3C3C01@DUB-EX1>

Hi all,
Please see text below for the event scheduled this Thursday at the PGE's PEC, 851 Howard St, San Francisco CA.
Best,Nikola

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
RSVP link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?fromEmail=true&formkey=dEthbnE1WUQtMUtzTXZVeVNrN1NWS2c6MQ

The SFChapter of IBPSA-USA, the Pacific Energy Center and LBNL are
partnering to organize a late-day event that explores the role of an
energy modeler in determining building energy simulation results.
eQUEST modelers with at least two years' experience are invited to
participate in a study where they will be given a short modeling
project to complete.  The models and the simulation results produced
by the different participants will be compared to gain understanding
of how user modeling decisions affect simulation results.

The event will consist of a 3-hour participatory study followed by
dinner and lectures on Quality Assurance in simulation modeling. It
will be held on Thursday, November 1, 2012 from 3:00pm to 8:30pm at
the Pacific Energy Center, 851 Howard St., San Francisco. The
schedule for the event is as follows.  Participants should bring a
laptop computer with eQuest loaded and should arrive by 3:00.
        3:00    Set-up and briefing - description of the exercise and Q&A
        3:30    Modeling exercise
        6:30    Dinner
        7:00    Presentations from Erik Kolderup and Santosh Philip on QA in
simulation
        8:00    Preliminary results of study
        8:30    End

Further details of the exercise will be sent to potential
participants shortly.  If you have any immediate questions, please
call the contact number below.

The models will be collected by email or flashdrive at the end of the
exercise and LBNL staff will perform a preliminary analysis of the
results during the dinner and QA presentations and will present
(anonymous) results prior to the end of the event.

Your participation in the study would be greatly appreciated, as the
results will help to answer the broader question of the reliability
of building energy simulation results and also contribute to the
dissertation of Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley.  Participants who wish
to receive feedback on their modeling will be provided with
statistics of how their modeling decisions compare to those of their
peers, and how their predicted energy use compares to the predictions
of other participants. All participants will receive on-line access
to the Journal of Building Performance Simulation for one year and
will be entered in a drawing to receive a free copy of Building
Performance Simulation for Design and Operation, recently published
book reviewing a range of recent developments in building simulation.
  A complementary meal will be served to those who participate in the
study.

The meeting will be open to all from 7:00pm.

Please contact Pam Berkeley at pmberkeley at gmail.com<mailto:pmberkeley at gmail.com> or 508-981-9918<tel:508-981-9918>
with any questions or comments concerning the event or the study.
(Any questions about eligibility for the study can be directed to the
same email address).

Dear Building Sim,
Does anyone have information on process loads for a cafeteria kitchen?
This is for an academic project, so any and all examples would be helpful.
We're looking for any info you can give us such as: power density,
schedule, fraction lost, latent fraction, radiant fraction.  Thank you in
advance!
Best,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Find epw weather files
Message-ID: <CAPAgWcxNzrZiumCyZQOc7U_hwqwWdvVSu+jV9H84817c9yjrTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Jamie,

Thanks for the tool. IES VE does something similar. But instead of giving
the lat/lng difference with the closest matching location with an epw file,
it tells the distance between the 2 locations, which I found useful.

Regards,
Patrick

As far as I know, only system identification method can be applied in this situation.

(but, I not sure that it is reliable)

 

If there is more advanced way or efficient way to estimate A, please let me know. 

 

Any comments would be appreciated. 

 

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] The appropriate spatial resolution of future weather
	files for building simulation
Message-ID: <4B0F9EF30FB8654F88EC762FF52FDA620B2C022E@UKEXBE02.UK.CorpLAN.net>

This paper, recently published in IBPSA's journal, the Journal of
Building Performance Simulation explores the appropriate spatial
resolution of future weather files for building simulation. It's written
by M. Eames, T. Kershaw & D. Coley.

 

Building thermal modelling packages require weather data to predict
representative internal conditions. Typically, around the world,
reference weather years of various forms are used which are created from
observations at aparticular location. However, it is unlikely that this
location is identical to that of the building. This can lead toweather
files for coastal locations being applied to inland and upland sites or
vice versa. In the UK, the UKCP09 weather generator has the ability to
produce weather at a 5 km resolution. Currently, it is unclear how
useful this extra spatial resolution will be and it is this question
that is addressed here. It is found that for both future and present
climate, the spatial variability of the weather is the dominating
factor. Although there are geographies where a low spatial resolution
can be used, there are regions where a much higher resolution is
necessary.

Holly,
Refer to:
2009 ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook: Cooking appliances information is found on pages 18.7 through 18.11.
Also refer to:
2005 ASHRAE Fundamentals and other previous editions if you are having difficulty finding specific appliances (Chapter 30).

Tables are provided that give energy rate in standby for a given rated appliance value. Rate of heat gain is quoted for sensible radiant, sensible convective, and latent as applicable. Usage factors and radiation factors are also provided. If your equipment doesn't match exactly with what's been tested you'll have to make some decisions on what would be reasonable values given the information available.

Dear Building Sim,
Does anyone have information on process loads for a cafeteria kitchen?  This is for an academic project, so any and all examples would be helpful.  We're looking for any info you can give us such as: power density, schedule, fraction lost, latent fraction, radiant fraction.  Thank you in advance!
Best,
Holly

Deuk-Woo,

I have thought of this a lot before and will outline my experience 
below, in summary, if you are looking for accurate dynamical systems 
matrices from a building energy model (other than a hand-built RC 
network model), you will probably want to learn *Modelica*. Folks in the 
Modelica community have been using this method to study dynamics and 
controls for over a decade in the automotive, aerospace, and other 
industries.

As for other simulation environments, its really up to the one you 
pick.  Remember that the equations in an energy model are an 
approximation to reality.  The numerical solution of these equations are 
yet another approximation to the dynamics in the equations.  So, if you 
are going to do system identification on the model, you are going to get 
artifacts of both approximations.  In my experience, the numerical 
solvers in programs like E+ and TRNSYS are not developed for accuracy in 
dynamics that you would need for this approach.  They are developed more 
for long term analysis and numerical stability - both of which they do a 
great job on.

I have been involved with a project to try and obtain ABCD matrices from 
*TRNSYS*.  In this project, we went into the fortran code and wrote 
extra code to perturb state variables to observe how they relax and 
obtain matrices from this.  We were successful in implementing this but 
did not trust the results because we felt the solver was overwriting the 
short term dynamics in the equations.

I also worked on ABCD matrices using *EnergyPlus*, this time using a 
different approach.  In this approach, I wrote an analytical model that 
can 'talk' to the EnergyPlus input file and .sql database files.  In the 
sql file, there is most of the information about materials (e.g. 
capacitance), as well as all the bookkeeping on view factors and which 
constructions pertain to which zones.  I wrote some scripts that read 
this file and automatically generate a linearized model.  The linearized 
model does not take any time trace information (it does take some 
operating point information).  It was a lot of work and although I trust 
the results, I wouldn't pass on the code to anyone else because it was a 
bit of a mess in the end. I have published this work this year and if 
you would like the papers, please write me personally.

A fourth data point: *IDA-ICE* is another modeling tool that has a nice 
solver should capture short term dynamics.  I asked Per Sahlin at IBPSA 
London this September if there was a way to produce ABCD matrices from 
the model and he said his customers were not interested (my paraphrasing 
- hopefully correct) - which is completely fair.  My understanding is 
that the historical intersection of control analysis and building energy 
models has been on longer time scales (e.g. setback / setpoint analysis) 
or just time trace analysis - very little stability, frequency domain, 
or other advanced traditional techniques.

Good luck!  Since I have thought of this for some time, I'd be 
interested to discuss further with you, especially if you obtain any 
good results.

Bryan
