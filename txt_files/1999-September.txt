Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Looking for a good MICROPAS compatible, residential on-site surve
	y form
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199909161848.AA481809MD76140@gard.com>

Hello all,

We have an existing residential on-site survey form in-house, but I thought
I'd just check to what else else is available out there.  I'd be especially
interested in anything that takes into account the latest Title 24 revisions
and corresponding changes to MICROPAS.

Thanks in advance for any information provided.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Solar radiation on exterior surfaces in DOE-2
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199909091306.AA060145MD74176@gard.com>

Hello:

I am trying to find a way to get an hourly listing of the total solar
radiation reaching the outside surface of exterior walls and windows that is
then used in the energy balance of the space in DOE-2.1E. Is there somebody
on the list that can help? Thanks

Kamel,

DOE-2.1E Loads hourly report variable #1 for EXTERIOR-WALL
gives the total solar radiation on the wall (direct plus
diffuse) after shading. For WINDOW, variable #11 gives
direct solar on the window and #12 gives diffuse on the
window.

Hello there

Any body know a DOE technique or which  DOE reports  can  assess the 
dynamic effect of heat transmission through opaque walls with 
different insulation configuration, e.g. outside, centre and inside.  

Thank you in advance  for your kind assistant.

A.H. Monawar
