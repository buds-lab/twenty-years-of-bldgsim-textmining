Subject: [Bldg-sim] Looking for presenters for seminar in Chicago on "Energy
 modeling of tall buildings"

Fellow building energy modelers,

I am trying to put together a seminar for Chicago on "Energy modeling of tall 
buildings".   This topic came to me during a conversation with a friend at the ASHRAE 
Conference in Seattle last month, where Peter pointed out that when buildings over 300 m  
(~ 900 ft) tall the environmental conditions (temperature, pressure, wind, solar, etc.) 
are substantially different than what's at ground level.  This is not just an interesting 
artifact, but has real implications for building energy modelers, since tall buildings 
are, ipso facto, important structures that are intensively engineered, including I presume 
a lot of energy modeling.  So far, I have two potential speakers, but am still looking for 
one or two more.  So, if you've modeled a large skyscraper with hundreds of zones and 
would like to share your experience,  please let me know within a week, since program 
submissions for Chicago are due August 11.

Dear All,

We still have a few places remaining on the DesignBuilder EnergyPlus simulation training course running in collaboration with Loughborough University in September. This face to face course is an excellent opportunity to find out how to get the most out of DesignBuilder and learn best practice modelling techniques. It is suitable for new and experienced users alike, and is structured to give you plenty of worked examples so you can 'learn by doing'. The last 2 days will be of particular interest for those needing to get up to speed with CFD and EnergyPlus HVAC system simulations.
The course is completely modular and you can choose to attend any of the 5 days according to your particular training requirements. Choose from 5 days:

*        Day 1: 1st September - Modeller.  To gain the knowledge required to confidently set up building geometry using blocks, zone up and define and select constructions and glazing.

*        Day 2: 2nd September - Basic Simulation*. Learn how to use component blocks, templates for improved modelling efficiency, heating and cooling design, basic simulation and results, solar shading, lighting, and HVAC data entry.

*        Day 3: 3rd September - Natural Ventilation & Renewables*. Modelling low environmental impact design solutions including natural ventilation, daylighting and renewables.

*        Day 4: 4th September - Daylighting & CFD*. Learn the key concepts of internal and external CFD from the basic building blocks through to using simulation data to define boundary conditions more accurately.

*        Day 5: 5th September - Introduction to Detailed HVAC*. Introducing the power of EnergyPlus HVAC modelling in DesignBuilder and getting started with detailed HVAC including HVAC templates, HVAC plant loops and our Results Viewer.
*Note that Days 2-5 all require previous experience with the modeller or attendance of Day 1.
The cost of the course is ?250 GBP per day, with significant discounts available for academia. Discounts are also available for multiple bookings. You can find out more about the Loughborough Simulation training course from:

Lots of good information in this thread, but I didn't see any reply that 
explains why low-e coatings have a direct impact on the overall u-value 
of the window.  And I saw some incorrect discussion of the radiant heat 
transfer impact of low-e coatings.  Here's my understanding.

Glass is opaque to infrared radiation (look at the detailed glass layer 
properties in most simulation software and the infrared transmittance 
will be zero).

The low-e coating is always on an inner face of the window unit, so it 
only impacts the radiant exchange between the glass layers (or in the 
case of some windows, between the glass and an inner plastic film 
layer).  Low-e coatings do not participate in the interior room radiant 
exchange or the exterior radiant exchange with the surroundings.  So you 
don't need to be concerned about any double-counting of radiant effects.

U-value is the overall heat transfer through the entire window unit 
(with no sun present) divided by the temperature difference.  The rated 
u-value includes the impact of the inside and outside convection 
coefficients.  As was said before, the heat transfer through the window 
includes conduction through the glass and gas layers, but it also 
includes the radiant heat transfer from pane to pane across the gas 
layer(s).  For a double-pane window, there's conduction through a pane 
of glass, then conduction *and radiation* through the gas layer, then 
conduction through the second pane of glass.  This is why the low-e 
coating has a direct impact on the u-value, regardless of how interior 
and exterior radiant exchange is modeled.

This FSEC page has a nice diagram and explanation of window coatings.

I suspected that Low-e coatings would NOT save energy in the far North since they would block the wanted solar heat gain.  Since the manufacturers are claiming a U-value improvement from the Low-e coating, It looks like I can't calculate the savings using our normal energy modeling software. If the U-value improvement they give is in lieu of a more direct calculation method, and is accepted by the community (you all), then I will accept and move on to the next problem.

Mike, Randy

This has been an interesting thread, here is my 3 cents to add to it.



If you only want to read one sentence:  1) Low-E coatings really do save
energy; 2) the NFRC data on coating properties and the modeling tools to
predict thermophysical properties e.g. U, are well validated and give
accurate, meaningful results, and 3) the annual energy modeling tools do a
decent job of predicting overall performance- assuming you get the details
right.



Some comments on the earlier part of the thread:

Randy- "how can a thin coating have so much effect"-- You are assuming that
the U value is classic 'conduction' where thickness is directly correlated
to heat transfer such as with foam. In windows the U is an overall
conductance that includes 1) environment to outer glass heat transfer (
driven by convection and long wave radiation; 2) glass to glass heat
transfer through the IGU - including coatings, gases, other internal
gadgets ( conduction, convection and long waver radiation) and 3) inner
glass to room ( convection and long wave IR.



   There is a simple diagram that shows this (Fig 3.1) in the WINDOW users
manual  -download at
http://windows.lbl.gov/software/NFRC/SimMan/NFRCSim6.3-2013-07-Manual.pdf

( you can find similar diagrams in ASHRAE or engineering texts)



The total U of the window is determined by the details of the 3 components
listed above- in series (and to further simplify we are talking about glass
only here, then you have to add edge, frames etc in parallel- the NFRC
number has all this). Depending on specific conditions, e.g wind speed,
different mechanisms may dominate- with a high windspeed outside the long
wave radiative contribution is proportionately small; with still air
outside it's the largest effect.  *Inside* an IGU (between the panes) the
 largest component of heat transfer is normally long wave radiation
exchange- thats why a very thin low-E coating is so effective in reducing
the overall window U- it reduces the radiative component by over 90% and
since thats about half the total it reduces the overall conductance across
the gap by about 40%; you still have conduction/convection in the gap- and
you can reduce that by another ~20% by adding argon gas in place of air. (
All of this depends on temp, gap width etc but this is the basic picture;
you can also go to an evacuated gap- then no convection and conduction and
the heat transfer is largely radiation but with conduction through the
little spacers that keep the glass from touching?).



The WINDOW software calcs have 30 years of lab and field validation behind
them and they are accurate re U, SHGC etc. The NFRC whole window ratings
are for specific sizes- if you vary the window size you change the ratio of
glass to frame and that will generally change the numbers- WINDOW can tell
you how much if you need that info.  You still need to be careful how
window properties are used in the hourly calculations of an annual
simulation model- you should not be using the NFRC rated values for that
directly because they are calculated at a fixed (extreme) external temp and
15 mph wind - not typical of most climates and buildings.  Each annual
energy program has its own method for determining a proper inpact of hourly
wind/temp effects if you import a ?U?; some like EnergyPlus do the
calculations themselves internally or import WINDOW files.



Finally you will find some variation in where and how low-E coatings are
used in a window. Most of the time they are used on one side of the air gap
in the IGU- this is because 1) that's where they do the most good
thermally, and 2) they are protected from exposure and degradation. Some of
the more durable versions are now used in the #4 surface- facing the room-
this has some value since the air is normally still in the inside but there
are some other effects to watch for- the coating will lower the interior
surface temperature and you might get condensation in rooms with a lot of
moisture.  More importantly the coatings are also tuned to control solar
heat gain- the majority of coatings sold are low SHGC although most
manufacturers offer high SHGC versions also- the ?winter? night time effect
on U is about the same but the impact on solar gain is dramatically
different.  The coating position inside the IGU  (#2 vs #3 surface) has
some bearing on the overall SHGC but none on the U.  The good news is we
have a vast set of products to chose from when you add all the coatings,
substrates and configurations- so solutions can be tuned to meet varying
needs- thats what architects and engineers are hired to do.  But it does
require that the proper performance data and tools be available to select
the best match.



There are numerous technical papers on the details of the coatings,
validation of WINDOW, field performance of low E, etc.- if you cant find
what you want email me.  Two more general, design oriented sources are
www.efficientwindows.org (residential) and www.commercialwindows.org
(commercial) - both have background info, data and tools to assess impacts.

The NFRC U-value accounts for radiant heat transfer across the gap between the two panes, 
not the radiant exchange between the outside surface of the glazing and the outside 
conditions. Therefore, there is no double-counting.

All corrections and expansions most appreciated and Mike properly pointed out that my mentioning the interior and exterior exchange of radiant energy is somewhat extraneous to the discussion at hand.

One hair-splitting correction to Mike's addition: Glass is not completely opaque to infrared radiation. Of course, IR is a band of wavelengths and the shorter wavelength end of this spectrum makes it through glass (Near-IR). What we're really talking about here is thermal radiation and the ability of glass to absorb/reflect that spectrum of energy. Low emissivity coatings increase the reflectivity of the applied surface to thermal radiation. Smooth uncoated glass has an emissivity of about 0.90 and the e-coatings have an emissivity in the 0.04 range. Low emissivity coatings allow visible light through but reflect specific wavelengths of electromagnetic energy that is radiative "heat".

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] How can Low-e glass have dramatically lower U-Value?

Lots of good information in this thread, but I didn't see any reply that explains why low-e coatings have a direct impact on the overall u-value of the window.  And I saw some incorrect discussion of the radiant heat transfer impact of low-e coatings.  Here's my understanding.

Glass is opaque to infrared radiation (look at the detailed glass layer properties in most simulation software and the infrared transmittance will be zero).

The low-e coating is always on an inner face of the window unit, so it only impacts the radiant exchange between the glass layers (or in the case of some windows, between the glass and an inner plastic film layer).  Low-e coatings do not participate in the interior room radiant exchange or the exterior radiant exchange with the surroundings.  So you don't need to be concerned about any double-counting of radiant effects.

U-value is the overall heat transfer through the entire window unit (with no sun present) divided by the temperature difference.  The rated u-value includes the impact of the inside and outside convection coefficients.  As was said before, the heat transfer through the window includes conduction through the glass and gas layers, but it also includes the radiant heat transfer from pane to pane across the gas layer(s).  For a double-pane window, there's conduction through a pane of glass, then conduction *and radiation* through the gas layer, then conduction through the second pane of glass.  This is why the low-e coating has a direct impact on the u-value, regardless of how interior and exterior radiant exchange is modeled.

This FSEC page has a nice diagram and explanation of window coatings.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] interstitial blinds shading
Message-ID: <CAOQXAFCO4dNhgUBUX7OoRb3eBKqaiEj_cW3xe4CC-WgVOyno_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I'm aware that there is some cutting edge stuff being done on this. I am
interested in this, but also in commercial modeller's experiences - i.e.
mainstream practice.

I'd just like to throw a few questions out there:

   1. Does anybody model these regularly?
   2. What are the merits of simple vs more computationally expensive
   modelling methods (e.g. Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function)?
   3. Are there any well recognized (i.e. mature/ main stream) standards
   covering blind/ shade glazing combinations?
   4. What are the relative merits (if any) of expressing Blind / glazing
   combinations as a simple SHGC? Or is this outside the remit of the standard
   completely?
   5. What are your experiences of glazing suppliers providing accurate
   data?

Kind regards

Chris Yates

Chris,

That's an interesting question -- I haven't done any modeling of
interstitial blinds myself, but I think that Window might be able to do
this? I know that it has functionality for modeling "advanced shading",
though I haven't personally explored it much. Someone else who is
well-versed in that program can weigh in on this.

Would be good to get some clarification on your question though -- you
mentioned the BSDF, which so far as I know is mainly used in a daylight
modeling context. Are you mainly interested in the daylight quality aspects
of interstitial blinds, or are you thinking mostly about SHGC and
subsequent cooling energy in the space? If the latter, I think a simple
calc/model would likely get you close enough without needing to delve into
too much detail.

It is primarily on heat gain and operative temp near to the glazing. I
wasn't aware that BSDF was limited to daylight - need to read the e+
documents with my glasses on next time!

Actually, I think you're correct that the BSDF can be applied to thermal
simulations. A cursory Google search reveals some research into using BSDF
in the way you're talking about, but the widespread use is largely for
visual rendering/daylighting realm. One abstract I found indicates that
Window 7 produces BSDF functions, which demonstrates the utility of that
software for your purposes. I think next steps would be to figure out if
you can get Window 7 to simulate interstitial shades. If yes, then you'd
end up with a generally applicable SHGC that would probably be pretty good
for whatever modeling software you'd be using for larger (building) scale
questions. The good thing is that Window 7 also outputs surface
temperatures, which I think speaks to your interest in understanding
operative temperature near the windows.

Thanks Michael

I've steered away from using later versions of window. In fact, I haven't
even used window 5 for over a year. However, this seems to warrant some
serious attention. I'll keep you posted.

Hi!

Not regularly, but I have done that for some daylighting simulation. In 
that case, the blinds for rather diffuse and the modeling was not too 
complicated.

I am familiar mostly with daylighting applications. You have basically 
three options there. First - geometric model. Leads to lots of geometry, 
and expensive computation and wrong even wrong results under certain 
circumstances (e.g. specular curved blinds and backwards tracing). 
Second - BSDF computed from geometric model. Low-res BSDF (as in Window) 
allow very (!!!) efficient calculations, including annual performance 
assessments, and replace the whole geometry by a material specification 
at the cost of low angular resolutions (e.g. not for glare studies). 
High-res BSDF does not allow the same efficiency for annual simulations, 
but keeps angular resolution. Third - BSDF measured. This ones gets 
clostest to the truth, including all the forgotten effects such as 
manufacturing tolerances, glare and shading caused by detail you would 
not model - and you do not have to believe in the specs, you measure them.

I would be interested if there are systematic works on this, too!

We are doing BSDF measurements at very high angular resolutions for 
visible light and near infrared at our lab. We are doing so to 
characterize the transmission through the whole unit. However, the 
measurement is covering only radiative transfer, and will not give you 
information about anything inside the unit, which is treated as a black 
box in that case.

Cheers, Lars.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Clarification of Reference Building's Heating Plant for
 MNECB 1997 LEED NC Compliance
Message-ID: <DUB126-W135B72E4E285E84A9AC863E0EE0@phx.gbl>

Hi all,
 
I am looking for clarification of what the reference building?s heating plant should be in accordance with MNECB 1997 for LEED Canada NC compliance. 
 
The proposed building?s heating plant is a central GSHP system, supplying hot water to heating coils in individual constant volume AHUs and also zone reheat coils. The GSHP system will also have auxiliary electric back-up boilers when the GSHP system is unable to provide 100% heating capacity.
 
According to the ?Performance Compliance for Buildings? document, ?Table 5.4.1.B Reference Case: System AHU2-Multiple Zone? states:
 
1)      If the proposed design is electric heat, then electric resistance heat (see Article 5.4.7.1)
2)      If the proposed design is a heat pump, then see Article 5.4.7.2
3)      If the proposed design is fuel fired and not hydronic, then fuel fired furnace (see Article 5.4.7.3)
4)      If the proposed design is hydronic, then hot water boiler (see Article 5.4.7.2)
 
My initial thought process is that it will be (2), so according to Article 5.4.7.2:
 
?If, for the proposed design, the secondary system is an electric heat pump and none of the heating capacity for auxiliary heating or terminal heating in thermal blocks served by the secondary system is from a source having an energy source adjustment factor (from Appendix D of the code) less than that for ?heat pump?, then the corresponding secondary system for the reference case shall be electric heat pump having a constant COP equal to the reciprocal of the energy source adjustment factor for heat pump?.
 
However ?secondary system? to me implies terminal heat pumps which the proposed design is not. So according to (4) hydronic hot water boiler, Article 5.4.7.2 states:
 
?If, for the proposed design, the secondary system heating or terminal heating in thermal blocks served by the secondary system includes capacity that is hydronic, except in the case of an air-to-air heat pump, then the corresponding secondary system for the reference case shall be hydronic with a fuel fired heating plant with the fuel for the reference system heating plant being the same as the proposed design.
 
So the reference building?s heating plant should be hydronic with electric boilers. Would this be the correct assumption?
 
Thanks in advance for any comments.

Hi D?nal,

Your case will be more complicated if your backup boiler using an energy
source other than electricity and it will be triggered in the simulation. I
believe your assumption is correct  and the baseline heating plant is an
electric hot water boiler.

Hi,

 

I agree.  For what its worth I?ve done central GSHP systems in EE4 and it
uses an electric boiler feeding hydronic heating coils in the AHUs for the
reference building.  We also had an electric backup/supplemental boiler.

The CIB Middle East and North Africa
 Research Network CIB-MENA is organizing? its first international 
conference ?Smart, Sustainable and Healthy Cities?, which will be held 
in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates from 14 to 16 December 2014.?? We 
would like to invite you to submit your abstract/paper in the 
forthcoming conference.?? This conference will provide an excellent 
opportunity for everyone involved in the design, planning, construction,
 and management of the built environment to share research, best 
practices, experiences, technologies, and policies applicable, and 
offering solutions to the challenges of cities in the 21st century. More
 information in the call for papers below.

Theme
Cities
 in the Middle East and North Africa, like cities in other parts of the 
world, are experiencing an unprecedented wave of urbanization.? This 
urbanization is forecast to continue and intensify in 
the next decades.? Many old cities are mushrooming to incomprehensible 
sizes and are forecast to approach or exceed 40 million people in the 
coming decade.? In other cases instant cities have emerged and developed
 from wilderness to full urban status within a single generation.

This
 rapid development poses a great challenge for all those involved in the
 design, planning, construction, and management of the built environment
 in order to provide sustainable, livable, equitable, and viable cities 
for all people. These challenges are so diverse and range from 
retrofitting existing building stock and infrastructure to the design 
and construction of new developments. They are also so diverse that they
 requires innovative interventions at different levels starting from 
urban and infra-structure planning on one end of the scale to interior 
design and material science on the other end of the 
scale with many other levels in-between including architecture, civil 
engineering, urban design, and landscape architecture.? The challenges 
are also so diverse that sustaining cities will not be possible without 
interdisciplinary efforts. Decision makers will need to involve 
multidisciplinary teams of planners, architects, engineers, environmentalists,
 scientists and economists to sustain the growth of these centers that 
are shaped by global factors, and aspire to retain local identities.? 
This conference will provide an excellent opportunity for everyone 
involved in the design, planning, construction, and management of the 
built environment to share research, best practices, experiences, 
technologies, and policies applicable, and offering solutions to the 
challenges of cities in the 21st century.

Hi,
 
I agree.  For what its worth I?ve done central GSHP systems in EE4 and it uses an electric boiler feeding hydronic heating coils in the AHUs for the reference building.  We also had an electric backup/supplemental boiler.

Hi D?nal, 

 

Your case will be more complicated if your backup boiler using an energy source other than electricity and it will be triggered in the simulation. I believe your assumption is correct  and the baseline heating plant is an electric hot water boiler.

Hi all,
 
I am looking for clarification of what the reference building?s heating plant should be in accordance with MNECB 1997 for LEED Canada NC compliance. 
 
The proposed building?s heating plant is a central GSHP system, supplying hot water to heating coils in individual constant volume AHUs and also zone reheat coils. The GSHP system will also have auxiliary electric back-up boilers when the GSHP system is unable to provide 100% heating capacity.
 
According to the ?Performance Compliance for Buildings? document, ?Table 5.4.1.B Reference Case: System AHU2-Multiple Zone? states:
 
1)      If the proposed design is electric heat, then electric resistance heat (see Article 5.4.7.1)

2)      If the proposed design is a heat pump, then see Article 5.4.7.2

3)      If the proposed design is fuel fired and not hydronic, then fuel fired furnace (see Article 5.4.7.3)

4)      If the proposed design is hydronic, then hot water boiler (see Article 5.4.7.2)

 

My initial thought process is that it will be (2), so according to Article 5.4.7.2:
 
?If, for the proposed design, the secondary system is an electric heat pump and none of the heating capacity for auxiliary heating or terminal heating in thermal blocks served by the secondary system is from a source having an energy source adjustment factor (from Appendix D of the code) less than that for ?heat pump?, then the corresponding secondary system for the reference case shall be electric heat pump having a constant COP equal to the reciprocal of the energy source adjustment factor for heat pump?.
 
However ?secondary system? to me implies terminal heat pumps which the proposed design is not. So according to (4) hydronic hot water boiler, Article 5.4.7.2 states:
 
?If, for the proposed design, the secondary system heating or terminal heating in thermal blocks served by the secondary system includes capacity that is hydronic, except in the case of an air-to-air heat pump, then the corresponding secondary system for the reference case shall be hydronic with a fuel fired heating plant with the fuel for the reference system heating plant being the same as the proposed design.
 
So the reference building?s heating plant should be hydronic with electric boilers. Would this be the correct assumption?
 
Thanks in advance for any comments.
 
D?nal

Dear All,

In most of the core and shell projects, the HVAC consultant would have considered diversity factor on the overall cooling tonnage. While modelling, we will be able to comfortably take diversity on occupancy, equipment and lighting loads. But diversity on fresh air cannot be taken. Because of which the project may end up with plant unmet hours. Please let me know how to tackle the issue.

Rathnashree,

1.       Outdoor air minimum (code) amounts generally do not affect unmet load hours very much, so I don?t think you need to be concerned.

2.       The HVAC system may reduce outdoor air amounts if it employs ?demand controlled ventilation?, e.g., CO2 sensors.

Hi Rathnashree,

Yes, it?s not easy for a core-and-shell building. We helped design a core-shell building recently. Here are some points we considered:

-          What kind of tenants do you expect to occupy the space? Offices/Laboratories/Workshops etc?

-          If its offices, you could take the same diversity as occupancy i.e. assuming you are using some kind of demand based ventilation control

-          If its Labs/Workshops you could refer to design guides such as Labs21 or local standards

-          But the best option would be to study metered data of buildings of the same function in your region to understand what an acceptable diversity factor for fresh air could be

Hope this helps. Do let me know if you need further references. Would be glad to help.

Regards, Bharath

?
Well, I guess Rathna's question is the

?'?
conflict
?'?
 between ASHARE 62.1 ventilation calc
? (100% OA systems)?
 and
?OA
 system sizing/design by designer:

for DOA or single zone ventilation calc, diversity factor shall not be
applied. However, taking school
? building?
 as an example, HVAC system
?could be 'downs
ized
?'?
 according to the diversified occupants
?when
 designers believe the total number
? of students and teachers?
 is fixed and they just move from one zone to the other.
?Bear in mind, ?
DCV
/CO2 control?
 is
?the key which is ?
commonly used in order to
?accommodate
 such "diversity"
?
.

?My understanding is that v
entilation calc
? without diversity?
 in this case is actually calculating the maximum OA
? or sum of the diffuser flows?
 for each room
?. From design point of view, two scenarios: 1. ventilation equipment can
be reduced with respect to such diversity factor provided CO2 control is in
the place. or 2. on the other hand, without CO2 control, conflict persists
and equipment sizing has to follow ASHRAE 62.1 calculation.

?Let me know your thoughts.
?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Radiance Official 4.2 Release
Message-ID: <D00FDED3.E9A7%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Following a long alpha/beta period, Radiance 4.2 is official. NREL has created a release tag and binary packages on our git mirror of the Radiance source repository. Some noteworthy items:
* This is the second NREL release based on core RT code revision 4.2.b, and includes new Hessian-based error control in ambient cache.
* gendaymtx has changed to include a header on output, which causes an incompatibility with OpenStudio's Radiance-based daylighting routines. A fix will be included in the next iteration release of OpenStudio.
* This version includes the new rfluxmtx utility,  which should ease the pain of using rcontrib for 3- and 5-phase calculations, as well as a host of other novel applications.

Hi Cheney/Bharath,


Thank you for the reply.

The fresh air is calculated and the system is sized as per ASHRAE 62.1 only.

I will elaborate the issue with an example. If the required cooling capacity after the heat load calculations is 1000 Tr, the diversity of around 80% will be considered for this 1000 Tr. The chillers are sized only for 800 Tr. In the simulation, this diversity considered by the designer will result in plant unmet. I tried reducing the plant unmet by reducing the occupancy, lighting and equipment loads by 20% in the schedules. But the 1000 Tr is calculated including the envelope and fresh air loads also. How to account the diversity from these loads?

Regards,
Rathnashree

Modelica-library AixLib released!
As part of its IEA EBC Annex 60 participation, the Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate, E.ON Energy Research Center, RWTH Aachen University released "AixLib", a Modelica model-library with over 400 items that focuses on building performance simulations. Following the Annex 60 approach, it will be based on common base classes and extend the currently developed Annex 60-library. AixLib is being developed for research and teaching purposes and follows an open-source approach. In this way, it is ready-to-use and supports a native way of getting used to building performance simulation in Modelica. It aims at dynamic simulations of thermal and hydraulic systems to develop control strategies for HVAC systems and analyse interactions in complex systems. AixLib encompasses basic components, models for HVAC systems, models for building physics on different levels of detail and exemplary data sets for all models. It can be applied on component, building and city district level. It is freely available under Modelica License 2 and can be downloaded at https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib. We welcome you to take part in this development and to raise issues using github.
Contact: aixlib at eonerc.rwth-aachen.de<mailto:aixlib at eonerc.rwth-aachen.de>

Dear all, here are my comments and suggestions.
I use the following to determine a diversity in a building. From the simulation model the number of occupants based on say one person per 10m2 ( one per 100sf) is 800. Then look at the fire Marshall report for the number of people allowed in the building, also look at the elevator calculations to see on how many occupants the elevators have been calculated to and lastly if there is a cafeteria or canteen see how many people have been used in the calculations?
For simplicity let's say the fire rating is 600 occupants then the simple diversity is 600/800 =75%

Hi Rathnashree,

Yes, it?s not easy for a core-and-shell building. We helped design a core-shell building recently. Here are some points we considered:
-          What kind of tenants do you expect to occupy the space? Offices/Laboratories/Workshops etc?
-          If its offices, you could take the same diversity as occupancy i.e. assuming you are using some kind of demand based ventilation control
-          If its Labs/Workshops you could refer to design guides such as Labs21 or local standards
-          But the best option would be to study metered data of buildings of the same function in your region to understand what an acceptable diversity factor for fresh air could be

Hope this helps. Do let me know if you need further references. Would be glad to help.

Dear All,

In most of the core and shell projects, the HVAC consultant would have considered diversity factor on the overall cooling tonnage. While modelling, we will be able to comfortably take diversity on occupancy, equipment and lighting loads. But diversity on fresh air cannot be taken. Because of which the project may end up with plant unmet hours. Please let me know how to tackle the issue.

Rathnashree

Hi Rathna,



1. Load calculation usually takes the worst-case scenario. For cooling
peaks, all the internal loads, envelope and solar heat will be covered at
design temperature difference. In the real world, it is rare such worst
case will be predominant and it is not necessary to fine-tune every each
inputs of your annual energy model.



2.  My understanding, as I mentioned in my last email, is that occupancy
diversity usually links with ventilation load and equipment rather than the
heat/cooling plant. Such diversity ?should compromise on building
envelope, etc. If the plant cannot handle envelope lost/gain, it is not
properly sized, period.



3. It is a common approach that a safety factor, say 15%, will be added
above the load calculation result for sizing the final cooling plant.
Unless I misunderstand your case, 80% downsizing the whole cooling plant
sounds abnormal to me especially nowadays load calculation software, such
as TRACE, has already considered block load and come up with a fairly
accurate results. ?


?Regards, ?

Dear all, here are my comments and suggestions.
I use the following to determine a diversity in a building. From the simulation model the number of occupants based on say one person per 10m2 ( one per 100sf) is 800. Then look at the fire Marshall report for the number of people allowed in the building, also look at the elevator calculations to see on how many occupants the elevators have been calculated to and lastly if there is a cafeteria or canteen see how many people have been used in the calculations?
For simplicity let's say the fire rating is 600 occupants then the simple diversity is 600/800 =75%

Hi Cheney/Bharath,

Thank you for the reply.

The fresh air is calculated and the system is sized as per ASHRAE 62.1 only.

I will elaborate the issue with an example. If the required cooling capacity after the heat load calculations is 1000 Tr, the diversity of around 80% will be considered for this 1000 Tr. The chillers are sized only for 800 Tr. In the simulation, this diversity considered by the designer will result in plant unmet. I tried reducing the plant unmet by reducing the occupancy, lighting and equipment loads by 20% in the schedules. But the 1000 Tr is calculated including the envelope and fresh air loads also. How to account the diversity from these loads?

Rathnashree

Dear Bharath,

If you looking for whole building simulations (not just windows) then both ESP-r and EnergyPlus (and their associated interfaces) could model thermochromic glazing. It may not be fully straightforward in some cases to get the inputs that you need but it is possible.

I will email you privately later on of a conference paper that demonstrates the modelling of thermochromic windows with ESP-r.

Best regards,
Georgios

Descriptions


*Ladybug + Honeybee*



Ladybug and Honeybee are open source environmental plugins for Grasshopper
that help architects and engineers create an environmentally-conscious
architectural design.



Ladybug imports standard EnergyPlus Weather files (.EPW) into Grasshopper
and provides a variety of 3D interactive graphics to support the
decision-making process during the initial stages of design. The plugin
also provides further support for designers as they test their initial
design options with radiation, sunlight-hour, and shading analyses.
Integration with Grasshopper allows for an almost instantaneous feedback
and, since the plugin runs within the design environment, the information
and analyses are interactive.



Honeybee connects Grasshopper3D to EnergyPlus, Radiance, Daysim and
OpenStudio for building energy and daylighting simulation.  The Honeybee
project intends to make many of the features of these simulation tools
available in a parametric way.  Just as users have made changes to geometry
for years in Grasshopper, now users can parameterize system types, zoning
schemes, schedules of operation, daylight sensor placement and controls -
 all of the ?hardcore? simulation parameters that have never been exposed
to parametric modeling tools.

COP of chiller is 1/EIR (Energy Input ratio) in eQuest/DOE-2. There is a curve in the program that relates theses parameters.

I don't know to which program you're referring, but all of them should have performance 
curves that adjust the nominal performance of the chiller based on the air or water 
temperatures, and part-load-ratio.

In DOE-2,  for example, a hermetic centrifugal chiller has a bi-quadratic curve 
(HERM-CENT-EIR-FT) with 6 coefficients that modifies the EIR as a function of the entering 
condenser water temperature (TIN) and the leaving chilled water temperature (TOUT).  There 
are default coefficients, or if you have more specific data from the manufacturer, you can 
also derive your custom coefficients.

In EnergyPlus, the chillers are modeled the same way, and in fact I recall that at least 
one of them was copied from DOE-2.

Pure theory the chiller is a Rankine cycle and there is a formula to derive the cycle from the evaporating and condensing temperature of the chiller then you multiply the Rankine cycle by the efficiency of the motor driving the compressor and get COP.
Jim and Joe are correct that the simulation program does this for you ( in most cases), however if you want to design your own chiller I would suggest the cool tool program that Mark Hydeman derived many years ago which I believe can de downloaded from the Taylor Engineering website.

FYI:

The bi-quadradic equations in DOE-2, EQUEST, and Energyplus are good if you have real data to "tune" them. These are what Hydeman's toolkit are based on. Otherwise, the work by Jeff Gordon and K. Ng on semi-empirical chiller models is helpful, and has lumped thermodynamic properties. ASHRAE RP 827 is also helpful for in-situ situations.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Chiller COP

Pure theory the chiller is a Rankine cycle and there is a formula to derive the cycle from the evaporating and condensing temperature of the chiller then you multiply the Rankine cycle by the efficiency of the motor driving the compressor and get COP.
Jim and Joe are correct that the simulation program does this for you ( in most cases), however if you want to design your own chiller I would suggest the cool tool program that Mark Hydeman derived many years ago which I believe can de downloaded from the Taylor Engineering website.

Message-ID: <fe670e932984436ea6a0abd7fb5f867e@DM2PR04MB560.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Just a reminder for this week's BSUG 2.0 presentation, see details below.

>From BIM to Sim - How do you get all that rich data into simulations without re-entering?

Date and Time: Wednesday August 27th, 2014 - 12.00 to 13.00 MT
Location: UI - IDL Classroom - 306 S 6th St. Boise, ID
Remote Webinar Available: Register HERE<https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/2209821919421985794> for the remote webinar

Description:
BSUG on August 27th will feature Dru Crawley, will be discussing capturing rich data from Building Information Modeling (BIM) for simulation. BIM is one of the most powerful tools that designers have to create and visualize 3-D building models. BIM allows the designer to track thousands of building components in 3-D and thus detect potential interferences. It also makes it easy to visually display a potentially complex design in a way that building owners can easily understand. Similarly, building energy simulation (SIM) has evolved into a powerful tool for evaluating the energy performance of potential or existing buildings. Building simulation allows easy comparison of the energy and environmental performance of many hundreds of design or retrofit options. Because much of the data that building simulation tools require already exists in the BIM models, it's critical that simple methods for sharing that data are available. This presentation describes the opportunities and challenges for sharing data between BIM and SIM and recent advances in data exchange. This will be followed by a demonstration of creating energy models from various sources - 3-D, 2-D, and images - using Bentley's AECOsim Energy Simulator.

I am wondering how much success people have had with Retail Core & Shell projects in terms of EAp2/EAc1.  It seems to me that the typical large mall (250,000 ft2 or larger) with roof top units presents little opportunity for energy savings.  I would appreciate some of your experiences.

Thanks!

Christopher,
There might also be savings associated with the food service areas. Heat recovery off of the walk-in refrigeration that pre-heats the domestic hot water and energy star commercial kitchen appliances are perhaps applicable.

Depending on the climate and definitely dependent on the architecture, a transpired solar wall might be applicable for pre-heating ventilation air. Again, depending on the climate, can you naturally ventilate the circulation areas or do a mechanical assisted hybrid-system that pulls in outside air to the circulation spaces.

Best,
Shanta

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] LEED 2009 and Retail Core & Shell EAp2/EAc1

A few ideas off the top of my head....

Most Rooftop Unit manufacturers offer high-efficiency (> 90.1 min) units with energy recovery wheels and economizers with demand controlled ventilation. Malls are excellent candidates for DCV with variable occupancy levels. In addition you could go with a cool roof (depending if you are in north or south), skylights with daylight controls on common (atrium/corridor) areas as well as possibly on 2nd floor retail space. It's a bit challenging to use daylight with some retail as they often have specific color rendering values they must have to property illuminate merchandise.

Beef-up the roof and wall insulation well above 90.1 levels and use low-e skylights with high VLT as well as LED lighting. Recover condensate for watering any landscaping as well as possible rainwater harvesting on roof to use in toilets and landscaping. Large roof surface also excellent location for PV solar. If you have a parking garage that is enclosed (not naturally ventilated) consider using variable-speed exhaust fans tied to CO sensors to track auto traffic.

Many more options than you may think once you start digging into it.

Hi Christopher,

Other than energy recovery on the ventilation and 
using extended schedule I agree with you there is 
little option.  And that is simulation 
saving.  If there is demand ventilaiton installed 
on site the energy for heating the ventilaiton 
air is reduce a lot, more than what simulation gives us.

We did a lot of these CS big box retail and never 
went over 34% energy cost saving compare to MNECB 
and 32% compared to ASHRAE 90.1

DesignBuilder Software has released version 4 of its popular whole building
energy simulation program ?DesignBuilder?. Version 4 adds a substantial set
of new features and improvements oriented to the different but overlapping
needs of architects and engineers. 

Santa Rosa, California August 25, 2014 - DesignBuilder Software has released
version 4 of its popular whole building energy simulation program
?DesignBuilder?. Version 4 adds a substantial set of new features and
improvements oriented to the different but overlapping needs of architects
and engineers.

DesignBuilder Packages for Architects ensure that designs meet performance
targets at the early design stages by providing accurate and reliable energy
and daylighting performance data. The Architectural simulation packages
allow architects to link with BIM (Building Information Modeling) solutions,
analyze solar shading, maximize the use of renewable technologies and test
fa?ade options in one comprehensive software program.

DesignBuilder Packages for Engineers consists of an integrated set of
high-productivity tools to assist with the integration of mechanical systems
within sustainable buildings design. Various design scenarios for HVAC
systems and controls, facades, lighting, and renewable technologies can be
evaluated with relative ease. Using drag and drop air and water components,
HVAC systems can be constructed within DesignBuilder from scratch.
Additionally, pre-defined HVAC templates, autosizing and zone grouping
features save significant input time compared to competing products. The
most commonly used EnergyPlus HVAC system types are readily available
including all ten ASHRAE 90.1 baseline HVAC systems.

New features available as modules in release version 4 include: 

*	ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G compatibility - ASHRAE 90.1 for 2007 and 2010
including constructions, materials, glazing systems, activities, lighting
and HVAC systems for both LEED certification and IRS tax credits.
*	Optimization - helps identify design options with the very best
combinations of cost, energy and comfort performance.
*	Cost - calculate the economic impact various building designs using
construction cost, utility tariffs and life-cycle analysis.

All DesignBuilder packages provide sensitivity analyses at the click of a
button. High quality technical and rendered outputs help communicate
findings to clients in a way they can easily understand. Key performance
indicators such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, thermal comfort,
daylight availability and cost can be provided throughout the design process
in both naturally ventilated and air-conditioned buildings.

When speaking at the V4 launch in July, Dr. Andy Tindale, founder and CEO of
DesignBuilder, explained ?The new functionality provided by version 4 really
is a step-change in DesignBuilder?s energy and comfort modelling
capabilities. Some major improvements to the modeller further enhance our
existing strengths in the ability to create and edit geometry quickly and
easily. The improved BIM import; enhanced LEED and ASHRAE 90.1 capability;
new HVAC systems such as ground source heat pumps; tariff analysis;
Simulation Manager for running parallel simulations; and, Optimisation for
multi-objective cost benefit analysis have helped to strengthen our position
as the leading interface to EnergyPlus.?

Company Profile

DesignBuilder Software Ltd specializes in developing high-quality,
easy-to-use and affordable simulation software tools for assessing the
environmental performance of building designs. The flagship product
DesignBuilder provides data to building designers on energy consumption,
carbon emissions, occupant comfort, daylight availability as well as the
status of the building with regard to several national building regulations
and certification standards. Leading services engineers and energy modelers
across the world use DesignBuilder to gain an insight into the impact of
their design strategies on building environmental performance. The software
is the result of considerable investment in user interface technology and an
uncompromising approach to software design.

The DesignBuilder software is distributed throughout the world by a network

Chris,

I don't have much experience with packaged rooftop retail but you can check out ?ASHRAE's 50% Advanced Energy Design Guide for Medium to Big Box stores. ?It has recommendations for LPD, lighting controls, plug load controls, exterior lighting, HVAC, etc. ?So yes, you probably can't get there with a HE rooftop and roof/wall insulation - lots of other strategies are probably required. ?As yours is c+S, you'll want to have mandatory tenant requirements written into the lease too. ?

Also, since it was published most of the major manufacturers have ?released some slick single zone VAV rooftop units with VS compressors and ECM motors on evaporator and condenser fans.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Precipitation value in stat extension file.
Message-ID: <CAJdG7BBE6_SZUCUn4BKEnLeTou3oBUzwmUacG8xr1AB3NAJugA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I am doing some analysis on weather file in which I need precipitation
value in mm or  inches. However, when I look on stat extension file, there
is monthly precipitation value in kPa. As I know 'kPa' is a unit of
pressure. Please let me know if anyone has  conversion factor for monthly
precipitation value from kPa to mm(inches).

The epw extension file has hourly precipitation value in mm. However, all
the weather files do not have hourly precipitation values.

I'll be grateful if anyone can guide me on this. :)

Regards,

Mayank

Mayank,

You're right.  kPa is a unit of pressure, so somehow the header units you're using have 
been misaligned.  I won't comment on what you see in the EPW, but if you look at the 
source weather file, which probably uses a TMY3 or TMY2/IWEC format (the only ones I know 
that contain precipitation data), there are two columns for liquid precipitation, one for 
depth in mm followed by one for duration in hr.

Having said that, from my investigations in creating the IWEC2 weather files I've 
concluded that this way of reporting the liquid precipitation can lead to missing or 
double counting the amount of precipitation. The reason is that in the actual weather 
station reports, there may be multiple reports in one record, e.g.,
    100mm over the past 1 hour and 500mm over the past 24 hours
as well as reports that overlap in time, e.g.,
    200mm over the past 4 hours
followed several hours later by
    400mm over the past 24 hours

I've attached the brief-up about liquid precipitation from the IWEC2 final report with 
more details.

The other thing to consider is that if you're using a "typical year" weather file, the 
liquid precipitation on that file are a random selection and may not represent long-range 
averages.  Depending on your level of interest, it's best to go back to the source 
historical weather files such as those available at NCDC:  www.ncdc.noaa/oa/climate/isd/

That said, I would echo Joe's comments about using this information with 
caution.  Some data sources do not contain actual precip amounts but 
only a flag for raining or not raining.  The weather processor will fill 
in approximate precip amounts in that case.

The variable in kPa is probably showing the total column water vapor. kPa water vapor divided by atmospheric pressure (101.3 kPa or thereabouts at sea level) would be an aggregate measure of absolute humidity i.e. an average over the vertical profile at some specific location.

Not sure what it is subsequently used for in E+?

Mayank,

You're right.  kPa is a unit of pressure, so somehow the header units you're using have been misaligned.  I won't comment on what you see in the EPW, but if you look at the source weather file, which probably uses a TMY3 or TMY2/IWEC format (the only ones I know that contain precipitation data), there are two columns for liquid precipitation, one for depth in mm followed by one for duration in hr.

Having said that, from my investigations in creating the IWEC2 weather files I've concluded that this way of reporting the liquid precipitation can lead to missing or double counting the amount of precipitation. The reason is that in the actual weather station reports, there may be multiple reports in one record, e.g.,
   100mm over the past 1 hour and 500mm over the past 24 hours
as well as reports that overlap in time, e.g.,
   200mm over the past 4 hours
followed several hours later by
   400mm over the past 24 hours

I've attached the brief-up about liquid precipitation from the IWEC2 final report with more details.

The other thing to consider is that if you're using a "typical year" weather file, the liquid precipitation on that file are a random selection and may not represent long-range averages.  Depending on your level of interest, it's best to go back to the source historical weather files such as those available at NCDC:  www.ncdc.noaa/oa/climate/isd/<http://www.ncdc.noaa/oa/climate/isd/>

The epw extension file has hourly precipitation value in mm. However, all the weather files do not have hourly precipitation values.

Sounds liked you're referring to Precipitable Water, which has no relationship to the actual liquid precipitation falling on the ground. PW is reported in the TMY2/3 weather files, mainly because it's used along with a few other arcane variables (aerosol optical depth, albedo) in modeling solar radiation. These are all echoed in the EPW, which content-wise is 99% identical to the TMY2/3s, but I can't think of any reason why any of these variables would be used in EnergyPlus.

Another reason I'm doubtful of your explanation is that PW is typically reported in depth (0.1 cm in the TMYs) and not pressure.

Dear Colleagues

 

The Toronto Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), in association with the
Canadian Passive House Institute, is hosting a one-day, introductory course
on Passive House Design.  

 

This course will explore how the Passive House Standard can be a
cost-effective way to design and construct a building that is extremely
energy efficient. Attendees will leave the course with a fundamental
understanding of the elements of Passive House Design. Participants will
also have an opportunity to explore the business case for designing and
building to the Passive House Standard, including total costs and long-term
energy savings. Following this course participants will have an overview of
the key principles and concept of the Passive House Standard. Participants
will be able to generally differentiate sustainable constructions from
others and will be able to analyze projects more in depth. This course will
help participants to design and build sustainable projects.

 

This course benefits builders, designers, policy makers and professionals
involved in sustainability or energy efficiency in the built environment

Mayank,

It would help if I knew the extent and purpose of your investigation into 
precipitation/rainfall data.  For example, what are the location(s)?  Is it related to 
assessing building energy performance, like for a green roof, etc.   Is it a hypothetical 
study for average conditions or a specific study of an actual building, time, and place ?

If you want typical internal gains (though not schedules), check out Table 303.4 (and more for the U.S.) in this RESNET Standard: http://www.resnet.us/standards/RESNET_Mortgage_Industry_National_HERS_Standards.pdf.
