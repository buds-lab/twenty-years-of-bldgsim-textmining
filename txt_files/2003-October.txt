The Canadian equivalent to TMY2 are called CWEC
(Canadian Weather for Energy Calculations) and are
in WYEC2 format.  Hourly files for 55 locations are
available.  They are available from
National Climate Data and Information Archive
at Environment Canada (roughly www.ec.gc.ca).

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200310301029.AA2923296pd80000457522@gard.com>


Meteonorm 5.0 is fairly user friendly and does write hourly
data in TMY2 format (among a lot of other formats).

However, most hourly data is statistically derived extrapolations
from daily or even monthly data--and the period of record can
be as short as 5 years in some cases.  In cases of large changes
in elevation among stations, we've  and it can do some strange
things with elevation changes among stations.

Our experience has shown that it is usable BUT.. only if you have
no recorded data and if before using, you carefully compare it
to published normals for the location such as:

World locations (1961-1990 period of record):

Hi,

I hoping to draw on your experience. Meteonorm version 5.0 seems to provide
weather data for any location in the world as per their website. Their
website, however, does not give much more information, or sample data, or
GUI views.

Do any of the list members have experience with it? Does it provide hourly
data in TMY2 format (or data that can be converted into TMY2 format)? Is
the
data current and reliable? And how user friendly (and bug-free) is it?
Please advise.

Thanks.

natural ventilation analysis toolsTo add to Jon Hand's comments.  

I have used Apache (IES) successfully for the assessment / design of natural ventilation systems.  While I am not an expert with TAS, it appears to offer very similar functionality to IES based on my limited experience with it.  Both offer multi-zone bulk airflow modelling combined with the dynamic thermal simulation.  CFD is typically used to gain a greater insight into local air temperatures and airflow at one point in time where bulk airflow provides a zone average otherwise.  Increasingly some consultants are using CFD for transient simulations.  The Swiss Reinsurance building in London (The Ghurkin) I believe was designed using CFD exclusively by Hilson-Moran.  While some CFD packages are now claiming to account for the transient radiant loads, I am doubtful whether this would provide as useful of a tool as bulk airflow modelling - this will change ...

In terms of useful and correct results, there has been BESTesting and some validation of these tools from real buildings.  In my experience you need to be very careful to declare results in absolute terms.  There are so many variables beyond our control and the biggest one, the weather, drives when natural ventilation systems are useful.  A sensitivity study of key variables to understand the risks and thus where better information and additional design is needed to be confident, is essential.

Those interested in natural ventilation and mixed mode ventilation
might wish to check <http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk> for details
about ESP-r. It has long offered integrated thermal and CFD analysis,
integrated thermal and mass flow (bulk) analysis as well as
(more recently) the possibility to integrate thermal CFD and mass flow
assessments. It is open source so you can check out
the underlying numerical processes and add in your
own home-cooked wall functions or mass flow components.

Natural and nixed mode ventilation has been of long-standing
interest in Europe and ESP-r is regularly used for such
assessments. We know of quite a few practitioners who
also use TAS. 

Most often engineering questions of natural 
ventilation problems can be addressed via integrated mass
flow and thermal assessments (there is minimal overhead
in solving thousands of timesteps). There is still an
art in configuring a flow network and there are gaps
in the available components (e.g. single sided ventilation
is a challenge) but practitioners are using simulation to
address this routinely. 

When questions of mean age of air and local discomfort arise, CFD
may be appropriate (for somewhat fewer timesteps). There
is also much of an art to CFD use so some preparation is 
required prior to real-time deployment.  

CIBSE has issued a Mixed mode ventilation applications
manual (CIBSE AM13:2000) which covers various
methods of evaluation, procedures for professional practice
and information sources. It discusses in detail how one
might deal with uncertainty in flow rates as well as 
fall-back systems for extreme conditions. A definite must-read!

Brian,
 
as far as I know does TAS use transfer-functions for the energy transport
through components like walls and glazings; thus the internal surface
temperatures of glazings arenot modelled in a correct way. As these internal
surface temperatures are dominating the vertical near surface air flow (the
development of boundary layers), a more reliable simulation tool should be
used. I am using ESP-r from ESRU, Joe Clark, which is based on
1-D-heatconduction modelled via finite differences algorithm; thus the
absorption of solar radiation within the single panes can be calculated as
well as the resulting heat fluxes to external and internal surfaces. This
yield more correct internal surface temperatures.
 
But you have asked for detailled CFD-studies about natural ventilation: This
is currently a challenging task !
 
The basic problem is that the well known high resolving CFD simulation tools
like CFX-5 or Fluent are not able to simulate a longer period of time (due
to the high resolution this would require a huge amount of computer power),
i.e. currently simulation time is maximal a complete day; on the other hand
the storage of heat in building's mass (floors, walls, ceilings, etc.) shows
a strong effect onto the temperatures, but to get a stable solution it will
take a longer period of time (simulation time of at least 14 days ore more,
depending on the amount of storage mass). This is the reason, why you have
to use a zonal based simulation tool - like ESP-r - for the starting period
of the simulation (i.e. the first 2..3 weeks) and then you have to couple it
with a CFD simulation tool. This coupling can be done either via internal
surface temperatures (as boundary conditions for the CFD simulation) or -
even more better - with wall heat fluxes (which provides a temperature
distribution on the internal surfaces).
Currently ESP-r has the facility to couple the zonal based simulation with
an internal CFD-capability; but there are restrictions due to the number of
windows (only two openings are allowed); also the analyses of the
CFD-results shows some problems. 
These were the reasons why we coupled ESP-r with the well known
CFD-simulation tool CFX-5; we used the output from ESP-r (wall heat fluxes
and surface absorptions, air flow rates towards outside (ambient air)
calculated via an air-flow-network model) as input values for the CFD-model
and we got some nice results. If you are interested in I could send you some
examples.
 
Hope these informations help you. If you have further questions, don?t
hesitate to contact me.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] natural ventilation analysis tools



Does anyone have experience with CFD, and non-CFD analysis tools for design
and energy analysis of natural ventilation? 

Tas is one I have heard a lot about lately. 

Can anyone describe their experience in learning, using, providing usable
and correct results, and extrapolating results to annual energy
usage/savings?

Any other software that provides at least some 2-D or 3-D CFD, and hourly
thermal calculations for natural ventilation? 

Thanks,

Jeff

We received the introductory manuals from the Solar Energy Lab at
UW-Madison and we are interested in TRNSYS.  I am copying this reply to
BLDG-SIM also in answer to your question about cooling device.  We are
considering shell and tube heat exchangers (using chilled water from the
refrigeration plant) located downstream of the secondary storage tanks
and sized to meet design demand.  We will be contacting you soon
regarding the use of TRNSYS.

Yes, TRNSYS has the capability to model the piping/tank system you are 
studying.  However, you did not mention the devices that will be used to

cool the water supply (air or water-cooled chillers, water-water heat 
pumps, etc..).  Assuming that the cooling system is relatively standard 
then the answer is still YES (there are models for most standard HVAC 
equipment components in TRNSYS) .  If the cooling system is something on

the unusual side then I would still stick with TRNSYS as it has the 
capability to quickly and easily add content (new component models) to
the 
package.  There are also large libraries of user-written component
models 
available (both free and for a small fee) that greatly expand the 
capabilities of the program beyond that available through the standard
package.

Feel free to send me an e-mail if you have further, or more-detailed, 
questions on TRNSYS.

Apparently this didn't get through before, so I'm
resending it with the spreadsheet zipped, and the
original message below:


I believe that you need to request the various input
and capacity data holding two of the three parameters
(CHWT, CDWT, %load) constant, and varying the third.
Which is a lot of points for the manufacturer, but
they can do it. For recips this info is often
available in the catalog. However, once you've got the
data, its fairly difficult to turn it into DOE2
curves, as the curves need to be interpolated between
each other. ie. you'll get a capacity vs CDWT curve
for CHWT of 42,44,46,48, etc, but they're not exactly
the same. The easy way out is just to use the 44? one,
but its not as accurate. You don't have to do this
with PLR though.

I've attached a spreadsheet that does some
interpolation and calculation of curve co-efficients
if anyone wants to try it. It might need to be
adjusted for the data available though.

Thank you to all who replied on my request for ideas on conceptual modeling
of central plant for large campus in early phases.  Sorry for not  listing
source on all of these items in summary. Most went to whole distribution in
their orginal form with credit to commenter. Sorry if I missed anyone.

To summarize:

eQuest--Use DD Wizard, and create each building as a shell with area, shape
and occupancy inputs only for shell, rest as defaults. Plant can be defined
to serve each building. This is probably what I will use. 

eQuest--use SD Wizard for multiple buildings and import them together.

Trane System Analyzer, and Trace

DOE2.1e input simple building inputs in text mode.

VisualPlant Doe21e with building load profiles instead of separate load
inputs for each building.  Promising but I would have to buy new software.

And a technical paper
Beasley, R., Haberl, J., Turner, D. and Claridge, D. 2002. "Development of a
Methodology for Baselining The Energy Use of Large Multi-building Central
Plants", ASHRAE Transactions-Research,  Volume 108, Part 1, pp. 251 - 259,

I am currently working on developing prototype building simulation models for "HUD-Code" mobile/manufactured homes, specifically for use in assessing the impact of energy-efficiency measures for units located in California.  As such, I am looking for any and all related information that would be useful in developing those prototypes and energy-efficiency measures.
 
I already have several excellent reference sources and examples, but in order to leave no stone unturned in my search for previous and concurrent work, I am throwing this out to the group.  Thanks in advance for your assistance!
 
Sincerely,
 
Bob Ramirez

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200310171325.AA2551750pd80000442065@gard.com>

We have a situation where we have to model a CW piping system to
determine the additional cooling, heating and energy requirements.  In
Dubai the city water supply comes from a desalination plant and has to
be cooled to acceptable temperatures before it reaches the cold water
faucets.  The city water supply temperature varies through the year. The
water enters a concrete tank and is pumped to secondary tanks at
different levels and then supplied to the faucets.  This is a high-rise
building with retail, restaurant, hotel, office and apartment floors. We
would like to know the design cooling load, a year-round temperature
profile of the water at various points in the piping and tank system and
the annual cooling energy required.  We have the Dubai weather data from
NCDC which we have converted for use with DOE2.1E.  We also have the
water demand and usage profiles for the different levels.  We have
already done a preliminary analysis but would like to check the results
with an established program designed for this purpose.  Can TRNSYS model
this?

Regarding the recent discussion on a suitable energy program to model
several university campus buildings that are being developed in phases,
we have a similar project here and I had no problem using the DOE2.1E
BDL.  I think there are several advantages in using a text input format
for very large projects instead of filling out forms or trying to draw
all the buildings as input.  Trying to import architectural drawings as
input for such projects is not practical.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Major disagreement on Chiller Performance Curves in DOE-2.1E and DOE-2.2
In-Reply-To: <BC503DD06F99424E9DC941ED1D0F8329E15A50@MAIL-06VS.atlarge.net>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200310161740.AA4056843pd80000441156@gard.com>

DOE 2.2 has a built in feature that allows you to enter raw data points and
create various types of performance curves.  I cannot comment on how it
works though, we have our own proprietary spreadsheet that we use to solve
for the coefficients.

My experience is the more points you use the less reliable the curve becomes
especially in the extreme areas of the curve (using a bi-quadratic).  I find
that I get better results creating a curve that is "tailored" to how a
chiller is going to operate using fewer points.  For example if I know the
chiller is going to be supplying 42-44F water I don't bother creating a
curve using 40-41F or 46-48F data.  

Although I have never done it I'm sure you could create a user expression to
dynamically change the chiller curves (ie. one set for 40-44 CHWT and one
for 44 - 48 CHWT) while the program is running (ie. based on a change in
CHWT or CWT).

I would be curious to hear if anyone has ever tried that.

I believe that you need to request the various input
and capacity data holding two of the three parameters
(CHWT, CDWT, %load) constant, and varying the third.
Which is a lot of points for the manufacturer, but
they can do it. For recips this info is often
available in the catalog. However, once you've got the
data, its fairly difficult to turn it into DOE2
curves, as the curves need to be interpolated between
each other. ie. you'll get a capacity vs CDWT curve
for CHWT of 42,44,46,48, etc, but they're not exactly
the same. The easy way out is just to use the 44? one,
but its not as accurate. You don't have to do this
with PLR though.

I've attached a spreadsheet that does some
interpolation and calculation of curve co-efficients
if anyone wants to try it. It might need to be
adjusted for the data available though.

Alec,

If you are using EnergyPlus, you can create a 3D building model in
ArchiCAD and save it in IFC2x format.  Then you can import the IFC file
into EnergyPlus via the BS Pro server and client (both bundled with
EnergyPlus) and automatically create IDF for building geometry.  Once
you have the building model in  ArchiCAD, the whole process takes only a
few minutes, depending on the size and complexity of the building.

If the building model was created in ADT 2004, you can get an IFC2x
interface for ADT 2004 (it is not bundled with EnergyPlus) and create an
IFC file that way.  Building models created with ADT 3.3 may or may not
result in valid IFC2x files.

If the source of building geometry is in 2D *.dwg or *.dxf files, you
can create 3D building models from them by using Graphisoft's Plan2Model
software; the resulting 3D building model will be an ArchiCAD model.
That is a lot easier and faster than generating a 3D model by hand.

If you have a building that has *only* rectangular walls and can be
properly extruded vertically from floor plans into 2.5D, you can use
Visio 2002 Professional to create a quasi-3D building model from 2D
floor plans and save it in IFC 2.0 format.  That file can then be read
by BS Pro server and client, etc.

If the building model was created with SketchUp, you can get the
interface with which you can import the model into ArchiCAD, save it as
an IFC file, run BS Pro server and client, and generate the geometry in
IDF format.

Using *any* of these scripts will save you a lot of time and grief in
generating building geometry input for EnergyPlus runs.  ArchiCAD 7 will
save you even more time: It has a tool that allows you to group
architectural spaces into thermal zones by simply dragging and dropping
space names into zones you create in the object tree - there is no need
to redraw anything.  That feature is not working properly in the latest
version of ArchiCAD (8.3) yet, but is expected to work shortly.

A 3D building model, based on the IFC data model, provides you also with
opportunities to exchange data other than building geometry data with
many other apps.  This includes the exchange of HVAC definitions
(equipment, components, systems), definitions of ducts and pipes,
electrical definitions (equipment, components and systems), detailed
cost data for estimates on the fly, structural definitions, data on
building use (facilities management) and operation, and more.

Currently posted most up-to-date eQUEST is version 3.37  ... many new features
in all areas, including wizards, with added material in the tutorial (version 3.25)
to explain simple use.  Program, documentation, weather files and training materials
are all freeware found at http://doe2.com/equest/ and this new version will soon be at 
http://www.energydesignresources.com/

For AutoCAD import and trace around (or just manually created floor plans,
spaces, or surfaces) the maximum number of vertices in 120.  This version
also allows up to 4000 spaces and 8000 each for exterior walls, windows and
2000 air-side HVAC systems.  A 1440 space run (with 792 exterior walls and 372
windows, 672 ground coupled surfaces, 4080 interior walls, 648 building shades, 720 air-side
AHU's) runs through BDL in 90 seconds and completes a year simulation, including
detail output reports, in just under 51 minutes on a Dell PWS450 (2.66GHz IX
processor and 1GB RAM) running Windows XP-Pro.  This model (a 14 building campus)
was created with the new muti-shell, muti-HVAC Design Development wizard in 
less than an hour; of course the use of custom footprints and adjustments to space and
HVAC details (needed to represent a final design) will add substantial information collection
and eQUEST input time.

In the interface there are many new wizard capabilities (in both model creation wizards and the EEM wizard)
to allow you to get much closer to the final model before making your transition into the detail
interface mode.  Many new graphics reports were added, including muti-run comparison graphics and input
summary reporting on the HVAC side (includes specified and calculated HVAC sizing parameters.)

In addition to interface additions, some of the Version 41 and 42 DOE-2.2 changes include
(see the six volume manual set posted in the download area):

Space modeling enhancement:
Ice-Skating Rinks (including hourly calculated radiative, convective, resurfacing, skater, and sub-floor heating loads)

Electric Generation Enhancement:
Photovoltaic Systems (including arrays, inverters and mounting/shading hourly modeling)

Chiller additions including: 
Air-Source Chiller/Heat-Pumps
Water-Source Chiller/Heat Pumps
Loop-to-Loop Chiller/Heat Pumps
Screw Chillers
Variable-Speed Centrifugals
Air-Cooled, Evaporatively-Cooled , and Remote condensers
Condenser models allowing both off-rated and variable flow
Independent specification of chiller rated vs. design conditions
(includes new CURVE-FIT TYPE of BI-QUADRATIC-RATIO&dT)

Air-side HVAC enhancements:
Staged-Volume, Packaged Single-Zone AHU model
Enhanced Economizer Controls
Air-to-Air Energy-Recovery Ventilators
AHU now has SIZING-METHOD specified as FLOW/CAPACITY (cfm/ton) or CAPACITY/FLOW (tons/cfm) to allow coupling between flow and capacity sizing
Return Duct Infiltration

We invite you to download, examine and use this freeware package and hope it
helps you deliver superior services to your customers in a more cost effective manner.

  I used eQuest v2.55 to model a fairly complex floorplan (32 vertices) with success.  As John Aulbach indicated, this is accomplished by referencing a scaled AutoCAD drawing and then effectively tracing over it with polygons.  The interface is not difficult.  You can also create unique floorplans independently and then merge them into one model.  The challenge is getting the HVAC zones to recognize which walls are exterior versus interior partitions.  In the end, you will likely need to input each vertex manually to get this to work.  Later versions of the software (I believe they are up to v3.24) may have enhancements to this, such as referencing elevations to input window configurations.

Alec, et al.,
Actually there's been lots of progress in this area. GeoPraxis and three
major 3D-CAD software vendors recently announced that they are actively
working to develop Green Building XML (gbXML) connectors to the following
tools:

 - Autodesk? Architectural Desktop
 - Autodesk? Revit?
 - Graphisoft?s ArchiCAD?
 - Bentley Architecture?

The free Green Building Studio web service, scheduled for launch early next
year, will read the gbXML files produced by these programs and AUTOMATE all
the steps required to produce a complete energy simulation analysis. (See
other posting to this thread describing manually assisted CAD file
translation practices using currently available tools).

For more background, including several quotes from CAD industry executives,
check out a recent press release:

I used eQuest v2.55 to model a fairly complex floorplan (32 vertices) with
success.  As John Aulbach indicated, this is accomplished by referencing a
scaled AutoCAD drawing and then effectively tracing over it with polygons.
The interface is not difficult.  You can also create unique floorplans
independently and then merge them into one model.  The challenge is getting
the HVAC zones to recognize which walls are exterior versus interior
partitions.  In the end, you will likely need to input each vertex manually
to get this to work.  Later versions of the software (I believe they are up
to v3.24) may have enhancements to this, such as referencing elevations to
input window configurations.

eQUEST is the best that I am aware of.  You can import an AutoCAD drawing
and trace it using the mouse.  It is far from perfect and only works in 2-D
(floorplans), but I have used it successfully on some fairly complicated
buildings.  It's a whole lot better than doing it manually.

eQUEST expanded allowable vertices to 120 in version 3-35, but there was a
problem with the DOE-2.2 calculation engine and lots of vertices.  There is
a version 3-37 on the download site dated yesterday.  Hopefully, the
vertices problem is fixed.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Major disagreement on Chiller Performance Curves in DOE-2.1E and DOE-2.2
References: <MDAEMON-F200310151317.AA1755375pd80000583215@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200310151729.AA2908281pd80000439471@gard.com>

Major disagreement on Chiller Performance Curves in DOE-2.1E and DOE-2.2Unfortunately, the ARI data for performance at partial loads is not useful in an hourly simulation program, precisely because it makes an assumption about reduced condenser temperature at reduced load.  The assumptions in the ARI curve might be reasonable for a single chiller in a given building and climate, and where you allow the condenser temperature to drop with load and wetbulb.  However, many plants have more than one chiller, the cooling tower(s) may be controlled to a fixed condenser temperature, and/or you might be running the chiller in Florida vs. New Mexico, which have very different load/wetbulb relationships.

It would be useful if ARI recognized these issues, and developed a standard method for reporting chiller performance for use in hourly simulation programs (the same problem also applies to packaged rooftop equipment).  

Note that "standard" ratings assume the evaporator is operating at 44F leaving temperature and 2.4 gpm/ton, and the condenser is operating at 85F entering and 3.0 gpm/ton.  However a centrifugal chiller is custom built to the engineer's specifications.  A chiller in a low-wetbulb climate may be configured to run with 75F entering condenser water, and will surge if operated at 44F/85F.  In other words, many centrifigal chillers cannot operate at the "standard" conditions!

The default curves in recent versions of 2.2 are based on a manufacturer's proprietary data.  They are an improvement over the 2.1e curves, but do not necessarily represent all chillers and all manufacturers.

DOE-2 uses three curves to model chiller performance.  The use of these curves is documented in the Topics manual.  More recent versions of 2.2 modify performance for off-rated condenser flow.  In addition, the PLR curve includes a second term (PLR,dT) to model the condenser relief necessary to achieve savings with a variable-speed drive.

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Major disagreement on Chiller Performance Curves in DOE-2.1E and DOE-2.2


  I am having a "friendly" disagreement with a colleague on what chiller curves to ask for from a manufacturer to input into DOE-2 (could be either 2.1E or 2.2). We both agree that the infamous ARI point for a 100% load should be input. But the curves are where we disagree.

  Is the Default DOE-2 curve for % Power versus % Tons the ARI curve with the allowable reduction in condenser water temperature, or is it based on the FIXED 85?F entering condenser water and FIXED 44?F leaving chilled water ALL the way down the curve?

  Therefore, when I am given a chiller with a variable speed drive installed, what parameters should I ask for in such a Power/Tons to be FIXED ???

John, I think the answer to your question has two parts:
 
1. DOE uses two curves for modifying the full load EIR (1/COP) of a constant
speed chiller.  The first adjusts for part load and the second for
temperature. 
 
I use a curve with fixed CHWT and CWT at various part load conditions (at
design conditions not ARI rated conditions) for the EIR f(PLR) curve (the
one you're asking about) and create a second curve based on various
combinations of CHWT, CWT at full load for the EIR f(LCHWT, ECWT) curve.
The assumption, I think, is that the PLR curve reamins relatively uniform as
the water temperatures change so once you have the shape of the PLR curve
you can account for temperature differences with a second curve.
 
 
2. The above methodology works fine for constant speed chillers but needs to
be modified for variable speed chillers.  Rather than using EIR F(PLR) you
need to use EIR f(PLR,dT).  This curve now accounts for the change in the
difference of the water temperature across the chiller.  See Volume 6 of the
DOE 2.2 v41 reference manual available at www.DOE2.com, there is a section
on chiller performance that explains this much better than I could do.  DOE
2.2 v41 incorporates this change and has default curves for both.
 
It sounds like you both may be correct depending on the type of chiller you
want to model.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Major disagreement on Chiller Performance Curves in
DOE-2.1E and DOE-2.2



I am having a "friendly" disagreement with a colleague on what chiller
curves to ask for from a manufacturer to input into DOE-2 (could be either
2.1E or 2.2). We both agree that the infamous ARI point for a 100% load
should be input. But the curves are where we disagree.

Is the Default DOE-2 curve for % Power versus % Tons the ARI curve with the
allowable reduction in condenser water temperature, or is it based on the
FIXED 85?F entering condenser water and FIXED 44?F leaving chilled water ALL
the way down the curve?

Therefore, when I am given a chiller with a variable speed drive installed,
what parameters should I ask for in such a Power/Tons to be FIXED ???

You can import an AutoCAD file into eQuest, and trace around the envelope to
build your model. I have never done it personally, but it is in the latest
eQuest Training manual.

Major disagreement on Chiller Performance Curves in DOE-2.1E and DOE-2.2The
easy way to settle that is to create a spreadsheet that uses the
coefficients.  You can get them from the .bdl file if you enter DIAGNOSTIC
COMMENTS .. right before your chiller instructions.  Interestingly enough,
that's what I was doing this morning.  I have attached my spreadsheet.
Please excuse that it is not ready for distribution.  Just something I was
playing with.

The coefficients are for DOE-2.2 and do include upgrades since the mid '70s
that DOE-2.1E uses.  The VFD coefficients are new.

As you can see, kW/ton does change with temperatures.

If you want FIXED condenser water temperature and chilled water temperature
(the default), do not turn on the resets.  Condenser water (and maybe
chilled water) will still drift with what the equipment can do.

eQUEST would allow you to quickly build buildings using the Schematic Design
Wizard.  The Schematic Design Wizard has good defaults for many building
types.  Depending on the accuracy you want initially, you could build one
large building very quickly or you could build several models of future
buildings and import them all into a single model for the central plant
analysis.  This second option would also allow you to update the model as
further information became available.
 
If you have the first phase ready to model, you could do that with a
multiplier, or add Schematic Design models of future buildings.

Hello, 

Can anyone recommend software that allows fairly rapid analysis of energy
trade-offs between central plant equipment and configurations, when the
buildings to be served and loads are still speculative?  This is for a
campus that will be built in phases over many years, and most buildings are
only loosely defined. DOE-2 will be more difficult and detailed than
warranted. 

Thank you for your input.

Brian,

Another software I used was Trane System Analyzer.  I found it is very 
effective for a quick energy calc when you don't have a lot of detail 
information on the buildings.  I was able to match the energy bills pretty 
close to the existing buildings.

In SI units, I am not knowledgeable of the existence of

Can someone explain what is the different between energy unit "kWh/m2"
and "kWh/m2a"? What is the letter "a" stand for? If these two units are
different, what is the conversion factor? Thanks.
