How to Make Your CAD Data Do Five Times as Much Work at No Extra Cost

The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, in cooperation with Southern
California Edison (in an event in Santa Monica) and Pacific Gas and
Electric (in an event in San Francisco), will demonstrate the exchange
of architectural and engineering information among various software
applications using IAI's IFC R2.0.  This is a "reality breakthrough;"
after almost six years of developing interoperable standards, the
Alliance is pleased to show that commercial software developers are
delivering products incorporating IAI's IFC standards that will
dramatically change the way professional designers, building owners and
managers, and a host of other AEC+FM professionals will work in the
future.  Commercial vendors such as Timberline Software Corporation,
Microsoft Corporation, and others, will exchange CAD drawings, cost
estimating information, engineering data for energy analysis, and more
at both events.  The attached file provides more background and detail
about what will be shown at the events.

The event in Santa Monica will take place at the Southern California
Edison's Customer Technology Application Center (CTAC), 1721 22nd St.,
Santa Monica, CA 90404, phone (626) 812-7537 or (800) 336-2822, on
Tuesday, February 20 9:00-noon.  The event in San Francisco will take
place the next day (Wednesday, February 21) at the Pacific Gas &
Electric's Pacific Energy Center (PEC), 851 Howard Street, San
Francisco, California 94103, phone (415) 973-7268, also 9:00-noon. 
Please announce these events to your staff.  Those planning to attend
either event should register at the IAI NA web site:

this change will improve the practice in your office in years to come.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.25in'>A group of well known software
developers for the building industry formed the Building Lifecycle
Interoperable Software (BLIS) project and has developed commercial grade
software that can seamlessly exchange IFC-based data developed in CAD
applications for use in cost estimating, thermal analysis, mechanical design,
construction planning and other industry processes. The BLIS group (Fig. 1)
includes industry software leaders such as Microsoft, Graphisoft and
Timberline.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.25in'>It is now possible to take a

define the building in three dimensions using object oriented CAD software and

the simulation of the building?s energy performance.<span style="mso-spacerun:

needed to prepare the building description for such an energy performance

Hi,

there are different ways to achieve this with TRNSYS.

1. If you want to make a new TRNSYS component written in
PASCAL (or any programming language) you need to compile your
sourcecode into a DLL - for PASCAL, it should not be a problem to
find a compiler that can do that. The DLL should be called EXTDLL.DLL.
This user DLL can then be called by TRNSYS, using type 61.

In IISiBat, you can use the "External DLLs" icon (type 61, under "Calling
External routines) or make your own, modelled after type61 (just draw a
new icon for your type and name  its INPUTS, OUTPUTS and
PARAMETERS in the PROFORMA editor in the way you want them
displayed in the Assembly panel).

2. If you want to link a stand-alone application written in PASCAL to
TRNSYS, you can use the type66 which is used to call EES equations
as a model.

Hope this helps,

Werner
PS: These features are only supported in TRNSYS 15 and up.

Hello

Can someone help please.
What is the average annual ground temperature in Paris, France at 1m ,
1.5m, and 2m depth.
Any pointers to further hourly/ monthly data sources would be appreciated.
Thanks

France data source list does not include soil temp, but a Germany set does
which could be "close enough" or could be modified.  

Take a look into work by the University of Minnesota "Underground Space
Center" in the late 80's early 90's.  Also I remember (but don't seem to
have copy of) a paper of soil temperatures and their estimation from other
climate parameters by Dr. Tami Kauda of NIST (then US Bureau of Standards.

I bet there is more literature on this like in Journal of Applied
Meteorology or from WMO.

Do not open any mail with file attachment and subject 

   "Here You Have..." 

or similar, even (especially) if from someone you know.  

McAfee AV caught it here.

It appears similar to Love Bug, in that it is replicating via MicroSoft
e-mail clients.  It sends an attachment that is a VisualBasic runtime which
registers as a JPG file.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200102261045.AA454723pd80000022237@gard.com>

Hello

I am still a beginner using Power DOE.

What is commenly used for the Equipment Sensible ratio in DOE/PowerDOE?

I know that default value is 1, is this commonly used?  I have looked in 
ASHRAE Fundamentals etc but  I would rather not enter a different value for 
each specific piece of equipment.  I wonder what others use?


Thank you in advance for this and for previous help.

kathleen

I use DOE-2.1E. The system is a PTAC one. The above temperatures are in
degrees C.

Design-cool-t = 25; Zone temperature = 25; Cool-temp-sch gives also 25
C.
Min-supply-t = 13.
OA-FLOW/PER = 10 (SI units)
Fans are scheduled to operate between 7 and 17.

The SS-F report signales that all hours are undercooled.
Hourly reports with Variable-type = U-name of zone AND Variable-list =
(6,16,17,18) indicate the following :


MMDDHH ZONE-8      ZONE-8     ZONE-8   ZONE-8
