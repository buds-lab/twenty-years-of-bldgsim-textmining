Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200010201103.AA035892md80000074509@gard.com>

Hi,

I am new to Power DOE and I am getting the following errors:


(I have defined plenum space 1 as zone type plenum, nonconditioned spaces 
1st floor as zone type nonconditioned etc.)

1.   SPACE plenum space 1 has no Zone - one is required

2.   SPACE non-conditioned space 1st floor has no zone - one is
       required

and so son.....



As these are non-conditioned spaces do we need to create the zones? If yes, 
how? Kindly suggest.


Thanking you and with best regards

Mahabir

in the Northeast.

This is a great opportunity for people who are interested in
energy-efficient, solar buildings to visit many different
types of buildings in this nationwide open house.

Hundreds of low energy, solar homes are open to the public
on this free tour as well as schools and businesses. There
are also guided tours. Please feel free to contact me here
at the NESEA office with any questions and happy touring!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200010251746.AA463739md80000075917@gard.com>

Hello Group

We are currently putting together a proposal for work that would be
performed next year which has the requirement that a portion of the work be
performed by a certified California Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise
(DVBE).

We would like to meet this requirement with a DVBE individual who has
expertise in the use of DOE-2 and it's application to evaluating end use
energy use and energy efficient measures in commercial buildings.  This
individual must have at least a BS in Mechanical Engineering and should be
located and currently working in San Diego.

If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond with your
qualifications and hourly rate via e-mail or fax by noon Thursday October
26th to Alan Fields at alan at rer.com.  

Thank you!
