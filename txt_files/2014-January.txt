Subject: [Bldg-sim] Building input data template


Hi All,

We need to collect data for a complete building modelling project from building owners that are not very familiar with the subject. We already have access to various more or less personal input forms, with no or very cursory descriptions of each data item. I expect almost every modeler and company has their own.

What I am looking for is a template where each data item is explained and more carefully defined (in English). It seems to be the sort of thing that must have been developed by, e.g., ASHRAE at some point (and I should probably be well aware of :-).

Gratefully,

Per

Dear Modelers,

The "LS_B Space Peak Load Components" report in eQuest is giving me unusual results.  The Heating Load components are all zero kBtu/H when there is absolutely heating load.  This is happening in a number of zones; although not all.  Happening on multiple systems as well.

Does anyone have any experience with this report giving unexpected results?  How can I get this report to work for me?

Thank you!

Equipment, process, and infiltration heat gains are all very high...These loads would have to reduce in order for the zone to go into heating mode. What are the hourly schedules for the equipment and process loads that you've modeled? Is it possible that even at their lowest they still more than offset any heat losses?

Hello Shana,

The LS-B report in eQuest is a carry-over from the original DOE-2 program when there were separate LOADS, SYSTEMS, PLANT and ECONOMICs input files. Therefore, since this report has a "LS" attribute it is reporting the calculated peak loads for the space "AGL1-1-PROCESS-1", whatever that is. 

Without knowing anything about your building I would suspect that what you are seeing is correct, there are no heating loads for this space, this is why it is reporting none. This can occur when the thermostat is set too low, and/or for other reasons. For example, it appears that you have enormous equipment and process internal loads to the space which are more than likely heating it.

Unfortunately, diagnosing this usually requires a look at the input file to see what's in the space, what's shut-off, and/or what sort of building/process you are trying to simulate. One simple solution is to tinker with the heating setpoint until you see at what point the heating appears. This will give you some idea of what's going on, althought it won't solve the problem.

Also, don't forget that the LS-B is only reporting the loads on the systems, and not the system loads or the plant loads, which requires further diagnostics.

Jeff

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Design Optimisation Competition Gen 2
Message-ID: <770DA51B8CC79343A32830010D6E379A261891F2@PJWXMB-0001L.LEC-ADMIN.dmu.ac.uk>

Dear building simulation users,

The jEPlus team at De Montfort University is organizing the ?second generation? of the Design Optimisation Competition (DOC2014, see: http://optimisationcompetition.org) with DesignBuilder Software Ltd. This competition will be quite different to the other competitions you have known, because you are not only competing with your peers, but also entries from the last round. In DOC2014, we have kept most of the design tasks and criteria identical to DOC2012; therefore the previous entries are still valid. You are free to inspect, analyse, modify an existing design, and submit it as your own entry.

What difference does this make, you may ask. Well, for a start, it gives you a starting point allowing you to focus on improving the design without the need to create a model from scratch. It is much easier to enter the competition even if you are not familiar with DesignBuilder, and your ability to create a winner is less bound by your skills with the software.

Would not the competition be too easy, you asking? Quite the opposite! The bar for winning the competition is in fact very high ? your new design must outperform the champions of the last round to stand a chance. It is a real test to your ingenuity and knowledge of energy and buildings.

As software developers, we of course want to see how our new tools help the competitors in their quest. This competition will test DesignBuilder?s new optimisation tool, and the remote simulation solution by DMU. To find out more about the competition and the tools, please register for the free webinar at 15:00 GMT on Tuesday, 14 January:  http://designbuildersoftwareltd.cmail2.com/t/r-l-nurkthl-fkujdhyu-w/

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Building Energy Performance Analysis Notes
Message-ID: <000001cf0e48$1b503830$51f0a890$@iit.edu>


The web site http://bepan.info/ ?Building Energy Performance Analysis Notes? contains my class notes for teaching ?Energy Efficient Building Design? to graduate students at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) as a part-time Adjunct Professor from Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) LLP.  I retired from SOM in 2006 and I am no longer associated with IIT.


Is there any interest in using the information in the website by a new or existing organization and developing the objectives of this project?  The objectives (which can be revised and expanded) are shown on the HOME page and reproduced below.  The emphasis is on education with case studies to bring A-E design practice into the classroom.  I am going to discard the info if there is no interest.


?BEPAN - OBJECTIVES:

(1) Develop case studies for different types of buildings with energy conservation options using different energy analysis programs. A statistical database of building performance by building types can be useful to A-E firms as a reference guide in the design of, and for projecting the performance of new buildings.

(2) Develop case studies of campuses and townships. Campuses & townships can save energy by using cogeneration plant for power and HVAC. Example: Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) comparing the present IIT campus Mechanical-Electrical Systems with a proposed central system that includes a Cogeneration plant for power and HVAC - http://www.iit.edu/about/campus_map.shtml

(3) Develop courses and graduate programs in energy efficient building design and would emphasize design practice using case studies. The two year graduate programs can be taught part-time by adjunct faculty working full-time at A-E firms if the basic teaching notes are developed by the group.

(4) Develop research topics by Academia in A-E design submitted by A-E design firms. A-E design firms cannot justify the overhead cost of Research & Development but a Group representing A-E design firms can accomplish this with the support of academic research institutions.

A reminder that the webinar launching the 2014 Design Optimisation Competition will take place at 15:00 GMT Tuesday 14 January. You can register for the Webinar by clicking on the link below.

https://www4.gotomeeting.com/register/273603295

The original competition newsletter is included below.

Following on from the success of our last Design Optimisation Competition (www.designbuilder.co.uk/content/view/135/206/) the ADOPT (www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~adopt/wiki/doku.php) research partners are pleased to announce a new competition which offers the opportunity to use the latest DesignBuilder Optimisation tools to solve a challenging building design problem.

[cid:image002.png at 01CEFB5C.C5D9EE80]<http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~adopt/wiki/doku.php?id=competition:submissions>

The purpose of the competition is to promote awareness of a new breed of optimisation tools which can help with decision making at any stage of the design process. These tools provide powerful techniques for identifying optimal designs that meet potentially conflicting design requirements such as minimising environmental impact while also minimising development costs and at the same time satisfying constraints such as providing minimum levels of occupant comfort.

Prizes will be awarded for the most cost effective and environmentally friendly design meeting a challenging functional and performance specification. The first prize will be 500 GBP cash plus an Advanced Simulation Package. Runner up prizes will also be provided.

The competition is open to all comers including professional consultants, academics and students and we particularly support use of the competition as part of University building energy modelling teaching modules.
Participants will get advance access to the DesignBuilder Optimisation software, which will help give them the best possible chance of winning the competition. Optimisation requires many hundreds of simulations to be carried out to perform an accurate analysis. In DesignBuilder these simulations can be run in parallel on your local machine, on a network server or for the fastest results over the internet on the De Montfort University high performance supercomputer. We expect many participants will take DMU up on their generous offer to use this powerful resource at no cost during the competition.

A free Webinar will be held on 14 January 2014 at 15:00 GMT to provide more detailed information on the competition and also on the new DesignBuilder Optimisation tools. Whether you are interested in taking part in the competition, or you would just like to know more about the latest optimisation tools, you are warmly invited to attend.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Plastics factory load assumptions
Message-ID: <CAPsP_xQyVDm3J6tYAsWH8WQQUt26hOnA=VgjyV2rr9=s13wKZg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,
I am looking for some EUI information to use in determining reasonable
process loads.

Currently I have used 2 W /sqft for a simple internal equipment object. The
assumption seems reasonable, but I simply guessed- so am hopeful to find
some reference documentation to base my assumptions on. Alternatively the
design team and I have discussed measuring the equipment at peak or average
load. If we where to measure, it would be great to have some guidelines for
such large equipment.. (school bus size injection plastic molding)

Here is the comment I got from a LEED reviewer:
 *It is not recommended that you use exactly 25% as the value for process
loads. You should estimate, as closely as possible, what your actual
process loads will be, and then use those estimates. Following is an
excerpt of commonly used review text that GBCI uses to address this very
issue, "The unregulated receptacle and process energy should not be
arbitrarily set to 25% of the total baseline building cost, but should
reflect the actual process loads in the appropriate spaces as required by
ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Table G3.1.1(a) and G3.1.12. Revise the proposed and
baseline building energy models as necessary to reflect the actual
unregulated inputs (such as receptacle loads, kitchen loads, elevator
loads, etc.) in the appropriate spaces. In addition, revise the
Supplemental Table 1.4 reflecting the changes. If the process cost is below
25% of the Baseline energy cost after making any necessary changes, provide
an additional narrative justification for the low process cost." Note that
the 25% process load minimum included in the **LEED Reference Guide is not
a requirement. The process loads should be modeled as closely as possible
to the actual process loads. If process loads are significantly less than
25% of the building's total energy loads, then a narrative should be
provided to address how process loads were determined.*

Also, I have been asked to do an exceptional calculation for the highly
efficient factory equipment, however the LEED reviewer wants the
nameplate capacity to be the same.  This would not permit me to use the
method I had previously- the simple internal equipment with
latent sensible split, then radiant convective split.  Also if we measure
the actual equipment then how would we compare to reference equipment..

Here is the comment from another LEED reviewer that my client contacted:
*The energy efficiency measures for [MEASURE DESCRIPTIONS] should be
modeled using the Exceptional Calculation methodology. A narrative should
describe all Baseline and Proposed case assumptions included for this
measure as well as the calculation methodology used to determine the
projected savings. The narrative and energy savings should be reported
separately from the other efficiency measures in Section 1.7 - Table
EAp2-7. The Baseline case description should verify that the manufacturing
equipment installed is not standard practice for a similar newly
constructed facility by referencing a recently published document
(published within five years of the project registration date), utility
program that incentivizes the equipment installed, or by documenting
systems used to perform the same function in other newly constructed
facilities (three facilities built within the past five years of the
project registration date). The baseline system type described should also
have the same output capacity as the proposed system type modeled.*

 So my questions are:

How are factories normally modeled?
 How is such large equipment normally modeled?
  Are there any published benchmarks to reference?
   Are there any guidelines on measuring the performance of such equipment?


Any feedback or ideas are welcome and thanks

Dear colleagues,

We are currently assembling a material library as a basis for energy simulations and the question came up which source we should use to describe the various thermal and optical properties of  typical construction materials? A natural answer seems to be to use the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 2009 Chapter 26 which lists such numbers. Are these the tables that "all" of you are using or am I missing an important resource? What about our Canadian, European and other international friends? Would you scorn at an ASHRAE library and rather use your own numbers? This data input is obviously tedious so we want to avoid having to do repeatedly.

All the best,

Christoph

This is an important and useful activity, especially for those of us who 
are working across national or regional boundaries.
It would be helpful to know what are the sources of technical data in 
places around the world. I would guess that there are
engineering manuals or handbooks equivalent to the ASHRAE HOF in many 
places.

Hi Joe

CIBSE (UK) quotes HOF and, to my knowledge, doesn't use any other sources.

There's a lot of manufacturer data 'in the wild'. Perhaps this is an
opportunity to create such a resource as the WINDOW/ IGDB but for opaque
elements.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Course on natural ventilation simulation using EnergyPlus
Message-ID: <495E30C5-7274-4872-BB68-D0A91A88659B@fc.ul.pt>

One day, free introductory course on natural ventilation simulation using EnergyPlus
Monday 10th of February 2014 ? 9am-4pm, Pacific Energy Center (PEC), 851 Howard Street, San Francisco
Wednesday 12th of February 2014 ? 8:30am-3:30pm, SCE Energy Education Center, 6090 N. Irwindale Ave., Irwindale
Thursday 13th of February 2014 ? 9am-4pm, SDG&E Energy Innovation Center (EIC), 4760 Clairemont Mesa Blvd, San Diego

In California, retrofitting buildings with natural ventilation offers the most potential for reducing energy costs and CO2 emissions associated with cooling. This one-day training session discusses how the new wind-driven natural ventilation modeling capabilities of EnergyPlus can be used to identify and quantify opportunities to implement natural ventilation in new and retrofit commercial building designs. EnergyPlus will be used to study questions such as how many operable windows are needed for a given space and what is the optimal arrangement for either cross ventilation or single-sided ventilation. Building geometry input and results visualization will be based on the recently released Simergy free EnergyPlus graphical interface.

Target audience
The target audiences for this course are design professionals (e.g., HVAC engineers, simulation consultants and architects with an interest in thermal simulation) as well as utility program managers.

Course structure
The course starts with a brief introduction to EnergyPlus and the Simergy interface, allowing for the participation of inexperienced users. The afternoon session introduces the new EnergyPlus natural ventilation modeling capabilities through a set of simple design exercises. The course will be taught by Spencer Dutton and Guilherme Gra?a. Spencer works in the Commercial Building Systems Group and the Simulation Research Group at LBNL. Guilherme is a building energy consultant that has carried out EnergyPlus modeling studies of the San Francisco Federal Office Building, the San Diego Children?s Museum, the New York Times HQ building among others.

What you need
Attendees must bring a laptop with Simergy and EnergyPlus 7.2 installed. For San Francisco please confirm attendance using the email (natventtrainingsf at natural-works.com<mailto:natventtrainingsf at natural-works.com>). For Irwindale and San Diego: online application (please see SCE and SDG&E websites).

Hey Christoph


A source that is slightly dated (1989) but still interesting to read is the report titled: ?The Harmonisation of Thermal Properties of Building Materials? by Joe Clarke and colleaques (www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Documents/89/thermop_rep.pdf?). The background was to collect data to extract information on the uncertainty of the material properties as input to uncertainty propagation studies. Another potential source might be the work of Prof. John Grunewald at the TU Dresden on modelling material properties (http://tu-dresden.de/bauklimatik).



Any chance that you expand on the work of Joe with regards to deriving and publishing uncertainty data on material properties?



Kind regards,



Christian

Betreff: [Bldg-sim] sources for material libraries

Dear colleagues,

We are currently assembling a material library as a basis for energy simulations and the question came up which source we should use to describe the various thermal and optical properties of  typical construction materials? A natural answer seems to be to use the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 2009 Chapter 26 which lists such numbers. Are these the tables that ?all? of you are using or am I missing an important resource? What about our Canadian, European and other international friends? Would you scorn at an ASHRAE library and rather use your own numbers? This data input is obviously tedious so we want to avoid having to do repeatedly.

All the best,

Christoph

All,

For ASHRAE 1199-RP some years ago (2003 - 2004 ish) I scrounged 
around looking for material properties.  Attached is a summary of 
what I came up with for some common materials.  As you can see, there 
is quite a range of opinion for some properties for some materials 
(including cases of different values from 2 different places in 
ASHRAE HOF).  I do not know the source(s) of those differences, in 
some cases there are probably regional differences and/or changes 
over time.  Or maybe just bad measurements.

Moisture content is another variable of which we are all becoming 
more aware.  Lab measurements vs. real-building situations.

Updated versions of some of these sources are probably available.

It would be an excellent project to build up a collection of this 
sort of info in some shared place, such as the IBPSA-USA Wiki 
(bembook.ibpsa.us).

Hey Christoph, OpenStudio has tried to address some of this issue in the online Building Component Library (BCL) at bcl.nrel.gov.  This database includes a variety of material and construction definitions used for energy simulation.  The components on BCL are organized into a taxonomy and include machine readable attributes to support searching.  The materials and constructions also come with premade IDF and OSM payloads so they can easily be included in EnergyPlus simulations.  Rob and I have talked several times about adding content for other simulation engines to (e.g. BSDFs for fenestration constructions to use in Radiance) but we haven't done this yet.  Components (and Measures) in the BCL can be made publically available or can be private to an individual user or group. Finally, the BCL has an API that software tools can use to automatically search, download, and upload components.  The OpenStudio API has methods for interacting with the BCL API, the OpenStudio applications use this to allow for searching and downloading measures and components directly in the OpenStudio GUIs.

Materials:
https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site?f[0]=im_field_component_tags%3A157<https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site?f%5b0%5d=im_field_component_tags%3A157>

Example Material (Brick):
https://bcl.nrel.gov/node/34420

Constructions:
https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site?f[0]=im_field_component_tags%3A127<https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site?f%5b0%5d=im_field_component_tags%3A127>

Example Construction (189.1-2009 Nonres 1A Exterior Mass Wall):
https://bcl.nrel.gov/node/2930

BCL API:
https://bcl.nrel.gov/developer

The BCL doesn't really provide guidance on what constructions and materials to use, it is more about providing a common place to store these things and an API to make them accessible.  There is a rating system so users can vote for their favorite components.

Just let us know if you'd like to know any more,
Dan

Hello,

A project I'm building the energy model for is considering switching to electric heat. I understand that generally you would use the predominant HVAC system, so if the "predominant" system is electric, you would use System 8. See highlighted excerpt below.

My question to you is: what qualifies as "predominant"? Is there some percentage of energy consumption assigned to gas and electricity that signifies either as being dominant?

Thank you for the clarification.

The predominant condition is the one that serves the largest conditioned area.  This note is referring back to G3.1.1 exception a which allows the use of additional baseline system type(s) for non-predominant conditions if they are greater than 20k ft2.

In Argentina we have a local standard (IRAM 11601), which specify
material's hygrothermal properties. I attached the "envelope performance

their properties *(in spanish!)* in case anyone is interested. IMO the
second source most widely used here would be ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook.

Chip, others,

I was thinking along that line when I posted my comment on this topic last night.  What 
about proposing this as an activity to IBPSA World (?) where interested chapters in each 
country or region would compile their sources of material properties, and if there's 
sufficient interest, the properties themselves?  That would sure beat anyone in one place 
trying to compile data from the whole world, although some central coordination would be 
vital to make sure everyone is consistent in reporting their material properties.  I would 
also like to see that extended to commonly used calculation methods for heat transfer, 
such as for foundation heat flows, infiltration, and two-dimensional heat transfer. In my 
experience in China, every building energy code contains the same standard description of 
of how to derive equivalent U-factors for thermal bridging, which is a significant heat 
loss factor because 99% of the construction is heavy mass concrete, yet in the US only the 
real "nerds" ever bother with thermal bridging (even I don't! ).  I see many benefits from 
such an activity - (1) the local chapters would get clarity on what's different (or not) 
with the conditions in their country, (2) people working across national boundaries would 
be able to improve their modeling (I'm always bothered by people creating "ASHRAE-90" 
models for buildings in non-Western locations, as if all that differs is the climate), and 
(3) we might all learn something new and unexpected.

Hi all,

I'm trying to calculate what the loads will be for a space that includes
vegetation (no trees or anything big just green indoor planting). How would
I estimate the latent energy that these plants would require from my HVAC
design?

Are there any rules of thumb that people go by to estimate this, perhaps on
a W/m2?

Thanks for any advice,
Sebastian

Christoph,
I like using the ASHRAE Load Calculation Applications Manual.  It has a lot of the load calculation procedures and data in one easy to reference place.  Plus it's from 2008 so has been updated from research projects in the proceeding 10-20 years.  A lot of the building material thermal performance figures are taken directly from ASHRAE Handbook - Fundamentals though.

Dear colleagues,

We are currently assembling a material library as a basis for energy simulations and the question came up which source we should use to describe the various thermal and optical properties of  typical construction materials? A natural answer seems to be to use the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 2009 Chapter 26 which lists such numbers. Are these the tables that "all" of you are using or am I missing an important resource? What about our Canadian, European and other international friends? Would you scorn at an ASHRAE library and rather use your own numbers? This data input is obviously tedious so we want to avoid having to do repeatedly.

All the best,

Christoph

LBNL WINDOW / THERM integration might be a good model to follow in this
respect (though I think there are some issues with the relevance of igdb
data).

Like Joe, I don't tend to work out thermal bridging.

To expand on what Paul said, ISO 10456 is definitely the most relevant norm at the European level, but there are others that might be of use. Especially if you want to account for thermal bridges without using a heat transfer modeling software such as THERM: you could find a linear thermal bridge coefficient (Psi-value) in EN ISO 10211. Or you want to model ground heat transfer (ISO 13370).

European norms that are relevant to the question are the following (extracted from the French "energy code" (r?gles Th-U fascicule 4)) 

EN ISO 7345 - Thermal insulation - Physical quantities and definitions

EN ISO 13789 - Thermal performance of buildings -- Transmission and ventilation heat transfer coefficients -- Calculation method

EN ISO 10456 - Building materials and products -- Hygrothermal properties -- Tabulated design values and procedures for determining declared and design thermal values

EN ISO 6946 - Building components and building elements. Thermal resistance and thermal transmittance. Calculation method 

EN ISO 13370 - Thermal performance of buildings. Heat transfer via the ground. Calculation methods 

EN ISO 10211-1 - Thermal bridges in building construction -- Heat flows and surface temperatures -- Detailed calculations

EN ISO 10211-2 - Thermal bridges in building construction. Heat flows and surface temperatures ?- Linear thermal bridges

Hello Christopher,

I?ve done the MPE design work for 26 fire stations in Texas over the past 6 years.  In none of these is there any requirement for hot water serving the apparatus bay.  Fire engine washing is only done with cold water (a 2-inch line for both washing and tank filling.)  The only qualification is that all of these were in Texas.  Requirements may be different elsewhere.

Best regards,

P.S.  Hot water for domestic use is done as though it is a dormitory.

the various ISO standards for 2 and 3D thermal simulations have a decent material list with conductivities, etc.  For other, we generally use ASHRAE, etc.

Hello everyone,

Does anyone know of any published energy consumption data for museums? CBECS has a public assembly category, but I am hoping to get more specific data for museums. I understand that the numbers are going to be very diverse given the nature of a museum program but still hoping that there's something out there.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] sources for material libraries - one from 1990....
Message-ID: <D30AFF4D10A0B64490B23B07B41010D41A72F0DA@EX2010-MBX3.ds.strath.ac.uk>


The grandfather report on material properties might just be the July 1990 report "The Harmonisation
of the Thermal Properties of Building Materials" by J A Clarke, P Yaneske and A Pinney
a Report for Project EM243 Construction Industry Directorate, Department of the
Environment.  Much of this then found its way into the CIBSE Guide. The report
looked at information from ~dozen sources.

I have recently been updating the ESP-r material databases with annotations from
this Report e.g. impermeables, non-hygroscopic, inorganic-porous etc.  as well
as the www reference for information sources of specific materials.

ESP-r also has some default values for linear thermal bridges (which can be assigned
to each surface-edge-join in the model) but tends to rely on users to supply information.

Regards, Jon Hand, ESRU, Glasgow

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] sources for material libraries

To expand on what Paul said, ISO 10456 is definitely the most relevant norm at the European level, but there are others that might be of use. Especially if you want to account for thermal bridges without using a heat transfer modeling software such as THERM: you could find a linear thermal bridge coefficient (Psi-value) in EN ISO 10211. Or you want to model ground heat transfer (ISO 13370).

European norms that are relevant to the question are the following (extracted from the French "energy code" (r?gles Th-U fascicule 4))

EN ISO 7345 - Thermal insulation - Physical quantities and definitions

EN ISO 13789 - Thermal performance of buildings -- Transmission and ventilation heat transfer coefficients -- Calculation method

EN ISO 10456 - Building materials and products -- Hygrothermal properties -- Tabulated design values and procedures for determining declared and design thermal values

EN ISO 6946 - Building components and building elements. Thermal resistance and thermal transmittance. Calculation method

EN ISO 13370 - Thermal performance of buildings. Heat transfer via the ground. Calculation methods

EN ISO 10211-1 - Thermal bridges in building construction -- Heat flows and surface temperatures -- Detailed calculations

EN ISO 10211-2 - Thermal bridges in building construction. Heat flows and surface temperatures ?- Linear thermal bridges

Hi,

 

Centre for Advanced Research in Building Science and Energy (CARBSE) at CEPT
University has developed a wall and roof construction thermal transmittance
or thermal Conductance (U - Factor) calculator. Thermal properties of
materials used by the tool are derived by extensive characterization of
generic construction materials available in various parts of India. Majority
glass products available in India is also characterised, data of such glass
products are available in IGDB. Values have been derived by accredited lab

 

This is an online tool, to be accessed freely over internet. The values
derived by the tool are specific for the city. Thermal properties of
materials used by the tool are derived by extensive characterization of
generic construction materials available in various parts of India. 

 

The tool can be useful for selection of building material, construction, for
building energy modelling and analysis as well as for code compliance.

 

 <http://www.carbse.org/resource/tools/>

For more information please contact us, we will be happy to extend database
of material as well. 

 

Currently, we are in process of characterising wall and window assemblies.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Data center modeling
Message-ID: <5FB5D3C0-4FF2-4AA0-8150-42D9E5D9F1DA@gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a question about data center modeling for leed.
According to leed version 4, we are required to model the baseline using appendix G and data center guidelines. Which book has these guidelines?

I am not sure where to find these guidelines to understand what does a data center guideline mean.

Does it relate more to operating temperature in data room and IT rack w/ft2?

Does the HVAC system used to model the baseline for data center is still based on the total square ft and number of storeys in the building.

Your reply is greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Amit

Message-ID: <002c01cf16c1$7eb4a1a0$7c1de4e0$@greenlivingprojects.com>

Hi everyone,

 

We are working on a model where two different water-side system will be used

for both cooling and heating.

 

One will be a geothermal heat pump that will cover base loads. The second

system will be an electrical heat pump that will be operates during peak

loads.

 

We tried to model the whole system but we found that it is not possible to

model a combination system for heating and cooling in eQuest.

 

Do you have any suggestion about modeling the above configuration?

 

Thank you in advance

That was a disappointment.  I was expecting to learn "how to develop 
complex energy models and effective modeling workflows, apply 
crowd-sourced model components and improvements, and analyze models to 
rapidly identify design and improvement opportunities, and more.."  I 
got none of that. What I got was a overview of the capabilities and a 
slide show with static slides.  The speaker said the software would do 
those things, but did not demonstrate anything.  Basically, the same 
information I already got from the OpenStudio web site.  When audience 
members asked for specifics and demonstrations, a call screener said 
answers would be provided later.  The speaker spoke too fast and 
finished almost 30 minutes early.  There was plenty of time to do at 
least a simple demonstration.

I'm wondering if NREL chose the right people to provide OpenStudio 
training.  Based on their performance last Thursday, I'd say no.

I would agree with the assessment below. It was not at all what I was
expecting. Interesting if you are a software developer, but otherwise, not. 

 

I think that the presenter did not know who the intended audience was. Or
the presentation was not marketed properly, so that the right audience would
attend.

That was a disappointment.  I was expecting to learn "how to develop complex
energy models and effective modeling workflows, apply crowd-sourced model
components and improvements, and analyze models to rapidly identify design
and improvement opportunities, and more.."  I got none of that.  What I got
was a overview of the capabilities and a slide show with static slides.  The
speaker said the software would do those things, but did not demonstrate
anything.  Basically, the same information I already got from the OpenStudio
web site.  When audience members asked for specifics and demonstrations, a
call screener said answers would be provided later.  The speaker spoke too
fast and finished almost 30 minutes early.  There was plenty of time to do
at least a simple demonstration.

I'm wondering if NREL chose the right people to provide OpenStudio training.
Based on their performance last Thursday, I'd say no.

Dear Forum,
I am modeling a supermarket which has made effort to install refrigerated casework that is more efficient than "normal" in three ways:
*             Casework lighting is LED instead of fluorescent
*             Evaporator fans use ECM motors and are demonstrably more efficient
*             The compressors have higher COP
I did not realize that claiming savings from a "process" load also requires substantiation of the Baseline energy for the process load via comparison to several similar facilities or a published paper.  I wish I knew that months ago!
We have data from three other supermarkets owned by the same company, but these other examples are not identical.  So far, all I can say is that:
a)            Manufacturer literature claims that LEDs used in their casework use ~ 65% less energy than fluorescent lights
b)            ECM fans use about 35% less energy in a manufacturer power comparison table
c)            The COP is better (I do not have detailed data yet)

This strikes me as a fairly weak argument, so I am asking you for suggestions or published data to strengthen the argument.

p.s., My last alternative is to ignore the process energy savings and make it the same for both models.  I think the savings are substantial, however, and would rather find a way to claim them!

Jim,

For the lights I would do a quick calculation of the Wattages of equal 
illumination lighting.  Whatever the case manufacturer would use in 
their BASELINE models.  I'm sure the LEDs are an upgrade, so just base 
the savings on the wattages and the hours of operation.  That one should 
be easy.

You could basically do the same thing with the COP.  As long as it is 
for the entire system, you can use a reasonable load and just multiply 
it out.  I'd try that anyway.  You might get shot down, but then you can 
always come back with different.

I'm not so sure about the ECM fans.  Where is the savings?  If they are 
variable speed, then there are some studies on variable speed fans 
versus constant speed fans, but they should be application specific / 
load profile specific.  I have seen ECM fan coil fans that save 
approximately nothing.

I believe that utilities give rebates and incentives for refrigeration 
upgrades like these.  Maybe the local utility does that.  Maybe PG&E 
does that.  If so, they may be able to steer you to a paper.


Good luck!

Hi Jim,

Just to clarify, are those open or closed refrigerated units? (Is there a
door?)

How many are we talking about? (kW or tons)

Are the compressors integrated within the unit (heat rejection within the
conditioned area) or do you have condensers outside? If you do, are you
also reusing waste heat to produce either hot water or heating?


When you say you have data from other stores but they are not identical,
what do you mean? Isn't there a unit that is similar (or exactly the same)
to those previously installed (reading your email I believe the
replacements have already been made in your studied building) where you
could strap a pulse meter for example for at least a couple of weeks?

Best,

The LEED for Retail New Construction and Major Renovations reference guide under EAc1 outlines a baseline refrigeration system.  We have used this for Austin Energy Green Build in the past.  It does a pretty good job but is a little vague on some of your issues.  The Energy Trust of Oregon has a version as well: http://energytrust.org/library/forms/NBE_PG_TechGuidelines.pdf.

Julien,

?         There is a mix of open and closed cases

?         Compressors are external to the cases and condenser is outdoors

?         Waste heat is being captured from one of the systems

?         The other stores have a different mix of cases and it is not practical to measure comparable portions

The LEED for Retail New Construction and Major Renovations reference guide under EAc1 outlines a baseline refrigeration system.  We have used this for Austin Energy Green Build in the past.  It does a pretty good job but is a little vague on some of your issues.  The Energy Trust of Oregon has a version as well: http://energytrust.org/library/forms/NBE_PG_TechGuidelines.pdf.

Dear Forum,
I am modeling a supermarket which has made effort to install refrigerated casework that is more efficient than ?normal? in three ways:
?             Casework lighting is LED instead of fluorescent
?             Evaporator fans use ECM motors and are demonstrably more efficient
?             The compressors have higher COP
I did not realize that claiming savings from a ?process? load also requires substantiation of the Baseline energy for the process load via comparison to several similar facilities or a published paper.  I wish I knew that months ago!
We have data from three other supermarkets owned by the same company, but these other examples are not identical.  So far, all I can say is that:
a)            Manufacturer literature claims that LEDs used in their casework use ~ 65% less energy than fluorescent lights
b)            ECM fans use about 35% less energy in a manufacturer power comparison table
c)            The COP is better (I do not have detailed data yet)

This strikes me as a fairly weak argument, so I am asking you for suggestions or published data to strengthen the argument.

p.s., My last alternative is to ignore the process energy savings and make it the same for both models.  I think the savings are substantial, however, and would rather find a way to claim them!

Jim,

The 2013 version of ASHRAE Standard 90.1 added requirements for refrigerated casework. I suggest you identify where your project exceeds those requirements and make the case to USGBC that what is in 90.1 should be the baseline. Good luck.

For those of you looking for video demonstrations that show how to use the 
features of OpenStudio, setup a simple building simulation, and review the 
results, I suggest you check out OpenStudio's Youtube channel, 
https://www.youtube.com/user/NRELOpenStudio. I thought that the training 
on January 16th was a good overview of the background and future goals of 
the OpenStudio project. I imagine that there will be additional webinars 
in the future which help address some of your concerns as well.

Jim,

There is a similar baseline description of commercial refrigeration systems in Alliant Energy?s Technical Guide Book 2012. Start on page 124 of  http://www.alliantenergy.com/wcm/groups/wcm_internet/@int/documents/document/mdaw/mdiz/~edisp/023759.pdf.
Info for anti-condensate door heater controls starts on page 119.
Info for LED lighting in refrigeration cases starts on page 48.

The State of Illinois also publishes deemed savings values for various upgrades in their Technical Reference Manual (TRM). See Section 4.6 for refrigeration. http://www.ilsag.info/il_trm_version_2.html

ComEd incentives for refrigeration upgrades are listed in https://www.comed.com/Documents/business-savings/SIFYB_PY6_Refrigeration.pdf.

Some of the measures in the above references are specifically for upgrading existing equipment, not new construction, so read the fine print carefully.

I hope this helps!

In case you don?t have 90.1-2013, Addendum g to 90.1-2010 is the one that added energy requirements for refrigeration cases (see attached, I believe the addenda are free downloads).

As someone who has gone through the exceptional calculation method for process loads with LEED, I would recommend using this guidance as your baseline if you show a significant improvement with your design because establishing a baseline for process loads can be challenging (read:  lots of extra time spent).

Jim,

The 2013 version of ASHRAE Standard 90.1 added requirements for refrigerated casework. I suggest you identify where your project exceeds those requirements and make the case to USGBC that what is in 90.1 should be the baseline. Good luck.

Dear Forum,
I am modeling a supermarket which has made effort to install refrigerated casework that is more efficient than ?normal? in three ways:
?             Casework lighting is LED instead of fluorescent
?             Evaporator fans use ECM motors and are demonstrably more efficient
?             The compressors have higher COP
I did not realize that claiming savings from a ?process? load also requires substantiation of the Baseline energy for the process load via comparison to several similar facilities or a published paper.  I wish I knew that months ago!
We have data from three other supermarkets owned by the same company, but these other examples are not identical.  So far, all I can say is that:
a)            Manufacturer literature claims that LEDs used in their casework use ~ 65% less energy than fluorescent lights
b)            ECM fans use about 35% less energy in a manufacturer power comparison table
c)            The COP is better (I do not have detailed data yet)

This strikes me as a fairly weak argument, so I am asking you for suggestions or published data to strengthen the argument.

p.s., My last alternative is to ignore the process energy savings and make it the same for both models.  I think the savings are substantial, however, and would rather find a way to claim them!

Jim,
I have not modeled casework in a while but I recall the frustration over defining the baseline and claiming savings.  The LEED 2009 for Retail rating system literature addressed several of these parameters and maybe version 4 does too. When available, it is best to cite their own literature back to them.
Good luck,

Hi,

I'm trying to model a DOAS system in EE4: the building is a high rise
building where OA is supplied to the rooms via corridors. This air is
tempered before supplying it to the corridors.

How would I set this up in EE4?

Thanks for any help,
Sebastian

Subject: [Bldg-sim] displacement ventilation with low ceiling height
Message-ID: <20140127170106.GC19973@eryd-W150HRM>

Folks,

Some innocent (read: ignorant) questions about DV:
What if a displacement ventilation system is applied to spaces with 
low ceiling height:

1. Is there any negative consequence? I know that the benefits of DV 
will not be achieved. But I see this as a missed opportunity, not a 
negative consequence.

2. What will the air distribution be? Will it change into a mixed 
ventilation? This is related to the above question. If the only 
consequence of DV with low ceiling height is that it will be switched 
back to a mixed ventilation, then there is really no negative effect 
of using DV with low ceiling height.

3. Or may be there a cost consideration in this? is DV generally more 
expensive than mixed air system?

4. Can the above questions be answered with EnergyPlus's DV model?

Any pointers to previous studies on this will be greately appreciated?

Thanks,

Ery

CASE is pleased to announce that we will be hosting the first of many
OpenStudio workshops aimed at providing individuals in the AEC industry
with the knowledge and tools to enhance their workflows around providing
whole building energy analysis. We have been working hard on formalizing
the curriculum for these workshops and have recently been listed as an
authorized training facility by the NREL, the primary developers of
OpenStudio. The first workshop will be held at*CASE HQ* in NYC, but we plan
on taking these workshops on the road and making them available to all our
valued clients across the map. The workshop will cover essential workflows
for conducting whole building analysis inside of OpenStudio. With the
platform being built on top of EnergyPlus, the OpenStudio suite of tools
can meet the most rigorous demands of clients, green building incentives
and utility companies.

We are delighted to offer to host you at *CASE HQ* for a OpenStudio

Dear simulators,

The time is here again to submit articles and announcements for the upcoming issue of IBPSA News (April 2014).  As usual, it would be good to receive an announcement from each IBPSA Affiliate as to activities that have taken place in their region, including conferences and meetings. Items related to software news are also encouraged: new releases, updates, new versions, training seminars, notable projects, etc. - all gratefully received.

Please send the article(s) to me at your earliest convenience so they arrive before 21st March 2014, if possible.

Many thanks for your assistance and contributions.

Best regards,

Christina Hopfe
IBPSA News Editor-in-Chief

Dear all,

ASHRAE 90.1 - 2007, App G
typical office building
Climate zone 4a

A mixing box should operate predominantly on re-circ whilst introducing a
minimal amount of fresh air to the building (such as that required to meet
ASHRAE 62.1).

Does anybody else find the tables G3.1.2.6A & B confusing?

Cheers

Chris

Sorry this was a question! I was just trying to be concise but realised
when I re-read that it was incomplete.

It appears that an economizer is not applicable to a baseline building in
this case. However, G.3.1.2.6B infers that there may still be a high limit
shutoff.

I thought the high limit shutoff was the economizer!

Grateful for your longsuffering patience!

Dear Chris,
4a does not appear to be referenced in Table 6B...
Regardless, the two tables go together and a high limit is not applicable if no economizer is used.
p.s., I don't recall, but I think my red marks reflect some addenda.

G3.1.2.6.B and corresponding section G3.1.2.7 do not kick in if economizers aren't required.

Presentation 1

Title: Data Mining: Get More Out of your Energy Models

Shreshth Nagpal, Associate, Atelier Ten

The presenters will talk about data discovery as a specific subset of data
visualization. In particular about utilizing interactive graphics that
provide a better way to query, filter and sort data; as analysis tools that
find and express relationships between a multitude of design parameters.

About the Speaker: With over a decade of experience in the field of
high-performance building design, Shreshth is an expert in the application
of building performance simulation and analysis for architectural design
and systems optimization. A key member of the Atelier Ten Energy Analysis
practice, he brings to the team his experience in building energy analysis
including renewable energy systems and optimization of high-performance
building envelope, mechanical, and electrical systems.

Shreshth plays an integral role in leading Atelier Ten as a Technical
Assistance (TA) provider to the New York State Energy Research and
Development Authority's (NYSERDA) New Construction Program (NCP). He has
worked on many of the firm's most ambitious projects including the LEED
Gold targeted Ruth Chu Chao Center at Harvard Business School, the LEED
Gold targeted Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York
City, and a pair of LEED Platinum targeted office towers in Sao Paulo,
Brazil.

Shreshth holds a MS Building Design from Arizona State University and a B.
Arch from the School of Planning and Architecture in Delhi, India. He is a
registered architect with the Council of Architecture (COA) in India, a
LEED-Accredited Professional, and an ASHRAE certified Building Energy
Modeling Professional (BEMP) and High-Performance Building Design
Professional (HBDP).

A proposed building will only use H&V for a warehouse type space.

Is it possible to use the normal HVAC baseline system (mapped to be system 11, 'packaged RTU) and then ONLY H&V for proposed?

Michelle,

 

In case you didn't get an answer to your question yesterday afternoon.

 

Sounds like you are looking at the system types in Section 11 (ECB method),
but for LEED projects, the appendix G modeling protocol must be used
(Performance Rating Method). As for the H&V only warehouse, you should look
at Addendum dn to 90.1-2007 which establishes H&V baseline systems and
provides some guidance. Alternatively, you can look in 90.1-2010 Appendix G.

 

Hope this helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Building input data template


Hi All,

We need to collect data for a complete building modelling project from building owners that are not very familiar with the subject. We already have access to various more or less personal input forms, with no or very cursory descriptions of each data item. I expect almost every modeler and company has their own.

What I am looking for is a template where each data item is explained and more carefully defined (in English). It seems to be the sort of thing that must have been developed by, e.g., ASHRAE at some point (and I should probably be well aware of :-).

Gratefully,

Per

Dear Modelers,

The "LS_B Space Peak Load Components" report in eQuest is giving me unusual results.  The Heating Load components are all zero kBtu/H when there is absolutely heating load.  This is happening in a number of zones; although not all.  Happening on multiple systems as well.

Does anyone have any experience with this report giving unexpected results?  How can I get this report to work for me?

Thank you!

To clarify,

Here is a screen shot of one of the zones.  Cooling load is calculating, heating load is not calculating.

Any thoughts would be much appreciated.  Thanks!

Equipment, process, and infiltration heat gains are all very high...These loads would have to reduce in order for the zone to go into heating mode. What are the hourly schedules for the equipment and process loads that you've modeled? Is it possible that even at their lowest they still more than offset any heat losses?

Hello Shana,

The LS-B report in eQuest is a carry-over from the original DOE-2 program when there were separate LOADS, SYSTEMS, PLANT and ECONOMICs input files. Therefore, since this report has a "LS" attribute it is reporting the calculated peak loads for the space "AGL1-1-PROCESS-1", whatever that is. 

Without knowing anything about your building I would suspect that what you are seeing is correct, there are no heating loads for this space, this is why it is reporting none. This can occur when the thermostat is set too low, and/or for other reasons. For example, it appears that you have enormous equipment and process internal loads to the space which are more than likely heating it.

Unfortunately, diagnosing this usually requires a look at the input file to see what's in the space, what's shut-off, and/or what sort of building/process you are trying to simulate. One simple solution is to tinker with the heating setpoint until you see at what point the heating appears. This will give you some idea of what's going on, althought it won't solve the problem.

Also, don't forget that the LS-B is only reporting the loads on the systems, and not the system loads or the plant loads, which requires further diagnostics.

To clarify,

Here is a screen shot of one of the zones.  Cooling load is calculating, heating load is not calculating.

Any thoughts would be much appreciated.  Thanks!

The "LS_B Space Peak Load Components" report in eQuest is giving me unusual results.  The Heating Load components are all zero kBtu/H when there is absolutely heating load.  This is happening in a number of zones; although not all.  Happening on multiple systems as well.

Dear building simulation users,

The jEPlus team at De Montfort University is organizing the ?second generation? of the Design Optimisation Competition (DOC2014, see: http://optimisationcompetition.org) with DesignBuilder Software Ltd. This competition will be quite different to the other competitions you have known, because you are not only competing with your peers, but also entries from the last round. In DOC2014, we have kept most of the design tasks and criteria identical to DOC2012; therefore the previous entries are still valid. You are free to inspect, analyse, modify an existing design, and submit it as your own entry.

What difference does this make, you may ask. Well, for a start, it gives you a starting point allowing you to focus on improving the design without the need to create a model from scratch. It is much easier to enter the competition even if you are not familiar with DesignBuilder, and your ability to create a winner is less bound by your skills with the software.

Would not the competition be too easy, you asking? Quite the opposite! The bar for winning the competition is in fact very high ? your new design must outperform the champions of the last round to stand a chance. It is a real test to your ingenuity and knowledge of energy and buildings.

As software developers, we of course want to see how our new tools help the competitors in their quest. This competition will test DesignBuilder?s new optimisation tool, and the remote simulation solution by DMU. To find out more about the competition and the tools, please register for the free webinar at 15:00 GMT on Tuesday, 14 January:  http://designbuildersoftwareltd.cmail2.com/t/r-l-nurkthl-fkujdhyu-w/

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Building Energy Performance Analysis Notes
Message-ID: <000001cf0e48$1b503830$51f0a890$@iit.edu>


The web site http://bepan.info/ ?Building Energy Performance Analysis Notes? contains my class notes for teaching ?Energy Efficient Building Design? to graduate students at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) as a part-time Adjunct Professor from Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) LLP.  I retired from SOM in 2006 and I am no longer associated with IIT.


Is there any interest in using the information in the website by a new or existing organization and developing the objectives of this project?  The objectives (which can be revised and expanded) are shown on the HOME page and reproduced below.  The emphasis is on education with case studies to bring A-E design practice into the classroom.  I am going to discard the info if there is no interest.


?BEPAN - OBJECTIVES:

(1) Develop case studies for different types of buildings with energy conservation options using different energy analysis programs. A statistical database of building performance by building types can be useful to A-E firms as a reference guide in the design of, and for projecting the performance of new buildings.

(2) Develop case studies of campuses and townships. Campuses & townships can save energy by using cogeneration plant for power and HVAC. Example: Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) comparing the present IIT campus Mechanical-Electrical Systems with a proposed central system that includes a Cogeneration plant for power and HVAC - http://www.iit.edu/about/campus_map.shtml

(3) Develop courses and graduate programs in energy efficient building design and would emphasize design practice using case studies. The two year graduate programs can be taught part-time by adjunct faculty working full-time at A-E firms if the basic teaching notes are developed by the group.

(4) Develop research topics by Academia in A-E design submitted by A-E design firms. A-E design firms cannot justify the overhead cost of Research & Development but a Group representing A-E design firms can accomplish this with the support of academic research institutions.

https://www4.gotomeeting.com/register/273603295

The original competition newsletter is included below.

Following on from the success of our last Design Optimisation Competition (www.designbuilder.co.uk/content/view/135/206/) the ADOPT (www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~adopt/wiki/doku.php) research partners are pleased to announce a new competition which offers the opportunity to use the latest DesignBuilder Optimisation tools to solve a challenging building design problem.

[cid:image002.png at 01CEFB5C.C5D9EE80]<http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~adopt/wiki/doku.php?id=competition:submissions>

The purpose of the competition is to promote awareness of a new breed of optimisation tools which can help with decision making at any stage of the design process. These tools provide powerful techniques for identifying optimal designs that meet potentially conflicting design requirements such as minimising environmental impact while also minimising development costs and at the same time satisfying constraints such as providing minimum levels of occupant comfort.

Prizes will be awarded for the most cost effective and environmentally friendly design meeting a challenging functional and performance specification. The first prize will be 500 GBP cash plus an Advanced Simulation Package. Runner up prizes will also be provided.

The competition is open to all comers including professional consultants, academics and students and we particularly support use of the competition as part of University building energy modelling teaching modules.
Participants will get advance access to the DesignBuilder Optimisation software, which will help give them the best possible chance of winning the competition. Optimisation requires many hundreds of simulations to be carried out to perform an accurate analysis. In DesignBuilder these simulations can be run in parallel on your local machine, on a network server or for the fastest results over the internet on the De Montfort University high performance supercomputer. We expect many participants will take DMU up on their generous offer to use this powerful resource at no cost during the competition.

A free Webinar will be held on 14 January 2014 at 15:00 GMT to provide more detailed information on the competition and also on the new DesignBuilder Optimisation tools. Whether you are interested in taking part in the competition, or you would just like to know more about the latest optimisation tools, you are warmly invited to attend.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Plastics factory load assumptions
Message-ID: <CAPsP_xQyVDm3J6tYAsWH8WQQUt26hOnA=VgjyV2rr9=s13wKZg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,
I am looking for some EUI information to use in determining reasonable
process loads.

Currently I have used 2 W /sqft for a simple internal equipment object. The
assumption seems reasonable, but I simply guessed- so am hopeful to find
some reference documentation to base my assumptions on. Alternatively the
design team and I have discussed measuring the equipment at peak or average
load. If we where to measure, it would be great to have some guidelines for
such large equipment.. (school bus size injection plastic molding)

Here is the comment I got from a LEED reviewer:
 *It is not recommended that you use exactly 25% as the value for process
loads. You should estimate, as closely as possible, what your actual
process loads will be, and then use those estimates. Following is an
excerpt of commonly used review text that GBCI uses to address this very
issue, "The unregulated receptacle and process energy should not be
arbitrarily set to 25% of the total baseline building cost, but should
reflect the actual process loads in the appropriate spaces as required by
ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Table G3.1.1(a) and G3.1.12. Revise the proposed and
baseline building energy models as necessary to reflect the actual
unregulated inputs (such as receptacle loads, kitchen loads, elevator
loads, etc.) in the appropriate spaces. In addition, revise the
Supplemental Table 1.4 reflecting the changes. If the process cost is below
25% of the Baseline energy cost after making any necessary changes, provide
an additional narrative justification for the low process cost." Note that
the 25% process load minimum included in the **LEED Reference Guide is not
a requirement. The process loads should be modeled as closely as possible
to the actual process loads. If process loads are significantly less than
25% of the building's total energy loads, then a narrative should be
provided to address how process loads were determined.*

Also, I have been asked to do an exceptional calculation for the highly
efficient factory equipment, however the LEED reviewer wants the
nameplate capacity to be the same.  This would not permit me to use the
method I had previously- the simple internal equipment with
latent sensible split, then radiant convective split.  Also if we measure
the actual equipment then how would we compare to reference equipment..

Here is the comment from another LEED reviewer that my client contacted:
*The energy efficiency measures for [MEASURE DESCRIPTIONS] should be
modeled using the Exceptional Calculation methodology. A narrative should
describe all Baseline and Proposed case assumptions included for this
measure as well as the calculation methodology used to determine the
projected savings. The narrative and energy savings should be reported
separately from the other efficiency measures in Section 1.7 - Table
EAp2-7. The Baseline case description should verify that the manufacturing
equipment installed is not standard practice for a similar newly
constructed facility by referencing a recently published document
(published within five years of the project registration date), utility
program that incentivizes the equipment installed, or by documenting
systems used to perform the same function in other newly constructed
facilities (three facilities built within the past five years of the
project registration date). The baseline system type described should also
have the same output capacity as the proposed system type modeled.*

 So my questions are:

How are factories normally modeled?
 How is such large equipment normally modeled?
  Are there any published benchmarks to reference?
   Are there any guidelines on measuring the performance of such equipment?


Any feedback or ideas are welcome and thanks

Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E8037C14614@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues,

We are currently assembling a material library as a basis for energy simulations and the question came up which source we should use to describe the various thermal and optical properties of  typical construction materials? A natural answer seems to be to use the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 2009 Chapter 26 which lists such numbers. Are these the tables that "all" of you are using or am I missing an important resource? What about our Canadian, European and other international friends? Would you scorn at an ASHRAE library and rather use your own numbers? This data input is obviously tedious so we want to avoid having to do repeatedly.

All the best,

Christoph

This is an important and useful activity, especially for those of us who 
are working across national or regional boundaries.
It would be helpful to know what are the sources of technical data in 
places around the world. I would guess that there are
engineering manuals or handbooks equivalent to the ASHRAE HOF in many 
places.

Hi Joe

CIBSE (UK) quotes HOF and, to my knowledge, doesn't use any other sources.

There's a lot of manufacturer data 'in the wild'. Perhaps this is an
opportunity to create such a resource as the WINDOW/ IGDB but for opaque
elements.

Message-ID: <495E30C5-7274-4872-BB68-D0A91A88659B@fc.ul.pt>

One day, free introductory course on natural ventilation simulation using EnergyPlus
Monday 10th of February 2014 ? 9am-4pm, Pacific Energy Center (PEC), 851 Howard Street, San Francisco
Wednesday 12th of February 2014 ? 8:30am-3:30pm, SCE Energy Education Center, 6090 N. Irwindale Ave., Irwindale
Thursday 13th of February 2014 ? 9am-4pm, SDG&E Energy Innovation Center (EIC), 4760 Clairemont Mesa Blvd, San Diego

In California, retrofitting buildings with natural ventilation offers the most potential for reducing energy costs and CO2 emissions associated with cooling. This one-day training session discusses how the new wind-driven natural ventilation modeling capabilities of EnergyPlus can be used to identify and quantify opportunities to implement natural ventilation in new and retrofit commercial building designs. EnergyPlus will be used to study questions such as how many operable windows are needed for a given space and what is the optimal arrangement for either cross ventilation or single-sided ventilation. Building geometry input and results visualization will be based on the recently released Simergy free EnergyPlus graphical interface.

Target audience
The target audiences for this course are design professionals (e.g., HVAC engineers, simulation consultants and architects with an interest in thermal simulation) as well as utility program managers.

Course structure
The course starts with a brief introduction to EnergyPlus and the Simergy interface, allowing for the participation of inexperienced users. The afternoon session introduces the new EnergyPlus natural ventilation modeling capabilities through a set of simple design exercises. The course will be taught by Spencer Dutton and Guilherme Gra?a. Spencer works in the Commercial Building Systems Group and the Simulation Research Group at LBNL. Guilherme is a building energy consultant that has carried out EnergyPlus modeling studies of the San Francisco Federal Office Building, the San Diego Children?s Museum, the New York Times HQ building among others.

What you need
Attendees must bring a laptop with Simergy and EnergyPlus 7.2 installed. For San Francisco please confirm attendance using the email (natventtrainingsf at natural-works.com<mailto:natventtrainingsf at natural-works.com>). For Irwindale and San Diego: online application (please see SCE and SDG&E websites).

Hey Christoph


A source that is slightly dated (1989) but still interesting to read is the report titled: ?The Harmonisation of Thermal Properties of Building Materials? by Joe Clarke and colleaques (www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Documents/89/thermop_rep.pdf?). The background was to collect data to extract information on the uncertainty of the material properties as input to uncertainty propagation studies. Another potential source might be the work of Prof. John Grunewald at the TU Dresden on modelling material properties (http://tu-dresden.de/bauklimatik).



Any chance that you expand on the work of Joe with regards to deriving and publishing uncertainty data on material properties?



Kind regards,



Christian

Betreff: [Bldg-sim] sources for material libraries

Dear colleagues,

We are currently assembling a material library as a basis for energy simulations and the question came up which source we should use to describe the various thermal and optical properties of  typical construction materials? A natural answer seems to be to use the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 2009 Chapter 26 which lists such numbers. Are these the tables that ?all? of you are using or am I missing an important resource? What about our Canadian, European and other international friends? Would you scorn at an ASHRAE library and rather use your own numbers? This data input is obviously tedious so we want to avoid having to do repeatedly.

All the best,

Christoph

All,

For ASHRAE 1199-RP some years ago (2003 - 2004 ish) I scrounged 
around looking for material properties.  Attached is a summary of 
what I came up with for some common materials.  As you can see, there 
is quite a range of opinion for some properties for some materials 
(including cases of different values from 2 different places in 
ASHRAE HOF).  I do not know the source(s) of those differences, in 
some cases there are probably regional differences and/or changes 
over time.  Or maybe just bad measurements.

Moisture content is another variable of which we are all becoming 
more aware.  Lab measurements vs. real-building situations.

Updated versions of some of these sources are probably available.

It would be an excellent project to build up a collection of this 
sort of info in some shared place, such as the IBPSA-USA Wiki 
(bembook.ibpsa.us).

Hey Christoph, OpenStudio has tried to address some of this issue in the online Building Component Library (BCL) at bcl.nrel.gov.  This database includes a variety of material and construction definitions used for energy simulation.  The components on BCL are organized into a taxonomy and include machine readable attributes to support searching.  The materials and constructions also come with premade IDF and OSM payloads so they can easily be included in EnergyPlus simulations.  Rob and I have talked several times about adding content for other simulation engines to (e.g. BSDFs for fenestration constructions to use in Radiance) but we haven't done this yet.  Components (and Measures) in the BCL can be made publically available or can be private to an individual user or group. Finally, the BCL has an API that software tools can use to automatically search, download, and upload components.  The OpenStudio API has methods for interacting with the BCL API, the OpenStudio applications use this to allow for searching and downloading measures and components directly in the OpenStudio GUIs.

Materials:
https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site?f[0]=im_field_component_tags%3A157<https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site?f%5b0%5d=im_field_component_tags%3A157>

Example Material (Brick):
https://bcl.nrel.gov/node/34420

Constructions:
https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site?f[0]=im_field_component_tags%3A127<https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/site?f%5b0%5d=im_field_component_tags%3A127>

Example Construction (189.1-2009 Nonres 1A Exterior Mass Wall):
https://bcl.nrel.gov/node/2930

BCL API:
https://bcl.nrel.gov/developer

The BCL doesn't really provide guidance on what constructions and materials to use, it is more about providing a common place to store these things and an API to make them accessible.  There is a rating system so users can vote for their favorite components.

Just let us know if you'd like to know any more,
Dan

Hello,

A project I'm building the energy model for is considering switching to electric heat. I understand that generally you would use the predominant HVAC system, so if the "predominant" system is electric, you would use System 8. See highlighted excerpt below.

My question to you is: what qualifies as "predominant"? Is there some percentage of energy consumption assigned to gas and electricity that signifies either as being dominant?

Thank you for the clarification.

The predominant condition is the one that serves the largest conditioned area.  This note is referring back to G3.1.1 exception a which allows the use of additional baseline system type(s) for non-predominant conditions if they are greater than 20k ft2.

In Argentina we have a local standard (IRAM 11601), which specify
material's hygrothermal properties. I attached the "envelope performance

A source that is slightly dated (1989) but still interesting to read is the report titled: ?The Harmonisation of Thermal Properties of Building Materials? by Joe Clarke and colleaques (www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Documents/89/thermop_rep.pdf<http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Documents/89/thermop_rep.pdf>).

Dear colleagues,

We are currently assembling a material library as a basis for energy simulations and the question came up which source we should use to describe the various thermal and optical properties of  typical construction materials? A natural answer seems to be to use the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 2009 Chapter 26 which lists such numbers. Are these the tables that ?all? of you are using or am I missing an important resource? What about our Canadian, European and other international friends? Would you scorn at an ASHRAE library and rather use your own numbers? This data input is obviously tedious so we want to avoid having to do repeatedly.

All the best,

Chip, others,

I was thinking along that line when I posted my comment on this topic last night.  What 
about proposing this as an activity to IBPSA World (?) where interested chapters in each 
country or region would compile their sources of material properties, and if there's 
sufficient interest, the properties themselves?  That would sure beat anyone in one place 
trying to compile data from the whole world, although some central coordination would be 
vital to make sure everyone is consistent in reporting their material properties.  I would 
also like to see that extended to commonly used calculation methods for heat transfer, 
such as for foundation heat flows, infiltration, and two-dimensional heat transfer. In my 
experience in China, every building energy code contains the same standard description of 
of how to derive equivalent U-factors for thermal bridging, which is a significant heat 
loss factor because 99% of the construction is heavy mass concrete, yet in the US only the 
real "nerds" ever bother with thermal bridging (even I don't! ).  I see many benefits from 
such an activity - (1) the local chapters would get clarity on what's different (or not) 
with the conditions in their country, (2) people working across national boundaries would 
be able to improve their modeling (I'm always bothered by people creating "ASHRAE-90" 
models for buildings in non-Western locations, as if all that differs is the climate), and 
(3) we might all learn something new and unexpected.

Hi all,

I'm trying to calculate what the loads will be for a space that includes
vegetation (no trees or anything big just green indoor planting). How would
I estimate the latent energy that these plants would require from my HVAC
design?

Are there any rules of thumb that people go by to estimate this, perhaps on
a W/m2?

Thanks for any advice,
Sebastian

Christoph,
I like using the ASHRAE Load Calculation Applications Manual.  It has a lot of the load calculation procedures and data in one easy to reference place.  Plus it's from 2008 so has been updated from research projects in the proceeding 10-20 years.  A lot of the building material thermal performance figures are taken directly from ASHRAE Handbook - Fundamentals though.

Dear colleagues,

We are currently assembling a material library as a basis for energy simulations and the question came up which source we should use to describe the various thermal and optical properties of  typical construction materials? A natural answer seems to be to use the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 2009 Chapter 26 which lists such numbers. Are these the tables that "all" of you are using or am I missing an important resource? What about our Canadian, European and other international friends? Would you scorn at an ASHRAE library and rather use your own numbers? This data input is obviously tedious so we want to avoid having to do repeatedly.

All the best,

Christoph

LBNL WINDOW / THERM integration might be a good model to follow in this
respect (though I think there are some issues with the relevance of igdb
data).

Like Joe, I don't tend to work out thermal bridging.

To expand on what Paul said, ISO 10456 is definitely the most relevant norm at the European level, but there are others that might be of use. Especially if you want to account for thermal bridges without using a heat transfer modeling software such as THERM: you could find a linear thermal bridge coefficient (Psi-value) in EN ISO 10211. Or you want to model ground heat transfer (ISO 13370).

European norms that are relevant to the question are the following (extracted from the French "energy code" (r?gles Th-U fascicule 4)) 

EN ISO 7345 - Thermal insulation - Physical quantities and definitions

EN ISO 13789 - Thermal performance of buildings -- Transmission and ventilation heat transfer coefficients -- Calculation method

EN ISO 10456 - Building materials and products -- Hygrothermal properties -- Tabulated design values and procedures for determining declared and design thermal values

EN ISO 6946 - Building components and building elements. Thermal resistance and thermal transmittance. Calculation method 

EN ISO 13370 - Thermal performance of buildings. Heat transfer via the ground. Calculation methods 

EN ISO 10211-1 - Thermal bridges in building construction -- Heat flows and surface temperatures -- Detailed calculations

EN ISO 10211-2 - Thermal bridges in building construction. Heat flows and surface temperatures ?- Linear thermal bridges

Hello Christopher,

I?ve done the MPE design work for 26 fire stations in Texas over the past 6 years.  In none of these is there any requirement for hot water serving the apparatus bay.  Fire engine washing is only done with cold water (a 2-inch line for both washing and tank filling.)  The only qualification is that all of these were in Texas.  Requirements may be different elsewhere.

Best regards,

P.S.  Hot water for domestic use is done as though it is a dormitory.

the various ISO standards for 2 and 3D thermal simulations have a decent material list with conductivities, etc.  For other, we generally use ASHRAE, etc.

Hello everyone,

Does anyone know of any published energy consumption data for museums? CBECS has a public assembly category, but I am hoping to get more specific data for museums. I understand that the numbers are going to be very diverse given the nature of a museum program but still hoping that there's something out there.

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <D30AFF4D10A0B64490B23B07B41010D41A72F0DA@EX2010-MBX3.ds.strath.ac.uk>


The grandfather report on material properties might just be the July 1990 report "The Harmonisation
of the Thermal Properties of Building Materials" by J A Clarke, P Yaneske and A Pinney
a Report for Project EM243 Construction Industry Directorate, Department of the
Environment.  Much of this then found its way into the CIBSE Guide. The report
looked at information from ~dozen sources.

I have recently been updating the ESP-r material databases with annotations from
this Report e.g. impermeables, non-hygroscopic, inorganic-porous etc.  as well
as the www reference for information sources of specific materials.

ESP-r also has some default values for linear thermal bridges (which can be assigned
to each surface-edge-join in the model) but tends to rely on users to supply information.

Regards, Jon Hand, ESRU, Glasgow

Especially if you want to account for thermal bridges without using a heat transfer modeling software such as THERM: you could find a linear thermal bridge coefficient (Psi-value) in EN ISO 10211.

Hi,

 

Centre for Advanced Research in Building Science and Energy (CARBSE) at CEPT
University has developed a wall and roof construction thermal transmittance
or thermal Conductance (U - Factor) calculator. Thermal properties of
materials used by the tool are derived by extensive characterization of
generic construction materials available in various parts of India. Majority
glass products available in India is also characterised, data of such glass
products are available in IGDB. Values have been derived by accredited lab

 

This is an online tool, to be accessed freely over internet. The values
derived by the tool are specific for the city. Thermal properties of
materials used by the tool are derived by extensive characterization of
generic construction materials available in various parts of India. 

 

The tool can be useful for selection of building material, construction, for
building energy modelling and analysis as well as for code compliance.

 

 <http://www.carbse.org/resource/tools/>
http://www.carbse.org/resource/tools/

 

For more information please contact us, we will be happy to extend database
of material as well. 

 

Currently, we are in process of characterising wall and window assemblies.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Data center modeling
Message-ID: <5FB5D3C0-4FF2-4AA0-8150-42D9E5D9F1DA@gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a question about data center modeling for leed.
According to leed version 4, we are required to model the baseline using appendix G and data center guidelines. Which book has these guidelines?

I am not sure where to find these guidelines to understand what does a data center guideline mean.

Does it relate more to operating temperature in data room and IT rack w/ft2?

Does the HVAC system used to model the baseline for data center is still based on the total square ft and number of storeys in the building.

Your reply is greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Amit

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Two water side systems
Message-ID: <002c01cf16c1$7eb4a1a0$7c1de4e0$@greenlivingprojects.com>

Hi everyone,

 

We are working on a model where two different water-side system will be used

for both cooling and heating.

 

One will be a geothermal heat pump that will cover base loads. The second

system will be an electrical heat pump that will be operates during peak

loads.

 

We tried to model the whole system but we found that it is not possible to

model a combination system for heating and cooling in eQuest.

 

Do you have any suggestion about modeling the above configuration?

 

Thank you in advance

That was a disappointment.  I was expecting to learn "how to develop 
complex energy models and effective modeling workflows, apply 
crowd-sourced model components and improvements, and analyze models to 
rapidly identify design and improvement opportunities, and more.."  I 
got none of that. What I got was a overview of the capabilities and a

members asked for specifics and demonstrations, a call screener said 
answers would be provided later.  The speaker spoke too fast and 
finished almost 30 minutes early.  There was plenty of time to do at 
least a simple demonstration.

I'm wondering if NREL chose the right people to provide OpenStudio 
training.  Based on their performance last Thursday, I'd say no.

I would agree with the assessment below. It was not at all what I was
expecting. Interesting if you are a software developer, but otherwise, not. 

 

I think that the presenter did not know who the intended audience was. Or
the presentation was not marketed properly, so that the right audience would
attend.

Message-ID: <FC1586506FC3D647A8CEAB83BA211A6938A72A2506@CH2MBX01.ch2.comcast.net>

Dear Forum,
I am modeling a supermarket which has made effort to install refrigerated casework that is more efficient than "normal" in three ways:
*             Casework lighting is LED instead of fluorescent
*             Evaporator fans use ECM motors and are demonstrably more efficient
*             The compressors have higher COP
I did not realize that claiming savings from a "process" load also requires substantiation of the Baseline energy for the process load via comparison to several similar facilities or a published paper.  I wish I knew that months ago!
We have data from three other supermarkets owned by the same company, but these other examples are not identical.  So far, all I can say is that:
a)            Manufacturer literature claims that LEDs used in their casework use ~ 65% less energy than fluorescent lights
b)            ECM fans use about 35% less energy in a manufacturer power comparison table
c)            The COP is better (I do not have detailed data yet)

This strikes me as a fairly weak argument, so I am asking you for suggestions or published data to strengthen the argument.

p.s., My last alternative is to ignore the process energy savings and make it the same for both models.  I think the savings are substantial, however, and would rather find a way to claim them!

Jim,

For the lights I would do a quick calculation of the Wattages of equal 
illumination lighting.  Whatever the case manufacturer would use in 
their BASELINE models.  I'm sure the LEDs are an upgrade, so just base 
the savings on the wattages and the hours of operation.  That one should 
be easy.

You could basically do the same thing with the COP.  As long as it is 
for the entire system, you can use a reasonable load and just multiply 
it out.  I'd try that anyway.  You might get shot down, but then you can 
always come back with different.

I'm not so sure about the ECM fans.  Where is the savings?  If they are 
variable speed, then there are some studies on variable speed fans 
versus constant speed fans, but they should be application specific / 
load profile specific.  I have seen ECM fan coil fans that save 
approximately nothing.

I believe that utilities give rebates and incentives for refrigeration 
upgrades like these.  Maybe the local utility does that.  Maybe PG&E 
does that.  If so, they may be able to steer you to a paper.


Good luck!

Hi Jim,

Just to clarify, are those open or closed refrigerated units? (Is there a
door?)

How many are we talking about? (kW or tons)

Are the compressors integrated within the unit (heat rejection within the
conditioned area) or do you have condensers outside? If you do, are you
also reusing waste heat to produce either hot water or heating?


When you say you have data from other stores but they are not identical,
what do you mean? Isn't there a unit that is similar (or exactly the same)
to those previously installed (reading your email I believe the
replacements have already been made in your studied building) where you
could strap a pulse meter for example for at least a couple of weeks?

Best,

The LEED for Retail New Construction and Major Renovations reference guide under EAc1 outlines a baseline refrigeration system.  We have used this for Austin Energy Green Build in the past.  It does a pretty good job but is a little vague on some of your issues.  The Energy Trust of Oregon has a version as well: http://energytrust.org/library/forms/NBE_PG_TechGuidelines.pdf.

Dear Forum,
I am modeling a supermarket which has made effort to install refrigerated casework that is more efficient than ?normal? in three ways:
?             Casework lighting is LED instead of fluorescent
?             Evaporator fans use ECM motors and are demonstrably more efficient
?             The compressors have higher COP
I did not realize that claiming savings from a ?process? load also requires substantiation of the Baseline energy for the process load via comparison to several similar facilities or a published paper.  I wish I knew that months ago!
We have data from three other supermarkets owned by the same company, but these other examples are not identical.  So far, all I can say is that:
a)            Manufacturer literature claims that LEDs used in their casework use ~ 65% less energy than fluorescent lights
b)            ECM fans use about 35% less energy in a manufacturer power comparison table
c)            The COP is better (I do not have detailed data yet)
 
This strikes me as a fairly weak argument, so I am asking you for suggestions or published data to strengthen the argument.
 
p.s., My last alternative is to ignore the process energy savings and make it the same for both models.  I think the savings are substantial, however, and would rather find a way to claim them!

Julien,

?         There is a mix of open and closed cases

?         Compressors are external to the cases and condenser is outdoors

?         Waste heat is being captured from one of the systems

?         The other stores have a different mix of cases and it is not practical to measure comparable portions

Hi Jim,

Just to clarify, are those open or closed refrigerated units? (Is there a door?)

How many are we talking about? (kW or tons)

Are the compressors integrated within the unit (heat rejection within the conditioned area) or do you have condensers outside? If you do, are you also reusing waste heat to produce either hot water or heating?

When you say you have data from other stores but they are not identical, what do you mean? Isn't there a unit that is similar (or exactly the same) to those previously installed (reading your email I believe the replacements have already been made in your studied building) where you could strap a pulse meter for example for at least a couple of weeks?
Best,

The LEED for Retail New Construction and Major Renovations reference guide under EAc1 outlines a baseline refrigeration system.  We have used this for Austin Energy Green Build in the past.  It does a pretty good job but is a little vague on some of your issues.  The Energy Trust of Oregon has a version as well: http://energytrust.org/library/forms/NBE_PG_TechGuidelines.pdf.

Jim,

The 2013 version of ASHRAE Standard 90.1 added requirements for refrigerated casework. I suggest you identify where your project exceeds those requirements and make the case to USGBC that what is in 90.1 should be the baseline. Good luck.

Jim,

There is a similar baseline description of commercial refrigeration systems in Alliant Energy?s Technical Guide Book 2012. Start on page 124 of  http://www.alliantenergy.com/wcm/groups/wcm_internet/@int/documents/document/mdaw/mdiz/~edisp/023759.pdf.
Info for anti-condensate door heater controls starts on page 119.
Info for LED lighting in refrigeration cases starts on page 48.

The State of Illinois also publishes deemed savings values for various upgrades in their Technical Reference Manual (TRM). See Section 4.6 for refrigeration. http://www.ilsag.info/il_trm_version_2.html

ComEd incentives for refrigeration upgrades are listed in https://www.comed.com/Documents/business-savings/SIFYB_PY6_Refrigeration.pdf.

Some of the measures in the above references are specifically for upgrading existing equipment, not new construction, so read the fine print carefully.

I hope this helps!

I  am starting to think GBCI doesn't have a chance (to disagree), but I will have to read these references first :).

Jim,

There is a similar baseline description of commercial refrigeration systems in Alliant Energy?s Technical Guide Book 2012. Start on page 124 of  http://www.alliantenergy.com/wcm/groups/wcm_internet/@int/documents/document/mdaw/mdiz/~edisp/023759.pdf.
Info for anti-condensate door heater controls starts on page 119.
Info for LED lighting in refrigeration cases starts on page 48.

The State of Illinois also publishes deemed savings values for various upgrades in their Technical Reference Manual (TRM). See Section 4.6 for refrigeration. http://www.ilsag.info/il_trm_version_2.html

ComEd incentives for refrigeration upgrades are listed in https://www.comed.com/Documents/business-savings/SIFYB_PY6_Refrigeration.pdf.

Some of the measures in the above references are specifically for upgrading existing equipment, not new construction, so read the fine print carefully.

I hope this helps!

Sincerely,

The LEED for Retail New Construction and Major Renovations reference guide under EAc1 outlines a baseline refrigeration system.  We have used this for Austin Energy Green Build in the past.  It does a pretty good job but is a little vague on some of your issues.  The Energy Trust of Oregon has a version as well: http://energytrust.org/library/forms/NBE_PG_TechGuidelines.pdf.

Dear Forum,
I am modeling a supermarket which has made effort to install refrigerated casework that is more efficient than ?normal? in three ways:
?             Casework lighting is LED instead of fluorescent
?             Evaporator fans use ECM motors and are demonstrably more efficient
?             The compressors have higher COP
I did not realize that claiming savings from a ?process? load also requires substantiation of the Baseline energy for the process load via comparison to several similar facilities or a published paper.  I wish I knew that months ago!
We have data from three other supermarkets owned by the same company, but these other examples are not identical.  So far, all I can say is that:
a)            Manufacturer literature claims that LEDs used in their casework use ~ 65% less energy than fluorescent lights
b)            ECM fans use about 35% less energy in a manufacturer power comparison table
c)            The COP is better (I do not have detailed data yet)

This strikes me as a fairly weak argument, so I am asking you for suggestions or published data to strengthen the argument.

p.s., My last alternative is to ignore the process energy savings and make it the same for both models.  I think the savings are substantial, however, and would rather find a way to claim them!

Jim,

The 2013 version of ASHRAE Standard 90.1 added requirements for refrigerated casework. I suggest you identify where your project exceeds those requirements and make the case to USGBC that what is in 90.1 should be the baseline. Good luck.

Jim,
I have not modeled casework in a while but I recall the frustration over defining the baseline and claiming savings.  The LEED 2009 for Retail rating system literature addressed several of these parameters and maybe version 4 does too. When available, it is best to cite their own literature back to them.
Good luck,

Message-ID: <CAOKTROYS4H-fY9T0BvF1jrt8nsH-KHs6jMUncOqg7_q3cV8TEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to model a DOAS system in EE4: the building is a high rise
building where OA is supplied to the rooms via corridors. This air is
tempered before supplying it to the corridors.

How would I set this up in EE4?

Thanks for any help,
Sebastian

Subject: [Bldg-sim] displacement ventilation with low ceiling height
Message-ID: <20140127170106.GC19973@eryd-W150HRM>

Folks,

Some innocent (read: ignorant) questions about DV:
What if a displacement ventilation system is applied to spaces with 
low ceiling height:

1. Is there any negative consequence? I know that the benefits of DV 
will not be achieved. But I see this as a missed opportunity, not a 
negative consequence.

2. What will the air distribution be? Will it change into a mixed 
ventilation? This is related to the above question. If the only 
consequence of DV with low ceiling height is that it will be switched 
back to a mixed ventilation, then there is really no negative effect 
of using DV with low ceiling height.

3. Or may be there a cost consideration in this? is DV generally more 
expensive than mixed air system?

4. Can the above questions be answered with EnergyPlus's DV model?

Any pointers to previous studies on this will be greately appreciated?

Thanks,

Ery

Dear all,

ASHRAE 90.1 - 2007, App G
typical office building
Climate zone 4a

A mixing box should operate predominantly on re-circ whilst introducing a
minimal amount of fresh air to the building (such as that required to meet
ASHRAE 62.1).

Does anybody else find the tables G3.1.2.6A & B confusing?

Cheers

Chris

Sorry this was a question! I was just trying to be concise but realised
when I re-read that it was incomplete.

It appears that an economizer is not applicable to a baseline building in
this case. However, G.3.1.2.6B infers that there may still be a high limit
shutoff.

I thought the high limit shutoff was the economizer!

Grateful for your longsuffering patience!

Dear Chris,
4a does not appear to be referenced in Table 6B...
Regardless, the two tables go together and a high limit is not applicable if no economizer is used.
p.s., I don't recall, but I think my red marks reflect some addenda.

Descriptions

Presentation 1

Title: Data Mining: Get More Out of your Energy Models

Shreshth Nagpal, Associate, Atelier Ten

The presenters will talk about data discovery as a specific subset of data
visualization. In particular about utilizing interactive graphics that
provide a better way to query, filter and sort data; as analysis tools that
find and express relationships between a multitude of design parameters.

About the Speaker: With over a decade of experience in the field of
high-performance building design, Shreshth is an expert in the application
of building performance simulation and analysis for architectural design
and systems optimization. A key member of the Atelier Ten Energy Analysis
practice, he brings to the team his experience in building energy analysis
including renewable energy systems and optimization of high-performance
building envelope, mechanical, and electrical systems.

A proposed building will only use H&V for a warehouse type space.

Is it possible to use the normal HVAC baseline system (mapped to be system 11, 'packaged RTU) and then ONLY H&V for proposed?

Thank you

Michelle,

 

In case you didn't get an answer to your question yesterday afternoon.

 

Sounds like you are looking at the system types in Section 11 (ECB method),
but for LEED projects, the appendix G modeling protocol must be used
(Performance Rating Method). As for the H&V only warehouse, you should look
at Addendum dn to 90.1-2007 which establishes H&V baseline systems and
provides some guidance. Alternatively, you can look in 90.1-2010 Appendix G.

 

Hope this helps.
