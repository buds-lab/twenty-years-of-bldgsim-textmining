James,

My understanding is that the baseline model becomes a bit of a mix for existing buildings (and no, 90.1 2007 doesn't clarify much).  The basic rule I've followed is this: any part of the building that will be touched by the new design should be modeled in the baseline per ASHRAE 90.1.  In other words, there's an implicit assumption that the existing building is below the current ASHRAE minimum, and the minimum improvement for the proposed design would be to bring it up to the standard.  LEED credit is earned only by exceeding this minimum improvement.

I would therefore answer your two questions as follows:

1) Are the HVAC, thermal parameters, and lighting being touched by the proposed design?  If so, then model them in the baseline per 90.1.  If not, then baseline = proposed = existing conditions.  

The problem with the methodology above arises when existing conditions currently exceed ASHRAE minimums.  If this is the case, I would either review the LEED CIR archives for advice, or I would model the existing condition in the baseline and include a narrative with the submission explaining that the existing condition already exceeded the ASHRAE minimum.  I admit I have not encountered this before, but I believe EA Credit 1's intent is best served by maximizing the baseline performance.          

2) Model the baseline with windows on that facade, percent matching the proposed design if it's under 40%, but obviously keep the baseline window performance as specified in 90.1.

I would appreciate anyone with differing advice to sound off; I'm working on similar projects that would be affected, and I've had to change my interpretation in the past.  Thanks,

Dakota

Bill-

I have worked on alot of university projects that have their own central
plants and from my experience the price of chilled water and hot water will
vary from university to university---especially if schools are using co- or
tri-gen central plants.  You should ask the client to provide you with the

Hello,

 

I asked a question a few weeks ago about whether or not you have to rotate the Baseline building in a LEED-NC EAc1 calculation (or Appendix G calculation for some other reason).  Thank you everyone for your replies (see below)...it appears that yes, you do need to perform the four (4) separate runs for each direction.

 

However, I have a more general question about modeling renovations to existing buildings.  According to the LEED-NC reference guide, you are to model the Baseline building (if it is existing) with the same "thermal parameters" as the existing building.  Appendix G, Table G3.1 Section 5f) says that "For Existing building envelopes, the baseline building design shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions that are part of the scope of work...".  

 

Futhermore, the reference guide goes on to say that "For projects served by existing HVAC systems, such as a central plant on a campus, Section 10(a) of Table G3.1 states that when there is an existing HVAC system, the model shall reflect the actual system type using actual component capacities and efficiencies."

 

But this section is actually under the "Proposed" column, and I can't find anywhere where it specifically says that the Baseline system should be modeled as the existing building currently stands.

 

So I have two questions:

 

1)       If you have an existing building, is the HVAC system supposed to be modeled as it currently exists in the Baseline model, as well as things like the thermal parameters, etc?  What about the lighting?  If you have an existing building that you KNOW has a lighting density of 2.0 Watts / sq ft pre-retrofit, is that how you should model the Baseline building?

 

2)      If I have an existing building that happens to have one exposure with NO windows, and part of the renovation is to install windows on that side of the building, while STILL BEING BELOW 40% total window area.  How do I model the baseline building?  With windows there or not?  If not, then that is a major penalty, and in reality, I may want to compare my Proposed building to a Baseline model that is 90.1-2004 compliant.  Can you even do that if it is an existing building?  Can you choose whether to model the Baseline building it as it exists, or model it per minimum ASHRAE standards?  

 

I haven't yet received a copy of 90.1-2007.  Does Appendix G in that version clarify any of this?  

 

Thanks in advance!

Kevin,

I have since reversed my stance; Eric O'Neill was kind enough to provide
me with the following link:

http://lists.onebuilding.org/htdig.cgi/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2007-Nov
ember/005709.html

I had not come across this thread before, and it sounds like existing
buildings need to be rotated regardless of the situation.

James,

It is my understanding that it is not necessary to do the rotation on an
existing building.  I am also working on an existing building, and I
plan to submit without rotating.  This topic has been debated on the
forum in the past with opposing opinions, each side having reasonable
arguments, but if my memory is correct the best/last argument was that
existing buildings do not need to be rotated.  I think this position
makes more intuitive sense, too.

I don't believe a definitive resource exists for this question, which is
why I plan to "learn the hard way" on my project.  I have heard that
2009 LEED revisions will address questions specific to existing
buildings; hopefully this will be one of them.  In the interim, I would
ask that anyone with a differing opinion specify the resource guiding
them.

I'm working on a project where I am pursuing LEED EAc1 for an existing
building.  As I understand it from the LEED-NC reference guide, as well
as from some snippets of 90.1, I actually model the baseline building as
is currently exists.  The reference guide says:

"For existing buildings that are being renovated, the building envelope
design parameters for the Baseline Design should be modeled using the
existing (pre-retrofit) building envelope thermal parameters rather than
the ASHRAE 90.1 prescriptive building envelope requirements for the
specified climate."

So I'm using actual window areas, actual insulation values, etc.

My question is:  if I'm using this exception, do I also no longer have
to do a simulation at the four different azimuth required by the LEED
EAc1 template?

I find 90.1, as well as the user's manual, fairly lacking in describing
how to apply Appendix G to existing buildings in general....

Thanks in advance!

I am modeling a new building applying for LEED certification and want to make sure I'm using the right Appendix G baseline HVAC system configuration. The proposed design has three gas/electric rooftop packaged HVAC units, each with VVT dampers for subzoning, 6 to 12 subzones per system, all zones are defined at the stage of design development we're at. I believe I need Appendix G system type 3, gas/electric single zone units for my baseline, but do I use the same three HVAC unit configuration and assign the same eQUEST spaces/zones to the corresponding systems, or do I use a separate HVAC system for each space/zone? Thanks in advance for any replies.

Dakota,
 
I am in the process of modeling and submitting a couple of projects under
LEED Core and Shell. However, I'm not far enough along to have had any
reviews done yet. I have seen in both the LEED CS-2.0 and LEED NC-2.2
reference guides where existing buildings are addressed in EAc1 credit
Calculations. Both RGs state: "For existing buildings that are being
renovated, the building envelope design parameters for the Baseline Design
should be modeled using the existing (pre-retrofit) building envelope
thermal parameters rather than the ASHRAE Std. 90.1 prescriptive building
envelope requirements for the specified climate. Any proposed changes to the
building envelope (such as replacing windows or increasing roof insulation)
should be modeled in the Proposed Design".

Hello,
 
 
 
I asked a question a few weeks ago about whether or not you have to rotate
the Baseline building in a LEED-NC EAc1 calculation (or Appendix G
calculation for some other reason).  Thank you everyone for your replies
(see below)...it appears that yes, you do need to perform the four (4)
separate runs for each direction.
 
 
 
However, I have a more general question about modeling renovations to
existing buildings.  According to the LEED-NC reference guide, you are to
model the Baseline building (if it is existing) with the same "thermal
parameters" as the existing building.  Appendix G, Table G3.1 Section 5f)
says that "For Existing building envelopes, the baseline building design
shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions that are part of
the scope of work...".  
 
 
 
Futhermore, the reference guide goes on to say that "For projects served by
existing HVAC systems, such as a central plant on a campus, Section 10(a) of
Table G3.1 states that when there is an existing HVAC system, the model
shall reflect the actual system type using actual component capacities and
efficiencies."
 
 
 
But this section is actually under the "Proposed" column, and I can't find
anywhere where it specifically says that the Baseline system should be
modeled as the existing building currently stands.
 
 
 
So I have two questions:
 
 
 
1)       If you have an existing building, is the HVAC system supposed to be
modeled as it currently exists in the Baseline model, as well as things like
the thermal parameters, etc?  What about the lighting?  If you have an
existing building that you KNOW has a lighting density of 2.0 Watts / sq ft
pre-retrofit, is that how you should model the Baseline building?
 
 
 
2)      If I have an existing building that happens to have one exposure
with NO windows, and part of the renovation is to install windows on that
side of the building, while STILL BEING BELOW 40% total window area.  How do
I model the baseline building?  With windows there or not?  If not, then
that is a major penalty, and in reality, I may want to compare my Proposed
building to a Baseline model that is 90.1-2004 compliant.  Can you even do
that if it is an existing building?  Can you choose whether to model the
Baseline building it as it exists, or model it per minimum ASHRAE standards?

 
 
 
I haven't yet received a copy of 90.1-2007.  Does Appendix G in that version
clarify any of this?  
 
 
 
Thanks in advance!

It is my understanding that it is not necessary to do the rotation on an

plan to submit without rotating.  This topic has been debated on the
forum in the past with opposing opinions, each side having reasonable

I'm working on a project where I am pursuing LEED EAc1 for an existing
building.  As I understand it from the LEED-NC reference guide, as well
as from some snippets of 90.1, I actually model the baseline building as
is currently exists.  The reference guide says:
 
"For existing buildings that are being renovated, the building envelope
design parameters for the Baseline Design should be modeled using the
existing (pre-retrofit) building envelope thermal parameters rather than
the ASHRAE 90.1 prescriptive building envelope requirements for the
specified climate."
 
So I'm using actual window areas, actual insulation values, etc.
 
My question is:  if I'm using this exception, do I also no longer have
to do a simulation at the four different azimuth required by the LEED
EAc1 template?
 
I find 90.1, as well as the user's manual, fairly lacking in describing
how to apply Appendix G to existing buildings in general....
 
Thanks in advance!

Dear Mr. Rick Routh,

You will have to assign one system type 3 to every zone in your building.

System type 3, as you point out, are single zone units, meaning they can
only respond to one thermostat input. However, in ASHRAE 90.1 User's Manual,
2004 on page G-23 they say that "the baseline building HVAC system is a
rooftop packaged system serving each thermal zone (or thermal block)." This
allows you to group similar zones in your proposed building together, and
you can assign your System type 3 to each block instead, speeding up the
calculations for your model. However, your thermal blocks must be specified
identically in your proposed and baseline building. Example G-H on page G-27
in the same User's Manual highlights this point.

For information on thermal blocks and how they are modeled in your proposed
building, refer to ASHRAE 90.1 (the standard, not the user's manual), p 173,
table G3.1 - 7.

I hope this clarifies your question, if not, feel free to contact me.

Sincerely yours,

In the baseline model, match existing conditions only with the envelope and only where alterations or additions were not applied.

Dakota,



I am in the process of modeling and submitting a couple of projects under LEED Core and Shell. However, I'm not far enough along to have had any reviews done yet. I have seen in both the LEED CS-2.0 and LEED NC-2.2 reference guides where existing buildings are addressed in EAc1 credit Calculations. Both RGs state: "For existing buildings that are being renovated, the building envelope design parameters for the Baseline Design should be modeled using the existing (pre-retrofit) building envelope thermal parameters rather than the ASHRAE Std. 90.1 prescriptive building envelope requirements for the specified climate. Any proposed changes to the building envelope (such as replacing windows or increasing roof insulation) should be modeled in the Proposed Design".



Best of Luck,

Subject: RE: Modeling existing buildings per LEED EAc1 / App G



James,



My understanding is that the baseline model becomes a bit of a mix for existing buildings (and no, 90.1 2007 doesn't clarify much).  The basic rule I've followed is this: any part of the building that will be touched by the new design should be modeled in the baseline per ASHRAE 90.1.  In other words, there's an implicit assumption that the existing building is below the current ASHRAE minimum, and the minimum improvement for the proposed design would be to bring it up to the standard.  LEED credit is earned only by exceeding this minimum improvement.



I would therefore answer your two questions as follows:



1) Are the HVAC, thermal parameters, and lighting being touched by the proposed design?  If so, then model them in the baseline per 90.1.  If not, then baseline = proposed = existing conditions.



The problem with the methodology above arises when existing conditions currently exceed ASHRAE minimums.  If this is the case, I would either review the LEED CIR archives for advice, or I would model the existing condition in the baseline and include a narrative with the submission explaining that the existing condition already exceeded the ASHRAE minimum.  I admit I have not encountered this before, but I believe EA Credit 1's intent is best served by maximizing the baseline performance.



2) Model the baseline with windows on that facade, percent matching the proposed design if it's under 40%, but obviously keep the baseline window performance as specified in 90.1.



I would appreciate anyone with differing advice to sound off; I'm working on similar projects that would be affected, and I've had to change my interpretation in the past.  Thanks,



Dakota

existing (pre-retrofit) building envelope thermal parameters rather than

the ASHRAE 90.1 prescriptive building envelope requirements for the

specified climate."



So I'm using actual window areas, actual insulation values, etc.



My question is:  if I'm using this exception, do I also no longer have

to do a simulation at the four different azimuth required by the LEED

EAc1 template?



I find 90.1, as well as the user's manual, fairly lacking in describing

how to apply Appendix G to existing buildings in general....



Thanks in advance!

I can't seem to find reference to this in the 90.1 User Manual.  

 

In Appendix G, Table G3.1.1A, there is a reference to a Fossil/Electric
hybrid for determining Baseline system type.  Is this a system that, for
example, might have a gas-fired RTU with electric VAV boxes? 

 

In other words, if there is ANY gas heat in your Proposed building, your
Baseline building would have to automatically default to a fuel furnace
or gas-fired hot water heating system, correct?

 

Thanks,

There is a CIR floating out there from a LEED-CS project that states the
baseline building can have electric reheat. However, the modeler is to
match the total therms of natural gas consumed for the gas-fired RTU in
both the baseline and as-designed models.

Yes, you are correct. Appendix G requires that if you have any gas heat
in your Proposed building, the baseline system would use gas heat.
However, if this is for a LEED submittal, you may want to do a little
research on relevant CIR's since USGBC has interpreted this a little
differently than was intended by Appendix G.

I believe the/a CIR that Mr. Rosenberg is referring to is an NC v 2.2 CIR submitted 9/27/06 and answered on 10/23/06 that hinges on the gas being preheat.

I have not read the CIR Mr. Dec mentioned although that seems fascinating too.

Paul, you are correct, the NC CIR appears to apply.  I couldn't find one
under CS.  And yes, it looks like as long as the gas heating section is
for preheat (or after-hours heating, or morning warm-up, etc) then you
can have a gas-fired RTU with electric reheat VAV boxes.

 

Thanks to all,

Hello,

 

Can anyone tell me what the "Years of Previous Operation" field does
under GSHP? Does this take into account the annual imbalance in heating
and cooling load to determine how the ground properties change from year
to year?

 

Thanks,

Dear bldg members,

I?m trying to execute a simulation approach on a swimming pool simulation
using EnergyPlus. I decided to write  hoping you could give me some guidance
help on this kind of simulation approach since Energyplus does not have a
model for it.

The objective would be to simulate the pool environment, accounting for all
the heat transfer phenomenons, heat losses, etc., but more important the
evaporation losses which must be treated with dehumidification equipment.
The space must be heated and dehumidified using a standard dehumidifier
equipment.

Defining the space and boundary conditions is not difficult using the
current geometry interfaces. At the end I would like to obtain the energy
consumption of HVAC equipment on treating the space loads (mainly
dehumidification and heating).

Can you give me some guidance help on what have you done in your approach on
EnergyPlus? Is there any other software or application which is capable of
simulating this kind of model?

Thanks in advance,
Nuno

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Radiance: Determining Specularity Values - Spandrel
	Panels: Marble vs Fritted Glass
Message-ID: <3EC944427F87D84793DBBC4137A2B5AD4CD833@to1exc02wp.halsall.com>

Hello All,

 

I am trying to compare the difference in glare given off a building
after a cladding retrofit (from the perspective of occupants in
neighboring buildings). The original curtain wall cladding is a
white/grey marble and glass spandrel panels with a white patterned frit
are proposed for the retrofit. I am using Radiance in IES' Virtual
Environment program; this is my first time using the simulation
software. 

 

I have some questions about determining/selecting material properties,
specifically deciding what material type (plastic/metal) and secularity
to use for the two cladding options. 

 

Specifically how do I choose a realistic secularity value for the
material I am using? Is there a definitive way to select a value or is
it dependant on multiple iterations comparing how the images produced
look? I'm trying to use the program to show me how much glare I could
expect to see, if the results are based on constantly tweaking the
parameters so the image "looks" right for me I don't see how the results
can be accurate. 

 

Is a more extensive database of materials and their properties (beyond
what is provided with the program) available? For the materials
described below what specularity values would you recommend - and what
is the basis behind choosing those values? 

 

 

My assumptions:

 

Marble - Originally white, but panels have become grey with dirt over
time, not polished, dull finish

Type:                Plastic

Colour:             (0.91, 0.91, 0.83) 

Specularity:       ?????? (I think this may be low because it is not
polished marble)

Roughness:      0.05 (???) 

 

 

 

Glass Frit - Composed of: Clear glass, 60% coverage white frit, clear
glass, 100% coverage white frit. From Window 6, I estimate the solar
reflectance of the system to be around 25-35%. 

 

Typle:               Metal ??? (Does the frit have specular and diffuse
reflection of light?)

Colour:             (1.0,1.0, 1.0)

Specularity:       ????? (Clean polished glass)

Roughness:      0.00

 

 

If anyone has information from doing a similar simulation or has any
suggestion on what specularity values I should use to model these
materials it would be very much appreciated.

 

 

Thanks, 

 

Nastassja

Hi Nuno,
I have not used Energyplus before. But I guess you would have to do a hand calculation to determine the evaporation rate and model it as a latent load. You could input that latent load as a plug load or even add to people latent load. I know that there is some ASHRAE journal/article which talks about how to calculate the evaporation rate in swimming pools. But unfortunately, I am not able to point you were to download that article. I am sure you can find it if you do some Google search. Hope this helps!
If you end up modeling in a different way, please let me know. I would be interested to know.
Regards,
Yuvaraj

Nuno,

I have used the IndoorPoolCalc.xls spreadsheet tool for analyzing indoor
pool heating and dehumidification energy.

It is available here:
http://www.energyideas.org/documents/spreadsheets/IndoorPoolCalc.xls

It can be used to find energy savings resulting from using a pool cover,
changing air/water temperature and humidity setpoints, new boiler, new
dehumidifier and so on.  It is based on the Shah Method--see "Calculating
Evaporation from Indoor Water Pools", HPAC Engineering, March 2004.

I hope this helps,

I am modeling a building with packaged gas/electric rooftop units with Carrier System 3 (previously Parker) zone dampers and bypass. I am getting a huge number of hours with loads not met and I'm thinking it's due to the model using just the one control zone to determine the operating mode of the unit, instead of the combination of "majority rules" and "zone of greatest demand" logic the actual system uses. Does anyone have a method of better simulating the actual equipment operation which accounts for the system's ability to reverse modes if some zones, in my case other than the specified control zone, are calling for the opposite? Is the ceiling bypass VAV model more similar to this actual system? I'm thinking maybe not as it resets leaving air temperature only on zone of greatest cooling demand. I'm confident the system design will maintain comfort conditions in the various zones even if the unit has to reverse modes occasionally, but the modeling is for LEED which restricts how many unmet load hours you can have. All thoughts and experience on this subject would be appreciated, and thanks for your replies to my other recent messages.

There was also substantial work done in the 1980s by Francis DeWinter at the Atlas Corporation, that included explicite algorithms for modeling the combined heat loss.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Swimming Pool Modelling

 

Dear bldg members,

I?m trying to execute a simulation approach on a swimming pool simulation using EnergyPlus. I decided to write  hoping you could give me some guidance help on this kind of simulation approach since Energyplus does not have a model for it.

The objective would be to simulate the pool environment, accounting for all the heat transfer phenomenons, heat losses, etc., but more important the evaporation losses which must be treated with dehumidification equipment. The space must be heated and dehumidified using a standard dehumidifier equipment.

Defining the space and boundary conditions is not difficult using the current geometry interfaces. At the end I would like to obtain the energy consumption of HVAC equipment on treating the space loads (mainly dehumidification and heating).

Can you give me some guidance help on what have you done in your approach on EnergyPlus? Is there any other software or application which is capable of simulating this kind of model?

Thanks in advance,
Nuno

baseline model and adjust the proposed design model to meet specific
requirements like process energy amount...

Can someone please provide input regarding what would be the correct Appendix G baseline system for a 4 storied building > 150,000 sf which has a chilled water system for cooling and uses electric series fan powered boxes for perimeter heating. There is a gas fired dedicated outside air unit that supplies air to all the Air handling Units. The gas fired OA units use about 35% of the total heating energy for the building. The rest 65% is from the perimeter boxes. The total heating utility cost for gas is very small ($6500) compared to the total building utility cost ($270,500).

We intend to submit this project for LEED and are struggling since the choice of the base system significantly changes the performance of the building. We have implemented a number of energy saving measures in the design like better insulation in walls and roof, high performance glass, daylight sensors, occupancy controls, reduced lighting power density, heat recovery, water side economizer. Our building saves about 15%energy compared to the baseline system when using System 7 as the baseline. However in terms of Utility this imposes a major penalty and barely meets the baseline Utility Cost when compared to a hydronic system i.e., System 7.
When the baseline is modeled as System 8 we can the 14% Utility Cost savings.

Has someone modeled a system similar to this before and submitted it for LEED. What would be the correct choice for the baseline system.
There is note on page 176 which states" Where attributes make a building eligible for more than one building system type, use the predominant condition to determine the system type for the entire building. "

We think this exception would apply to our design since most of our heating is electric and System 8 would be the right system to use.

One option around this is to change our Outside air units as electric and then there would be no question regarding the base system as it would be electric System 8. However we do not think this is the right design approach since the proposed design would have more utility cost than the current scenario and meet LEED 14% requirements.

There was a discussion regarding this a few days back on the forum and there was a mention of a CIR dated 9/27/2006. Would this apply to our case?

I know there are a number of experienced professionals on this forum who have been involved with the LEED energy and atmosphere credits documentation evaluation for different LEED projects for this credit. I would appreciate your insight.

Please advise.

Thanks

Yes, you are correct. Appendix G requires that if you have any gas heat in your Proposed building, the baseline system would use gas heat. However, if this is for a LEED submittal, you may want to do a little research on relevant CIR's since USGBC has interpreted this a little differently than was intended by Appendix G.

I can't seem to find reference to this in the 90.1 User Manual.

In Appendix G, Table G3.1.1A, there is a reference to a Fossil/Electric hybrid for determining Baseline system type.  Is this a system that, for example, might have a gas-fired RTU with electric VAV boxes?

In other words, if there is ANY gas heat in your Proposed building, your Baseline building would have to automatically default to a fuel furnace or gas-fired hot water heating system, correct?

Does this estimate include LEED templates and supporting documentation?  Perhaps budget 12-20 hours depending on system complexity.

Don't forget review comments.

And the baseline EIR should include the wattage calc'd from G.3.1.2.9?

Backing up for a moment, there is a funny way to determine the oversizing capacities, especially for PSZs.  Here goes:

Run the design model with design capacity, run the design model autosized, find the ratio.
Run the baseline model autosized, apply the ratio.  Now oversize for 15% cooling and 25% for heating.

Does anybody do this differently, because the fine print doesn't exactly say that much.

OK, I read it again.  Autosize the baseline and run four orientations to obtain the capacities (assuming an average of the four).  These capacities will be oversized.  I understand.  Thank you.

Message-ID: <531759080811061633t3417bbf0t6474226968acb18f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all;

I'm trying to figure out how to manually enter geometry in DOE-2.2 and I'm
having a little bit of trouble. My problems are myriad, but they essentially
boil down to this: when I enter

polygon.0 = POLYGON
  V1 = (0.0,0.0)
  V2 = (200,0)
  V3 = (200,300)
  V4 = (0,300)
  ..

floor.0 = FLOOR
  AZIMUTH = 360
  POLYGON = polygon.0
  SHAPE = POLYGON
  FLOOR-HEIGHT = 3.28
  SPACE-HEIGHT = 3.28
  ..

space.0 = SPACE
  ZONE-TYPE = UNCONDITIONED
  POLYGON = polygon.0
  SHAPE = POLYGON
  ..

face.0 = EXTERIOR-WALL
  POLYGON = polygon.0
  X = 0
  Y = 0
  Z = 0.0
  AZIMUTH = 0.0
  TILT = 0.0
  CONSTRUCTION = "EWall Construction"
  ..

and import it to eQuest (the only good way I can think of to check if I've
entered my geometry correctly), the resulting EXTERIOR-WALL surface is not
where I expect it to be. I was expecting it to be in "NE" quadrant of the
the building's XY plane, but instead it's in the "SW" quadrant, as if it had
been rotated 180 degrees about the building coordinate system's z-axis.
Puzzlingly, the SPACE and FLOOR objects appear where I would expect them to
-- in the building's "NE" quadrant.

Clearly I'm misunderstanding something about how POLYGON objects are to be
positioned. If anyone could help me to understand what I've got wrong, I
would greatly appreciate it.

Many thanks,

Josh

Suggest reverse engineering...define your objective in eQuest (starting with
the lower-leftmost vertex for all polygons) and compare the resulting inp
file to yours.  Also take a close look at the DOE2.2 documentation, wherein
the coordinate system is detailed.

Suspected root cause issue is the disconnect going from the eQuest
Floor/Zone editor, where all zone (space) coordinates are entered absolute,
to the .inp file where the eQuest stores coordinates of space polygons
relative to the floor polygon.

Suggest always starting all polygons with the lower-leftmost vertex, to help
make sense of the relative coordinates and azimuths.  This habit is one
you'll be glad to have acquired, should dissecting inp files become your
muse.

Message-ID: <83996EE70003D04B830E1C4A5E6688CE7CE082@PATHMAIL2.pathfinderengineers.com>

The mechanical engineer for a campus laboratory building with 100% OA
wants to claim energy savings for reduced exhaust from more efficient
fume hoods. (Established design practice uses hoods with 100 fpm flow -
they are installing 70 fpm hoods. This reduces peak exhaust from 700 to
490 CFM per hood.) My approach has always been to keep outside air,
exhaust and infiltration flows identical between the proposed and
baseline models (except for DCV). (This was not easy for this model with
proposed VAV and baseline constant volume packaged rooftops.)

 

Has anybody successfully claimed OA/exhaust/infiltration savings for a
LEED project?

 

Thanks,

Bill

Why is there a direct conflict in the required Baseline system type between the App G chart in 90.1 and the wording in the 90.1 user manual?
 
I have a 6-story building that is 100,000 sq ft.  If I read Table G3.1.1A of 90.1, it says:
 
"Nonresidential & More than 5 floors OR > 150,000 sq ft", that I should use System 8 (VAV with PFP boxes).
 
Even Table G-A in the User Manual says the same thing.
 
In addition, the requirements for using System 6 say:
 
"Non residential, 4 or 5 floors or less than 75,000 sq ft OR 5 floors or less and 75,000 - 150,000 sq ft".
 
Both of these facts would lead me to believe that anything over 5 stories should be System 8.  However, the wording in the User Manual goes on to say that:
 
"For intermediate-sized buildings that are 4 or 5 floors and less than 75,000 sq ft or more than 5 floors and between 75,000 and 150,000 sq ft, the baseline building HVAC system for electric heat is packaged VAV system."
 
I've finished modeling the Baseline building with System 8, but now that I've read the User Manual, it would appear that I am supposed to use PVAV.  I really hope I don't have to go back and change the baseline system again.
 
Any thoughts?
 
Thanks

James,

I'd stick to Table G3.1.1A and use System 8. The wording in the 2004
User's Manual looks like a mistake. The wording in the Standard
90.1-2007 User's Manual, p.G-23, is changed to, "For intermediate-sized
buildings that are 4 or 5 floors and less than 25,000 sq ft or less than
6 floors and between 25,000 and 150,000 sq ft, the baseline building
HVAC system for electric heat is packaged VAV system."

Bill

You are correct that Appendix G requires outside air to be the same for both
as-designed and baseline models.  You would not be able to claim savings for
reduced ventilation airflow from a more efficient fume hood.   Similarly you
cannot claim credit for reduced ventilation airflow on displacement
ventilation and UFAD systems. 
 
However I see no reason why you wouldn't be able to claim the fan energy
savings associated with a more efficient fume hood.

The mechanical engineer for a campus laboratory building with 100% OA wants
to claim energy savings for reduced exhaust from more efficient fume hoods.
(Established design practice uses hoods with 100 fpm flow - they are
installing 70 fpm hoods. This reduces peak exhaust from 700 to 490 CFM per
hood.) My approach has always been to keep outside air, exhaust and
infiltration flows identical between the proposed and baseline models
(except for DCV). (This was not easy for this model with proposed VAV and
baseline constant volume packaged rooftops.)

 

Has anybody successfully claimed OA/exhaust/infiltration savings for a LEED
project?

The hoods are more "effective" really, not more efficient. They have no
fans, but are designed to effectively remove fumes with a lower flow
rate through them. All the hoods are connected to a central exhaust fan
system.

 

Now that you mention it, I guess I need to go back and add fan energy in
my baseline. The baseline has several systems (one per zone as required
in 90.1) where the proposed only has two air handlers and a common
exhaust fan. I will add a return fan with Pfan power (per G3.1.2.9) for
every system that serves a zone that, in the proposed design, is
connected to the common exhaust.

My two cents...

The same OSA for baseline vs as-designed makes sense for occupant-required
OSA, such that there is no reward for compromising occupant health to gain
LEED points.

However, that fraction of the fumehood OSA over and above occupancy-required
is *process* OSA, an opportunity where LEED *should *be encouraging
savings.  Now I'm not saying they do, just that they *should...*

And after rereading the requirements it shakes out that LEED really doesn't
give credit for reducing process outside air loads, keep the parametric run
in your model -- the local utility may see things differently, and
'recognize you' with a big fat rebate check.

Bill,
This is a fascinating convergence of issues.

Appendix G's requirement for the same minimum ventilation rate in the baseline as the proposed is true but also a bit incomplete when considering a design of a 100% OA VAV systems serving fume hoods.

We have a similar scenario of a small building with likely VAV hoods, possibly lower flow, likely served by a 100% outside air system BUT with my favorite added complexity of district heating and cooling.

Alas, while I was scratching my head, the client abandoned their LEED goal.

So I have not fully solved it for myself and cannot solve for it your project but I do suggest the following actions:
1) Read the 90.1-2004 prescriptive requirements for certain systems serving fume hoods to be VAV or have heat recovery.
2) Read the 90.1-2004 Appendix G base system selection section
3) Now read those same sections in 90.1-2007 and ponder which changes represent revisions and which ones represent clarifications of original intent
4) And maybe read the User's Manuals too
5) Consider the exceptional calculation method as the venue to claim energy savings, that you consider real but are not explicitly allowed or defined by the document, for consideration by the LEED reviewer
6) Research the existing CIR's
7) Before spending numerous hours on an approach that may or may not be accepted, buy a CIR and propose your tact to the USGBC itself. If they reject yours they almost certainly will dictate a new tact that their reviewer would be obligated to accept for your project.

And lastly, do not wade too much further through this on a Friday afternoon unless you have to do so. For me, tasks like this should be tackled early in the day and early in the week.

Good luck,

Paul

Bill, Paul, Mike, et al - 

 

We also have not mentioned another item relative to Appendix G, which
requires sizing the flow rate based on a 20-degree delta T. If the
system is a 100% OSA unit, and the baseline is sized for a 20-degree
space-to-coil temperature differential, what happens if the makeup air
unit  is not designed with a 20-degree delta-T? Then it is possible the
peak CFM rates could potentially vary. So right there, we could
potentially have a contradiction between 2 lines in Appendix G - (1) OSA
ventilation rates are to be identical, and (2) The baseline AHU flow
rate is specified by a 20-degree delta T - now, which statement in
Appendix G "over rules" the other?

 

This seems like this should fall under the Exceptional Calculation
methodology to explicitly document where the savings come from, and
whether the savings are justified...

 

Also regarding an earlier item from this thread, that one cannot take
credit for UFAD and displacement ventilation systems with reduced CFM
rates - as long as the OSA CFM rates are identical, then credit can be
taken from the UFAD/DV system design. You'll be providing the same OSA,
but different Total CFM rates could be calculated based on the different
mixed air temperatures and designed coil leaving temperatures. This can
be either a positive or negative, which truly depends on the climate and
the ability to maximize the economizer hours...

Bill,

This is a fascinating convergence of issues.  

 

Appendix G's requirement for the same minimum ventilation rate in the
baseline as the proposed is true but also a bit incomplete when
considering a design of a 100% OA VAV systems serving fume hoods.

 

We have a similar scenario of a small building with likely VAV hoods,
possibly lower flow, likely served by a 100% outside air system BUT with
my favorite added complexity of district heating and cooling.  

 

Alas, while I was scratching my head, the client abandoned their LEED
goal. 

 

So I have not fully solved it for myself and cannot solve for it your
project but I do suggest the following actions:

1) Read the 90.1-2004 prescriptive requirements for certain systems
serving fume hoods to be VAV or have heat recovery.  

2) Read the 90.1-2004 Appendix G base system selection section

3) Now read those same sections in 90.1-2007 and ponder which changes
represent revisions and which ones represent clarifications of original
intent

4) And maybe read the User's Manuals too

5) Consider the exceptional calculation method as the venue to claim
energy savings, that you consider real but are not explicitly allowed or
defined by the document, for consideration by the LEED reviewer

6) Research the existing CIR's

7) Before spending numerous hours on an approach that may or may not be
accepted, buy a CIR and propose your tact to the USGBC itself. If they
reject yours they almost certainly will dictate a new tact that their
reviewer would be obligated to accept for your project.

 

And lastly, do not wade too much further through this on a Friday
afternoon unless you have to do so. For me, tasks like this should be
tackled early in the day and early in the week.

 

Good luck,

 

Paul

	The mechanical engineer for a campus laboratory building with
100% OA wants to claim energy savings for reduced exhaust from more
efficient fume hoods. (Established design practice uses hoods with 100
fpm flow - they are installing 70 fpm hoods. This reduces peak exhaust
from 700 to 490 CFM per hood.) My approach has always been to keep
outside air, exhaust and infiltration flows identical between the
proposed and baseline models (except for DCV). (This was not easy for
this model with proposed VAV and baseline constant volume packaged
rooftops.)

	 

	Has anybody successfully claimed OA/exhaust/infiltration savings
for a LEED project?

Bill, Paul, Mike, et al - 

 

We also have not mentioned another item relative to Appendix G, which requires sizing the flow rate based on a 20-degree delta T. If the system is a 100% OSA unit, and the baseline is sized for a 20-degree space-to-coil temperature differential, what happens if the makeup air unit  is not designed with a 20-degree delta-T? Then it is possible the peak CFM rates could potentially vary. So right there, we could potentially have a contradiction between 2 lines in Appendix G - (1) OSA ventilation rates are to be identical, and (2) The baseline AHU flow rate is specified by a 20-degree delta T - now, which statement in Appendix G "over rules" the other?

 

This seems like this should fall under the Exceptional Calculation methodology to explicitly document where the savings come from, and whether the savings are justified...

 

Also regarding an earlier item from this thread, that one cannot take credit for UFAD and displacement ventilation systems with reduced CFM rates - as long as the OSA CFM rates are identical, then credit can be taken from the UFAD/DV system design. You'll be providing the same OSA, but different Total CFM rates could be calculated based on the different mixed air temperatures and designed coil leaving temperatures. This can be either a positive or negative, which truly depends on the climate and the ability to maximize the economizer hours...

We have successfully taken credit for reduced OSA rates in a number of applications where a "cascading" make-up air system has been designed.  In a kitchen hood application for instance, the traditional design might bring in 100% OSA to offset the hood exhaust from a separate intake or unit.  In certain projects (schools come to mind), this make-up air can be transferred into the space via adjacent spaces with high OSA requirements (i.e. commons), thus saving all or a portion of the mechanical energy to heat/cool this air.  We have always taken the path of the exceptional calculation for LEED purposes because this is definitely a grey area as far as Appendix G is concerned.

fpm flow - they are installing 70 fpm hoods. This reduces peak exhaust
from 700 to 490 CFM per hood.) My approach has always been to keep
outside air, exhaust and infiltration flows identical between the
proposed and baseline models (except for DCV). (This was not easy for
this model with proposed VAV and baseline constant volume packaged
rooftops.)

	 

	Has anybody successfully claimed OA/exhaust/infiltration savings
for a LEED project?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] MAXIMUM DAILY INTEGRATED COOLING LOAD
Message-ID: <4914CC79.2000708@edi-arch.com>

I am attempting to reconcile a cooling energy disecrepency between a 
LEED Proposed model and its Baseline. The Proposed is using a GSHP with 
ERV OA, while the Baseline uses PSZ-HP.

Quickly:
Baseline Model Peak Load is Larger
Baseline BLDG Monthly Load is Larger
Baseline HVAC Load is Larger

Proposed Cooling Demand and Consumption is greater
Proposed Solar Radiation BTUH is Larger

The only real discrepancy that I'm finding is in the SS-D, where the 
following is 0.00 for the Baseline and 3829.446 (KBTU) for the Proposed.

"MAXIMUM DAILY INTEGRATED COOLING LOAD (WTH FILE)"

What impact does this have?

Design temperatures, schedules, control, etc. are all consistant.

Bill,

This is a fascinating convergence of issues. 



Appendix G's requirement for the same minimum ventilation rate in the
baseline as the proposed is true but also a bit incomplete when
considering a design of a 100% OA VAV systems serving fume hoods.



We have a similar scenario of a small building with likely VAV hoods,
possibly lower flow, likely served by a 100% outside air system BUT with
my favorite added complexity of district heating and cooling. 



Alas, while I was scratching my head, the client abandoned their LEED
goal.



So I have not fully solved it for myself and cannot solve for it your
project but I do suggest the following actions:

1) Read the 90.1-2004 prescriptive requirements for certain systems
serving fume hoods to be VAV or have heat recovery. 

2) Read the 90.1-2004 Appendix G base system selection section

3) Now read those same sections in 90.1-2007 and ponder which changes
represent revisions and which ones represent clarifications of original
intent

4) And maybe read the User's Manuals too

5) Consider the exceptional calculation method as the venue to claim
energy savings, that you consider real but are not explicitly allowed or
defined by the document, for consideration by the LEED reviewer

6) Research the existing CIR's

7) Before spending numerous hours on an approach that may or may not be
accepted, buy a CIR and propose your tact to the USGBC itself. If they
reject yours they almost certainly will dictate a new tact that their
reviewer would be obligated to accept for your project.



And lastly, do not wade too much further through this on a Friday
afternoon unless you have to do so. For me, tasks like this should be
tackled early in the day and early in the week.



Good luck,



Paul

        My two cents...
       
        The same OSA for baseline vs as-designed makes sense for
occupant-required OSA, such that there is no reward for compromising
occupant health to gain LEED points.
       
        However, that fraction of the fumehood OSA over and above
occupancy-required is process OSA, an opportunity where LEED should be
encouraging savings.  Now I'm not saying they do, just that they
should...
       
        And after rereading the requirements it shakes out that LEED
really doesn't give credit for reducing process outside air loads, keep
the parametric run in your model -- the local utility may see things
differently, and 'recognize you' with a big fat rebate check.

I appreciate everyone's detailed responses to my query. The project I'm
modeling has 100% OA VAV for most of the building, while the App. G
baseline is System 3 - Constant volume packaged rooftops. This is a NY
State project that has to be "designed to meet the criteria for LEED"
but will not likely go through the certification process. One thing I
learned is that, even though OA was identical in my baseline and
proposed models (because "I modeled it that way") - it didn't actually
turn out to be true. Custom hourly eQUEST reports showed nearly twice as
much annual OA CFM in my baseline than in my proposed. Ouch. Glad I
checked.

Regards,

Bill

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Exhaust, outside air and infiltration for LEED



Bill,

This is a fascinating convergence of issues. 



Appendix G's requirement for the same minimum ventilation rate in the
baseline as the proposed is true but also a bit incomplete when
considering a design of a 100% OA VAV systems serving fume hoods.



We have a similar scenario of a small building with likely VAV hoods,
possibly lower flow, likely served by a 100% outside air system BUT with
my favorite added complexity of district heating and cooling. 



Alas, while I was scratching my head, the client abandoned their LEED
goal.



So I have not fully solved it for myself and cannot solve for it your
project but I do suggest the following actions:

1) Read the 90.1-2004 prescriptive requirements for certain systems
serving fume hoods to be VAV or have heat recovery. 

2) Read the 90.1-2004 Appendix G base system selection section

3) Now read those same sections in 90.1-2007 and ponder which changes
represent revisions and which ones represent clarifications of original
intent

4) And maybe read the User's Manuals too

5) Consider the exceptional calculation method as the venue to claim
energy savings, that you consider real but are not explicitly allowed or
defined by the document, for consideration by the LEED reviewer

6) Research the existing CIR's

7) Before spending numerous hours on an approach that may or may not be
accepted, buy a CIR and propose your tact to the USGBC itself. If they
reject yours they almost certainly will dictate a new tact that their
reviewer would be obligated to accept for your project.



And lastly, do not wade too much further through this on a Friday
afternoon unless you have to do so. For me, tasks like this should be
tackled early in the day and early in the week.



Good luck,



Paul

        My two cents...
       
        The same OSA for baseline vs as-designed makes sense for
occupant-required OSA, such that there is no reward for compromising
occupant health to gain LEED points.
       
        However, that fraction of the fumehood OSA over and above
occupancy-required is process OSA, an opportunity where LEED should be
encouraging savings.  Now I'm not saying they do, just that they
should...
       
        And after rereading the requirements it shakes out that LEED
really doesn't give credit for reducing process outside air loads, keep
the parametric run in your model -- the local utility may see things
differently, and 'recognize you' with a big fat rebate check.

        You are correct that Appendix G requires outside air to be the

claim savings for reduced ventilation airflow from a more efficient fume
hood.   Similarly you cannot claim credit for reduced ventilation
airflow on displacement ventilation and UFAD systems.

        

        However I see no reason why you wouldn't be able to claim the
fan energy savings associated with a more efficient fume hood.

LEED

        The mechanical engineer for a campus laboratory building with
100% OA wants to claim energy savings for reduced exhaust from more
efficient fume hoods. (Established design practice uses hoods with 100
fpm flow - they are installing 70 fpm hoods. This reduces peak exhaust
from 700 to 490 CFM per hood.) My approach has always been to keep
outside air, exhaust and infiltration flows identical between the
proposed and baseline models (except for DCV). (This was not easy for
this model with proposed VAV and baseline constant volume packaged
rooftops.)

        

        Has anybody successfully claimed OA/exhaust/infiltration savings
for a LEED project?

Chris - I believe you are on the right track.

The following 90.1-1999 definition applies:

fan system energy demand (or fan system power): the sum of the nominal power demand (nameplate horsepower) of motors of all fans that are required to operate at design conditions to supply air from the heating or cooling source to the conditioned space(s) and return it to the source or exhaust it to the outdoors.

So, you would have to include:  Supply fans (fan coils, make-up air unit), Return fans (if separate from supply fans) and Exhaust fans.

Thanks,

 Dan Russell, EIT

Dear all, 

 

The VAV minimum set point for system 7 in Appendix G is calculated based on
(0.4 cfm/ft2). For some spaces this number is bigger than the calculated
design airflow based on 20F delta T. What should the VAV set points be in
this case? 

 

Example:

Room:    

VAVmin = 131 l/s

Design Air Flow = 84 l/s 

Fresh Air = 108 l/s

 

Thank you for your input,

-----------------------------


Dear Colleagues,

After an incredibly successful turnout of over 50 people to the inaugural
meeting in September, I am pleased to announce the details for our second
meeting.  We are privileged to have Adrian Tuluca of Viridian Energy give a
presentation on advanced as well as simplified methods of simulating heat
flow analysis for building envelopes.  Perhaps more interestingly, he will
discuss the accuracy of both methods and when it is appropriate to use each
of them.

Technical Committees will also meet for the first time at this meeting
(8PM).  The "Building Modeling" technical committee - headed by Michael
Waite and Mike Karpman - will act as a forum for all types of building
modeling & software.  There is the potential for this group to organize
trainings and workshops for eQUEST and other software of interest.
Additionally, the "Real Building Performance" technical committee - headed
by Chris Benedict - will seek to compare actual performance to model
performance.  There is the potential for this committee to organize tours of
actual buildings as well as analyze case studies of efficient buildings.

Details of the upcoming meeting are below and can be found at
http://www.ibpsanyc.com
*
Winter Quarterly IBPSA-NY meeting*

*Presentation:* "2D & 3D Heat Flow Analysis for Building Envelopes" - Topics
will include various analysis techniques, their accuracies, and
limitations.  Examples will cover brick and block wall construction and
curtain wall construction.
*Location:* Atelier Ten Offices - 45 East 20th Street, 4th Floor, New York,
NY*
Date & Time:* Monday, December 8, 2008 - 6:30 PM.
*Draft Agenda:*

   - 6:30-7:00 PM - Networking & Snacks
   - 7:00-7:45 PM - Presentation by Adrian
   - 7:45-8:00 PM - Questions & Answers
   - 8:00-8:30 PM - Technical Committee Breakout Sessions
   - 8:30 PM - Continued Networking/Snacks


PLEASE *RSVP *(rashmi.sonal at burohappold.com) IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO ATTEND

*Speaker Bio:*

Adrian Tuluca, RA is Principal with Viridian Energy & Environmental LLC, an

Based on the fresh air volume in your example (108 l/s), the design air flow would have to be at least equal to that amount and probably higher unless the primary air handler is 100% fresh air.  The design air flow based on 20F delta T should always be trumped by the ventilation requirement, if ventilation requirement is larger than it.

In any case, I would maintain a minimum of 0.4 cfm/sf as a minimum level of ventilation simply as "good practice" to avoid stagnation.  This may mean using additional reheat energy or utilizing a fan-powered terminal unit to provide additional recirculation air.

However, if air stagnation is not a concern, and design air flow is less than 0.4cfm/sf then I would say that the minimum setpoint is at the discretion of the designer and any value less than or equal to 0.4 cfm/sf would not violate the intent of the requirement.  In the same way, if the cooling design load required 1.0 cfm/sf but the heating load for the space could be handled with less than 0.25 cfm/sf then I don't believe App G would require you to increase your minimum VAV setpoint to 0.4 since that would be a silly waste of energy.  The most extreme example of this logic is an interior zone, which has zero heating load and zero fresh air load...Since there is no reheat required, the 0.4 cfm/sf requirement does not apply and therefore the VAV damper could be allowed to fully close when the space is satisfied.  Due to Standard 62 this occurrence is highly improbable, but it helps to illustrate the point.

That's my two cents.

Thanks,

 Dan Russell, EIT

Dear all,

The VAV minimum set point for system 7 in Appendix G is calculated based on (0.4 cfm/ft2). For some spaces this number is bigger than the calculated design airflow based on 20F delta T. What should the VAV set points be in this case?

Example:
Room:
VAVmin = 131 l/s
Design Air Flow = 84 l/s
Fresh Air = 108 l/s

Thank you for your input,

Anis

THERM can be used for thermal analysis of any building structure (walls,
roofs, foundations, windows, etc.).  THERM uses 2-D finite element method
for conduction and radiation (explicit solution), and convection
(correlations), so any 2-D heat transfer problem can be easily analyzed.

All,

I'm modeling a building with water cooled self-contained units (one per floor).  These units contain up to five single speed compressors.  As system loads the individual compressors stage on and off.  I do not know how to fit the performance curve.  Step functions are not one of the options for curve fit.  Does anyone have any ideas?  And exactly which performance curve would I need to modify.  I'm assuming the temperature and flow curves would stay the same and only the part load curve would need to change.

Thanks,
D

Kevin,

 

This is an important question. I am not aware of a definitive answer. I
just looked at 90.1-2004, 90.1-2007 and the User's Manuals for both. I
see no change in 2007 specific to how to determine the equipment
efficiencies.

 

I agree that if you determine efficiency by the baseline equipment size,
you generally end up using better efficiencies for the baseline
equipment. As you mentioned, this is because you are required to model
one system per zone. At the same time, when you determine fan power
based on the baseline equipment size, you use higher kW/cfm. I am
finding that, because of this, my models rarely show cooling energy
savings, and usually show huge amounts of heating energy savings.
(Baseline furnaces are 80% efficient and my proposed systems approach
95%. Also, the buildings I model are mostly in NY - high heating hours.
I often have heat recovery systems, which also help with the heating but
not much with cooling.)

 

So, for know, it makes sense to me to determine the baseline
efficiencies and fan energies from the oversized (10%/25%) baseline
capacities. Knowing this, I have to avoid the tendency to model every
single space on the architectural drawings, and try bundling them better
into zones. (Make all the spaces served by one VAV box a single zone.
Make all the spaces served by a single-zone system one large zone,
unless the uses and orientations differ greatly. Etc.)

 

That's my $0.02.

My apologies but I must bring this up again, I get too easily confused.
My questions pertain specifically for getting EIR baseline for budget
system 3 or any budget system with Packaged Single Zones.

 

I am unclear on what capacity to use to get baseline efficiencies.
Generally, the proposed capacity of an air-side system will serve
multiply thermal zones but the baseline requires systems for each
thermal zone.  This creates base system capacities much lower depending
on zoning and appears that it may unfairly penalize depending on how the
zoning is done.  If a proposed system capacity is between 240,000 and
760,000 then would all baseline systems require a 9.3 EER or because all
single packaged zones have a baseline capacity of less than 65,000,
should baseline single packaged systems be 12.0 EER?

 

Secondly, it would appear more timely to generate baseline kW/CFM and
EIR based on proposed parameters and then input these numbers to each
packaged single zone corresponding to its proposed air-side system.
Although more favorable numbers may be obtained using baseline
parameters.  So if I am Calc'ing individual packaged single zone EIRs
and I cannot subtract the fan power found using proposed air-side system
CFM numbers but CFM numbers found from the baseline modeling reports and
also capacities found from autosized baseline modeling reports.  Any
thoughts?  Thanks.

Kevin,

 

1.)     What is your reasoning for sizing the baseline that way? Why
wouldn't you just autosize the baseline and increase by 15%/25%?

2.)     In eQUEST, what is the difference between these two methods:

a.       Specifying 1.15 and 1.25 for the cooling and heating capacity
ratios, respectively, without entering any numbers for capacities, and
using the resulting energy consumption

b.       Going back and manually entering the capacities that the
program reports and running the program again

3.)     For the EIR, I determine what efficiency to use based on the
oversized baseline capacity, but I could be convinced to size it on the
1.00 autosized capacity instead.

And the baseline EIR should include the wattage calc'd from G.3.1.2.9?

 

Backing up for a moment, there is a funny way to determine the
oversizing capacities, especially for PSZs.  Here goes:

 

Run the design model with design capacity, run the design model
autosized, find the ratio.

Run the baseline model autosized, apply the ratio.  Now oversize for 15%
cooling and 25% for heating.

 

Does anybody do this differently, because the fine print doesn't exactly
say that much.

I believe it is 15% oversize for cooling and 25% for heating (Page 176 -
Appendix G - ASHRAE-90.1-2004 - I don't have 2007 yet). This is aside
from fan calculations.

 

This would apply to either package units or central plant equipment,

You have to capture some of that 7% somehow by condensing, such as with
a second heat exchanger.

Kevin,

 

This is an important question. I am not aware of a definitive answer. I
just looked at 90.1-2004, 90.1-2007 and the User's Manuals for both. I
see no change in 2007 specific to how to determine the equipment
efficiencies.

 

I agree that if you determine efficiency by the baseline equipment size,
you generally end up using better efficiencies for the baseline
equipment. As you mentioned, this is because you are required to model
one system per zone. At the same time, when you determine fan power
based on the baseline equipment size, you use higher kW/cfm. I am
finding that, because of this, my models rarely show cooling energy
savings, and usually show huge amounts of heating energy savings.
(Baseline furnaces are 80% efficient and my proposed systems approach
95%. Also, the buildings I model are mostly in NY - high heating hours.
I often have heat recovery systems, which also help with the heating but
not much with cooling.)

 

So, for know, it makes sense to me to determine the baseline
efficiencies and fan energies from the oversized (10%/25%) baseline
capacities. Knowing this, I have to avoid the tendency to model every
single space on the architectural drawings, and try bundling them better
into zones. (Make all the spaces served by one VAV box a single zone.
Make all the spaces served by a single-zone system one large zone,
unless the uses and orientations differ greatly. Etc.)

 

That's my $0.02.

My apologies but I must bring this up again, I get too easily confused.
My questions pertain specifically for getting EIR baseline for budget
system 3 or any budget system with Packaged Single Zones.

 

I am unclear on what capacity to use to get baseline efficiencies.
Generally, the proposed capacity of an air-side system will serve
multiply thermal zones but the baseline requires systems for each
thermal zone.  This creates base system capacities much lower depending
on zoning and appears that it may unfairly penalize depending on how the
zoning is done.  If a proposed system capacity is between 240,000 and
760,000 then would all baseline systems require a 9.3 EER or because all
single packaged zones have a baseline capacity of less than 65,000,
should baseline single packaged systems be 12.0 EER?

 

Secondly, it would appear more timely to generate baseline kW/CFM and
EIR based on proposed parameters and then input these numbers to each
packaged single zone corresponding to its proposed air-side system.
Although more favorable numbers may be obtained using baseline
parameters.  So if I am Calc'ing individual packaged single zone EIRs
and I cannot subtract the fan power found using proposed air-side system
CFM numbers but CFM numbers found from the baseline modeling reports and
also capacities found from autosized baseline modeling reports.  Any
thoughts?  Thanks.

Kevin,

 

1.)     What is your reasoning for sizing the baseline that way? Why
wouldn't you just autosize the baseline and increase by 15%/25%?

2.)     In eQUEST, what is the difference between these two methods:

a.       Specifying 1.15 and 1.25 for the cooling and heating capacity
ratios, respectively, without entering any numbers for capacities, and
using the resulting energy consumption

b.       Going back and manually entering the capacities that the
program reports and running the program again

3.)     For the EIR, I determine what efficiency to use based on the
oversized baseline capacity, but I could be convinced to size it on the
1.00 autosized capacity instead.

And the baseline EIR should include the wattage calc'd from G.3.1.2.9?

 

Backing up for a moment, there is a funny way to determine the
oversizing capacities, especially for PSZs.  Here goes:

 

Run the design model with design capacity, run the design model
autosized, find the ratio.

Run the baseline model autosized, apply the ratio.  Now oversize for 15%
cooling and 25% for heating.

 

Does anybody do this differently, because the fine print doesn't exactly
say that much.

Kevin:

 

I believe it is 15% oversize for cooling and 25% for heating (Page 176 -
Appendix G - ASHRAE-90.1-2004 - I don't have 2007 yet). This is aside
from fan calculations.

 

This would apply to either package units or central plant equipment,
whichever is specified as baseline.

Hi
Please excuse me if some of the nomenclature is unfamiliar - I'm from 
the UK!

Q1: I'm used to citing CIBSE as my preferred source of internal gains 
info. However, the information is now a little dated and doesn't even 
cover TFT screens. Is ASHRAE any better in this department? If not, is 
there any reliable source that I can cite for modern desktops, laptops 
and TFT screens?

Q2: As temperature increases the human body gives off less `sensible 
heat' and more latent heat. Can anybody cite any data regarding this 
phenomenon? Again, there used to be a table in CIBSE guide A (1999) but 
it was withdrawn in later versions.

Is ASHRAE any better in this department? If not, is > there any reliable source that I can cite for modern desktops, laptops > and TFT screens?I'm replying with immediate access to the 2001 ASHRAE Fundamentals only - the current version is 2005 (so the information might also be slightly outdated). Chapter 29 (Nonresidential Cooling and Heating Load Calculation Procedures) [Chapter 30 in the 2005 version] cites studies from 1994 and 1999 for typical computer loads (Table 8 for typical computer equipment). I have found this study from 2002 more useful: http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1567&context=lbnl It offers interesting comarisons between CRT versus LCD screens, monitor consumption as a function of display colors, PC activity, operating systems, etc. It is however based on data measured 6/7 years ago ... EnergyStar offers a calculator which could be of interest: http://www.energystar.gov/ia/business/bulk_purchasing/bpsavings_calc/Calc_monitors.xls These studies/tools are indeed useful (does anyone know of more recent studies ...?), but the data they're based on is likely outdated in many areas. If you're seriously interested in getting a detailed assessment, I wouldn't hesitate in purchasing a power analyzer/line meter ... Good knowledge of occupant mobility is also critical (field studies have shown that office workers can be absent from the offices/workstations between 25% and 50% of the time ... information not readily available). Finally, you should also check the ASHRAE RP 1093 project literature (e.g. http://repositories.tamu.edu/browse?value=Abushakra%2C+B.&type=author)> Q2: As temperature increases the human body gives off less `sensible > heat' and more latent heat. Can anybody cite any data regarding this > phenomenon? Again, there used to be a table in CIBSE guide A (1999) but > it was withdrawn in later versions. Table 1 in Chapter 29 of the ASHRAE Fundamentals (Nonresidential Cooling and Heating Load Calculation Procedures) contains sensible (radiant versus convective) versus latent heat (high versus low air velocity) for adult males and an 'adjusted' male/female/children distribution. That's a quick fix - that's a field in itself.

Good Morning,

I am working on a central energy plant application that involves chilled
water.  I am trying to determine the billing unit thermal value for the
chilled water meter, and the default value is 1,000,000 BTU's per
billing unit.  Is this default value supposed to be used commonly or if
I wanted to have the water billed in terms of gallons alter the number?
Also I have setup my building shell in the wizard edit mode and when I
simulate the building's performance my interior lighting value is zero.
Has anyone run into this before?

Thanks,

Dear Dan,
 
There's only one "fanwall" manufacturer (Mammoth), so I'd start with them.
However, physics is physics, and motor efficiencies are known from each
motor manufacturer.  Thus, knowing which motor mfr is used will help, as
will the fan curve for all those small backward inclined, airfoil fans.
 
As you may know, plug fans such as are used by fanwalls have (generally)
poor documentation regarding their performance inside a cabinet.  The wall
spacing and direction of discharge (axial vs. radial) affect performance
significantly.  Here again, I'd start by talking to the manufacturing
source.  The local sales rep may not have the info, but Mammoth is pretty
good at their tech support.  
 
Finally, I suspect that the differences in performance from a single fan
application will be rather small and a specific single fan application might
actually give BETTER performance than a fanwall, depending on how close you
are to the curve "sweet spot" for your specific application.  Benefits from
a fanwall are more likely (in my opinion) to be related to space
requirements, redundancy, and sound.
 
Good luck (and please share your findings!)

Following up on the the problem I addressed a week ago regarding the 
SS-D report and "MAXIMUM DAILY INTEGRATED COOLING LOAD" at the bottom of 
that page:

On page 140 of the DOE22 Vol. 4-Libraries PDF, I found the following:

*Bottom of Report*
At the bottom of the report (/SS-D/) are the peak daily integrated 
cooling load for the design day (DES DAY) and for the annual run using 
the weather file (WTH FILE). These numbers are used by PLANT to size 
cold storage systems.

I am not using cold storage, does anyone know why a GSHP system would 
encounter this in eQuest or any realm of DOE2 for that matter? OR does 
anyone know why else my ASHRAE baseline (PSZ-HP) would require more 
cooling energy than the GSHP?

I imagine, based on ground temperatures eQuest wants cooling to be 
generated by the "PLANT" in order to maintain system equalibrium; and 
the 3829.446 (KBTU) that I'm seeing is the amount deficit (?).

Much thanks!

According to most sources, the 2005 Epact has been extended until 2013
as part of the recent financial bail-out measures. I have a few
questions in that regard:

 

1)      Will ASHRAE 90.1-2001 remain the standard, or will it be
upgraded to a later version with the extension?

2)      Is 50% energy savings over a 90.1 building a plateau or are the
incentives pro-rated with savings under 50%?

3)      Does the tax credit require full system modeling for any
improvements even though those improvements may only involve lighting or
heating?

4)      Does 90.1 remain the baseline even in retro-fit applications for
this credit? (versus LEED that allows the base line to reflect the
actual building)?

No other changes were made to the original requirements.

The 50% reduction requirement is only for reducing the heating, cooling, lighting, and hot water.  The baseline remains 90.1-2001 with addenda through March 2003.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Epact 2005

According to most sources, the 2005 Epact has been extended until 2013 as part of the recent financial bail-out measures. I have a few questions in that regard:

 

1)      Will ASHRAE 90.1-2001 remain the standard, or will it be upgraded to a later version with the extension?

2)      Is 50% energy savings over a 90.1 building a plateau or are the incentives pro-rated with savings under 50%?

3)      Does the tax credit require full system modeling for any improvements even though those improvements may only involve lighting or heating?

4)      Does 90.1 remain the baseline even in retro-fit applications for this credit? (versus LEED that allows the base line to reflect the actual building)?

Hi!

For small power internal gains, a good source for European equipment is 
http://www.eu-energystar.org/fr/index.html. There is a database with the 
certified power in mode idle, sleep and off of desktop computers, LCD 
monitors (it seems that CRD are not any more certified), laptop and 
other equipment. If you are interested, I downloaded and processed their 
data, and then I can send you an Excel file with these data.

Unfortunately, there is much less information about small power 
equipment use?it seems that generally active use of computer is less 
than 50 % of the working time, but it is difficult to do 
generalizations, due to a very large differences between users and a 
general lack of field studies. Actually, I found only a French study 
about it, and it is in French.

Another difficulty I found in assessing internal gains due to small 
power equipment is that printers are generally very consuming, but I 
have few data about the ratio printers/occupants in office buildings and 
nothing about their actual use.

As I am very interested to the field, please let me know if you find any 
interesting source about the subject! And feel free to contact me 
directly if you have any question or comment about what I said!

Best regards,

Marcello CACIOLO

I see input for stages in the PVVT system section but then parallel flow fan powered boxes are not an optional selection.? 

Is there a way to use a step function in the DX performance curves?? Or am I out of options?

Message-ID: <4B55C0CF3DB1354A9524C7D455EE6D49C63465@HQGTNEVS-04.doe.local>

 
EnergyPlus Version 3.0 Available 

 

The latest release of the EnergyPlus building energy simulation program,
Version 3.0, was completed on November 13, 2008 and is now available in
versions for both the Windows and Linux operating systems. (Macintosh
version will be available within a few days.)  A few key new features
include ventilated slab, fully-coupled 1-D finite element heat and
moisture transport model, thermal chimney, CoolTower, additional
detailed refrigeration component models, DC-to-AC inverter and simple
battery, and direct output to SQLite. We have updated and extended
capabilities throughout the existing building envelope, daylighting, and
HVAC equipment and systems portions of the program. 

 

EnergyPlus V 3.0 is available at no cost from the EnergyPlus web site:
www.energyplus.gov <http://www.energyplus.gov/> .

Energy Design Plugin for Google SketchUp: The Energy Design Plugin
<http://www.energyplus.gov/energy_design_plugin.cfm>  is a free plugin
for the GoogleSketchUp 3D drawing program. The plugin makes it easy to
create and edit the building geometry in your EnergyPlus input files.
The plugin also allows you to launch EnergyPlus simulations and view the
results without leaving SketchUp.

EnergyPlus Example File Generator: A Web-based service is available that
creates and runs EnergyPlus input files for simple models of commercial
buildings. The input files (and annual results summary files) are sent
to your e-mail address as attachments. This is a pilot project and is
currently made available only as a BETA service. You can access the
service and customize the characteristics of the building you want to
model on the EnergyPlus Example File Generator Application
<http://www.energyplus.gov/cfm/inputs/>  (pop-ups must be enabled).

The set of example input files now includes full-blown models of typical
new construction (drawn from the DOE Commercial Benchmarks project). 




What's New in Version 3.0?

 

Datasets

*         Refrigerant properties for R404a, R410a, and R507a added to
the refrigerant database.

*         New library of compressor performance curves for refrigeration
systems created.

*         New performance curves for condensing and high-temperature
boilers.

*         California Title 24 Time Dependent Valuation (TDV) factor
schedules (2008) dataset added.

*         California Title 24 operating schedules dataset added.

 

Input

*         Version 3.0 includes widespread changes to input syntax. The
complete set of input objects was revised to make EnergyPlus's input
'language' more consistent, logical, and informative. Although the
majority of words used to describe input object names, field names and
key choices have changed, the underlying meanings remain the same. (Yes,
this will require substantial changes to input data files--aided by the
Transition program which can be accessed through the EP-Launch utility.)

*         New examples input files for all new features.

 

Zone Model

*         New Ventilated Slab model includes radiant heating and cooling
interactions with hollow core slabs

*         Infiltration models now allow air flow rate per unit of
exterior wall area as an optional input.

*         Pipe heat transfer loads added into zone air heat balance
calculations.

*         New optional algorithms for fully-coupled, 1-D finite element
heat and moisture transport model for simulating the movement and
storage of heat & moisture in and through building surfaces.

*         Moisture transfer function and moisture finite difference
models removed.

*         The algorithm for variable system timestep was revised.
Changes include uniform system timestep length across zone timestep and
stricter management of history terms for zone air conditions.

 

Natural and Mechanical Ventilation

*         Additional hybrid (mixed-mode) ventilation controls added to
allow global control of surface openings based on master zone, limit
opening levels based on wind speed, and allow control of Mixing and
Ventilation objects.

*         Temperature limit controls added to Mixing and Cross-Mixing
objects.

*         New Thermal Chimney model added--uses solar radiation to
enhance natural ventilation.

*         New CoolTower model added--uses natural evaporative cooling to
cool incoming air.

*         Added new outside air minimum and maximum fractions to easily
model 100% (or any fixed value) OA systems, leakage or stuck OA dampers.

 

HVAC

*         Refrigeration system capabilities expanded with more detailed
component models. Users can now simulate: (1) variable evaporating
temperatures, (2) variable condensing temperatures, (3) mechanical
subcoolers that transfer refrigeration loads from less efficient low-
temperature systems to more efficient medium-temperature systems, and
(4) liquid suction subcoolers.

*         Improved error trapping for refrigerant and glycol properties
at extreme temperatures and pressures.

*         Single-speed cooling towers can now use fluid bypass as
capacity control, saving water but requiring more fan energy.

*         New linear curve to complement other curve objects.

*         Absorption chiller now can connect to steam or hot water loop.

*         Enhanced absorption chiller model added.

*         Radiant-convective baseboard model added.

*         Boiler model upgraded to include performance curve which
accounts for load as function of operating temperatures.

*         Set Point Managers now test for control node conflicts.

*         New system availability managers added: Scheduled On, and
Scheduled Off.

*         New Underground Pipe object added; upgraded Pipe Heat Transfer
objects.

*         New Fluid Cooler objects added--single and two-speed dry
cooling towers for hydronic loops.

*         Component sizing factors added for boilers, chillers, and
cooling towers.

*         Added chilled water thermal storage tank models for both mixed
and stratified tanks.

 

On-Site Energy Supply

*         PV model restructured to separately model inverters and
storage systems.

*         DC-to-AC inverter model added along with simple battery model.

*         Simple Photovoltaic-Thermal model added for pre-heating
outside air and hot water heating.

 

Economics

*         Energy cost calculations now includes real time pricing,
minimum monthly charge, and buy/sell/net metering as new inputs

*         A new monetary unit object (Currency Type) added

*         Additional economic reporting of energy and demand for each
charge

 

Output

*         SQLite added as another output format option, providing
optional export of time-series results directly to database.

 

Utilities

*         EP-Launch now handles blank weather files as if no weather
file is specified in group simulations.

*         IDF Editor new features include wrapping long text strings
over multiple lines within cells, required fields now shown with blue
field names, and added recently used file list.

*         WinEPDraw can be used with older (pre V3) files as well as V3
files - if placed in the proper folder.

 

Documentation and Guides

*         Input/Output Reference and Engineering Reference updated and
extended for all new features and updates and renaming. Total
documentation now exceeds 3800 pages.

 

And many other enhancements and speed improvements throughout.  

See http://www.energyplus.gov/features.html
<http://www.energyplus.gov/features.html>   for a complete list of new
features added in this and previous versions.

Suggestion: get as much memory as possible in your computer for running
EnergyPlus.  A recent team upgrade from 1.8GHZ machine with 768MB memory
to a 2.1GHZ machine with 2GB memory caused one file to go from a full
annual simulation (5 zones) at about 8 minutes to a 2-1/4 minute run on
the newer machine. 



Update on User Interfaces and Tools?

Many user interfaces that create and run EnergyPlus input files and
display results graphically are available (Demand Response Quick
Assessment Tool, DesignBuilder, Easy EnergyPlus, EFEN, Hevacomp, and
HLCP) and under development (ComFen, TREATPlus and EPlusInterface).
Check our web site (http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_interfaces.html
<http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_interfaces.html>  ) for up-to-date
information on these and other interfaces.

Utilities and tools for creating, editing, and running input files that
come with EnergyPlus include IDF Editor, EP-Launch, and HVAC-Diagram
(see http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_utilities.html
<http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_utilities.html>  ). Third party tools for
creating, editing, and displaying EnergyPlus input files are also
available, including DrawBDL, EcoTect, EnergyPlugged, ESP-r, Green
Building Studio, EzDrawPlus, IFCtoIDF, TSe+, and EzPlus-Parm.  See
http://www.energyplus.gov/third_party_tools.html
<http://www.energyplus.gov/third_party_tools.html>  for more
information.

 

 

EnergyPlus Training Workshops

 

We will continue to offer training workshops throughout 2008 and 2009.
For more information, please see:  http://www.gard.com/training.htm
<http://www.gard.com/training.htm> 

 


What's going on in V3.0.0?

 

Will there be any considerable difference between version 2.2 and 3.0? 

Yes.... and no.  The basic structure of EnergyPlus is still as it has
been but there are some significant changes that you will want to be
aware of.

As always, there are a number of new features and bug fixes.  The
highlights of features for this version are listed below-see
www.energyplus.gov/features.html
<http://www.energyplus.gov/features.html>  for a complete list of new
features added in this and previous versions.

How about IDF and IDD? Do they remain unchanged?

There has been a whole scale revamping of the IDD/IDF naming structure
and the names of most objects and key values have changed. Your best
option is to use the included Transition program if you want to use any
older version files.

Is version 3.0 backward compatible? Can I run v2.2 file in v3.0? 

See previous item. There are many changes that require you to use the
transition program for V3.0. EP-Launch can check the selected file (if
there is a version object) and you can launch the Transition program
from the EP-Launch "File" menu. You can also view the ObjectStatus
<outbind://115/ObjectStatus.xls>  spreadsheet in the root folder of the
installed version. This file has detailed explanations of changes to the
objects. There is also a new option for the transition program that
allows you to supply a list of files and it will convert them for you.
The transition program is described more fully in the Auxiliary Programs
<outbind://115/Documentation/AuxiliaryPrograms.pdf>  document. In
addition, we can make available a zip file of all transitions programs
and batch files such that files can be taken from much earlier versions
to current version.

Alec,

I am looking at modeling a much simpler refrigerated building, wine storage
building, 55'F or so, and noted that you had spent some time recently
exploring using EQuest to model another similar building. We plan to use the
model to go through the LEED EA credit 1 process. In particular I am
interested in how helpful the refrigeration model was and was it able to
model the intricacies of the refrigeration design. Our system is a much
simpler system with DX split systems that have vfd's on condenser fans and
ecm motors on the indoor fan coils.

 

Any tips that you can provide as to the process that you followed to
complete the model would be appreciated.

 

Sincerely,

told that no one had signed up for the Specialty Update sessions, so they
were cancelled.  This seemed odd to me since the posts from the speakers

Question on PIU vs. VAV systems in eQuest...

 

If a PIU system has only SVAV boxes and all other parameters are
identical, does the PIU act like a VAV in eQuest?  Only changing the
system type in my model seems to have a significant impact on energy
usage and I can't track down why that is.  The difference is significant
enough that with App. G System 7 VAV w/RH, the choice between PIU and
VAV has an effect on the number of points.  Any thoughts would be
appreciated.

 

 

Thanks,

 

Matt

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fancoils and ERV
Message-ID: <000001c94a67$dd5e1ff0$981a5fd0$@com>

I am Modeling the retirement center.

 

 

 

1.       The main floor common areas are served by 41 @  2 pipe fan-coil
units spread throughout. The outdoor air requirement for each zone being
served by the fan-coil units is fed from a roof mounted ERV unit with
built-in gas fired heating and DX cooling.  Further, the outdoor air is
pre-conditioned by the ERV unit and fed directly into the return ducts of
the individual fan-coil units.

 

Question 1.                         We would prefer to individually zone the
main floor based on the 'space use'. What is the proper way to set-up the
outdoor air portion of the program to allow for preconditioned Outdoor air
and take advantage  of the energy savings we will get from the ERV?

 

Question 2.                         If the zones throughout the main floor
are not separated by solid walls, How will we create the partitions between
zones?

 

 

Is there a way to do it?

RetScreen is a good option, as is HOMER.  HOMER is a bit more focused on

Message-ID: <F65C1ECF836F09418EBE88D3E33A8D2D021C98B3@eurxmb06.global.arup.com>

Hi,

I am trying to find a proper way to model an ETFE cushion in a dynamic
thermal modelling software. The main problem is that ETFE is not opaque
to longwave, so modelling it as glazing is not acceptable. The radiant
temperature is the main output of these calculations. Sizing the effect
of longwave for different conditions would be also interesting as an
output. I was wondering if there is a software that could handle this
kind of materials or if there is a way in existing software to go around
this problem and get reliable results.

Thanks a lot,

Harris Poirazis

Amarpreet,

The .stat files on the weather portion of the EnergyPlus website have calculated HDD/CDD numbers for places around the world.

For example: http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata/2_asia_wmo_region_2/ARE_Abu.Dhabi_IWEC.stat

It has both base 10C (50F) and base 18C (65F) numbers towards the bottom.

Folks,
?
Does anyone know what the cooling degree days (base 50) for dubai / Abu/dhabi are?, ASHRAE seems to have a number of locations but nothing for UAE, Iran etc.
?
thanks

Message-ID: <cdf76d820811201124w59947718m1a83bb4530517ebb@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

This AZ central article about the ASU inflated bubble practice facility
says:

Rogers wasn't specific on what it will cost to air-condition the bubble, but
she said a comparative study on a similar structure in Texas showed it was
not extremely expensive, in part because it is air-conditioned for only part
of the year.

(
http://www.azcentral.com/sports/asu/articles/2008/07/01/20080701asububble.html
)

I am looking for this or other studies of energy performance of inflated
bubble sports practice facilities compared to alternate ways of doing it.

Thanks,

Ramana.

They're going to have to condition all the air needed to keep the bubble
inflated.  Plus remove all the heat generated by the large fan.  Is there
any "structure" to this building, or is it just kept up using air?  Is it
insulated?  Does it allow light through?  How air tight is it?  How many
cfm's are they losing (and having to supply--conditioned) through the walls?

These are some important questions that will affect their energy use.

Tim,

 

Table G3.1, No. 6(d) states: "Lighting system power shall include all
lighting system components shown or provided for on the plans (including
lamps and ballasts and task and furniture-mounted fixtures). Exception:
For multifamily living units, hotel/motel guest rooms, and other spaces
in which lighting systems are connected via receptacles and are not
shown or provided for on building plans, assume identical lighting power
for the proposed and baseline designs in the simulations, but exclude
these loads when calculating the baseline building performance and
proposed building performance." [Emphasis in original.]

 

The way I would implement this is to assign the same W/ft2 lighting to
all dorm rooms on a different meter in both the baseline and proposed
designs. Then I would subtract the kWh of that meter from the building
performance. You could still show lighting savings if you do the
space-by-space method for both designs (assuming the lighting in your
corridors and common areas is efficient).

Bill

If you only need to ballpark the cost of a PV system and its output
(thus payback), PVwatts might work for you.

But if you actually need a tool for designing and specifying a PV system
well enough so that it can be built, you need something like Maui Solar
Software. It has modules for grid-tied PV systems, grid-intertied PV
systems, or stand-alone PV systems, as well as Solar Hot water systems.
You can add the latest and greatest panels, inverters, & batteries, or
collectors & tanks if they aren't already in the software. You can model
the solar resource available at the collectors (times when they are
shaded), simulate the building/ occupant's load schedule, and even have
the hourly calculations simulate the savings if one has complicated
Time-Of-Use Metering. It uses the standard TMY hourly climate data
files.

But even though this is the most accurate renewable energy design
software I know of, I recommend that if you haven't been trained in
solar system design, that you get some training before you attempt to do
so, because there are a lot very costly mistakes you can make in design
and implementation. And if you screw it up, you'll be blowing one of the
client's biggest investments and giving solar a bad name. We had enough
of that from amateurs in the 1970s, so at least have a pro check your
work.
Good luck!

Commercial Building Benchmarks Now Available

DOE, working with three national laboratories, has developed commercial
building benchmark models. These benchmark models are complete
descriptions of buildings for whole building energy analysis using
EnergyPlus <http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/> , a
simulation program. There are 16 building types that represent
approximately 70% of the commercial buildings in the U.S., in each of 16
locations, representing all U.S. climate zones.  Currently new
construction benchmarks are available -- based on ASHRAE Standard 90.1.
The benchmark files are available for:

Building Type Name	 Floor Area ft2	 Number of Floors	
Large office	 498,590	 12	
Medium office	 53,630	 3	
Small office	 5,500	 1	
Warehouse	 52,050	 1	
Stand-alone retail	 24,690	 1	
Strip mall 	22,500	 1	
Primary school	 73,960	 2	
Secondary school	 204,170	 3

Fast food	 2,500	 1	
Restaurant	 5,500	 1	
Hospital	 241,350	 5	
Outpatient health care	 10,000	 2	
Small Hotel	 43,200	 2	
Large Hotel	 122,116	 6	
Midrise Apartment	 33,600	 4	


Each Benchmark building is comprised of:


*	An EnergyPlus
<http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/>  software input
file (.idf) 
*	An html file showing the results from the EnergyPlus simulation
(.html) 
*	A scorecard that summarizes the inputs and results for each
location (.pdf) 
*	The EnergyPlus TMY2 weather file (.epw). 

The benchmarks can either be downloaded by building type or by location.

Using eQuest, I completed a large high school campus using numerous 
shells.  When finished, I revisited the shells to define the zones.  I 
discovered that some (not all) of the shell names defined in the DD 
Wizzard do not correspond to the shell designation in the component tree. 
For example the shell name E13 in the DD Wizzard becomes E 8 in the 
component tree.  I would appreciate any assistance anyone can provide 
regarding this issue.

The dorm itself is a "dwelling unit", which is exempt from the entire
Chapter 9 requirements (2004 uses the term "living unit"). So I think
the 1.1 W/sf or 1.0 W/sf does not apply to the dorm room. My opinion is
that the lpd in the baseline dorm room should be the same as in the
proposed building unless the applicant convinces the "rating authority"
that what they are proposing is a "significant verifiable departure from
documented conventional practice", per Appendix G.

contribution, can I really do a building wide lpd calc and claim the
savings shown on the plans??

 

Any suggestions??

 

Thanks.

Hi all,
I have an equest model of a commercial building that is implementing a pond source heat pump heating and cooling.  I'm using a Pkgd Var Vol Var Temp HVAC system with the Heat Pump heating and cooling.  I'm not sure if any of you can help me with this, but I keep getting results that say I'm out of throttling range 70% of the time.  I'm pretty sure the heat pump capacity is adequate for the building, but I'm not sure what else could cause this problem.  Does anyone have any suggestions?
Thanks,
Philip

All,

I'm a new eQuest user and I'm trying to model a low-rise residential building. The building is naturally ventilated for 8 months of the year and for the 4 summer months stand-alone air coolers will be used along with ceiling fans. Is there a way to specify these parameters in eQuest?

Thank you,

Hi,
 
Can anyone suggest the best approach to modeling combined CO2 with
economizer control?  The economizer should override the CO2 sensors, but in
eQuest it seems to work the other way around (i.e. I get mechanical space
cooling activated instead of free cooling). 
 
Thanks,

Message-ID: <141D50E6B1F9E247BD450DA0BB288FE1039F115E@l-aexc01.global.arup.com>

Hi All,
I am trying to do an energy modeling using ASHRAE 90.1 performance
rating method for a building in Mexico City, Mexico. I am trying to
figure out where Mexico City would fall under for the climate zone.
Table B-3 tells me the Zone number but it does not tell me the Climate
Type (A, B or C). So, I followed the Table B-4. This does not classify
between A or B for zone 3 based on the degree days. I also went through
Appendix B2 (Major climate type definitions) page 109. I was able to
climate that it is not Climate Zone type C. But in order to verify
whether I am in B, I need to know the annual precipitation. Where do I
get this value from? Will it be in ASHRAE or any other standards? I
searched in the website and I am getting different values for Mexico
city precipitation. Depending on this I would either fall in A or B.
Would like to follow some standards rather than searching in the
website. 

I am writing this story because I need to figure out whether my baseline
would require an economizer or not. Zone-3A does not require an
economizer where as Zone-3B does. 

Any guidance will be appreciated.
Thanks,
Yuvaraj

90.1 climate zoneHello Yuvaraj:

Mexico City climate is a 3A classification and therefore there is no requirement for an economizer system.  

The annual average temperature is 64F, and the annual rainfall is 25.7 inches.  Using the formula on page 112 of 90.1-2007, the precipitation criteria is 19.58".  Since the 25.7" does not fall below 19.58", it fails in the criteria for dry zone B.  It also fails to meet the marine criteria (zone C), and therefore it classifies as moist (zone A).

Regards,

Larry

Hi,

Is there anyone can lead me to resources where information about typical post office buildings in the US can the found. I'm particularly interested in energy modeling related information, such as size, construction, activity area, lighting density, plug loads, etc. Also, I'm wondering whether there is any statistic data for the energy consumption of typical post office buildings in the US?

Thanks and wish you all have a wonderful holiday,

For the purpose of acceptability limits, can anybody cite any guidance

and it states: "mean monthly outdoor temperature is the arithmetic 
average of the mean daily minimum and the mean daily maximum outdoor 
(dry bulb) temperature for the month in question."

The cited method sounds like a carry-over from when stations reported only 
max/min temperatures.
If hourly data is available, why wouldn't you just calculate the mean of all 
the temperatures ?

There is a small difference between the arithmetic mean of the monthly 
mean max and min and the overall arithmetic mean of 720 hours of weather 
data. Like you say, it's probably a legacy from the old pen and paper days.
I've heard that some would use occupied period only to calculate the 
mean. However, I can not find any reference in the text of A55 to 
justify this. Being able to average the warmer occupied hours would make 
things a whole lot easier - even the 80% acceptability temperature can 
regularly be lower than the summertime peaks. It's a tough call for 
natural ventilation.

Many thanks

Chris

Hi Bill,
In terms of engineering simplicity I'm 100% with you. In terms of code 
compliance however, I'm eager to demonstrate the most thorough 
implementation of the procedure - covering my BS with both hands! My 
client has paid me for thermal sim to cover his in turn. I've actually 
submitted the query to ASHRAE as well and will inform on this list of 
the outcome.
I do see building science as a bit of an "inexact science" and your 
software does appear to bring some of the old school rules of thumb more 
up to date with the benefits of computing. Whilst it isn't quite what I 
need right now, it is entirely laudable - best of luck.
Once again, many thanks.
Chris

I was just responding to Chris' seemingly innocuous question on how to calculate the mean monthly outdoor temperature. How is that related to your program or any other loads or energy calculation method?  I haven't seen your program, but from your description, it sounds like a derivative of the ASHRAE TC47 bin method. When that first came out in the mid-70s, weren't there complaints then, too, that it was too complicated, compared to the previous degree-day method ?  I guess it's all a matter of your perspective. If I may generalize, a degree-day method reduces everything to a single calculation, a bin method calculates a few score of snapshot conditions, while an hourly simulation tracks the building hour-by-hour for 8760 hours.  Each has their limitations and applicability.

But back to what I had said about calculating the mean monthly outdoor temperature from hourly data, this has nothing to do with any calculation or simulation method. If the data are available, it can be done using a spreadsheet program in literally a few seconds, which is why I'm puzzled by your response.

  Where did you people get the idea the method used only max and min temperatures?  It uses total annual heating and cooling bin hours and langleys.  The DOE developed the method using nomographs - it works for them, and I don't see why it can't work equally as well now.  I do not claim it is as accurate as the full blown methods on the market that tabulate loads for every hour and every day.  (If you really want to get pedantic, that method is quite inaccurate, considering the extreme variability in weather.) My method is a very good approximation - it is quick enough that the program operates like a spreadsheet, and gives instantaneous data for every change made in the model.  You see the results on the same screen, and so can see exactly what the result of changing roof color (which is dramatic), adding double paned windows (which is effective only on south and west facing windows), changing outside wall color (which has a significant impact), and so forth.  What other program can claim that kind of immediate result?  You see the effect on annual load from every single building element, and can tweak them individually to find out what works best ~ all this one one screen, real time ~ no waiting for massive print outs with every iteration.

  Actually, there are just as many draw backs to the "standard" and "accepted" methods that do hourly calculations ~ the weather is so variable and undependable. All anybody can do is develop a method that gives dependable results, and that's what my program does ~ as good as any product out there.  Moreover, my software is quite simple ~ which actually makes it better because the user can actually understand what he's doing, see the results, and work forward accordingly.  

  How useful is a massive program that takes a Masters Degree for the operator to understand and use, a week to input all the data acceptably ~ versus a program that anybody can use in minutes, and obtain a result in an hour?  How many expert energy auditors are there who can do the number of energy audits needed to make any significant impact on energy usage for the U.S.?  The only way to make progress in reducing building energy use is to have a program like mine that gives decent results quickly and with zero experience required.  Having all the results appear instantly on the screen actualy makes the program fun to operate, and quite insightful and educational.

    The cited method sounds like a carry-over from when stations reported only 
    max/min temperatures.
    If hourly data is available, why wouldn't you just calculate the mean of all 
    the temperatures ?

EP-Quick is now compatible with the revised input language

latest version of EnergyPlus that changed are now supported. 
You can still use EP-Quick on all of the releases of
