Subject: [bldg-sim] DOE2.1E - PVAVS main heating coil
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200501130924.AA2434390pd80000513082@gard.com>

In modeling a PVAVS system in DOE2.1E, I can't get the main heating coil to
be recognized. I have entered a "HEAT-SET-T" (greater than the
"MIN-SUPPLY-T") in "system control" and specified the heating coil capacity,
however, the only heating I'm getting is from the baseboards. I've worked
around this problem before by distributing my main coil capacity into the
preheat, reheat and/or baseboard. Any opinions on the best work-around for
this problem?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200501130842.AA4224812pd80000512969@gard.com>


Expressions of interest in 2nd ESP-r Community Conference

(apologies for cross-posting)

ESRU (Energy Systems Research Unit) are planning the 2nd ESP-r Community
Conference and we would like expressions of interest and comments from
the simulation community so that the next gathering of the ESP-r community
is even better than August of 2003 for users and developers!

Date and Venue

Week of 11 April 2005 at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow Scotland
for two days with optional pre or post conference advanced ESP-r training.

Presentations

We are looking for a range of topics. We would hope for a number of
twenty minute presentations from...

* those who have pushed the boundaries of simulation use in
design/engineering practice.

* those who have used ESP-r in research projects or have an upcoming
project which will feature ESP-r.

* developers on new facilities, functionality or 3rd party links which
have recently been introduced and which are in progress.

* ...tell us your ideas!


Brainstorming

It is good to talk, so lets do some brainstorming on:

* where the community wants to go with ESP-r and how to get there in
terms of talent and funds.

* resources for those developing code.

* what the next generation library of models for training and validation
should include.

* user support - tutorials, exercises, FAQ, and the cookbook.

* ...tell us your ideas!


Technical sessions

Implications of including GNU Fortran extensions in ESP-r (there are
sixty thousand lines being tested as you read this).

Compiling bespoke versions of ESP-r.

Evolving procedures for submitting code and testing of new code and
new models.

 ....tell us your ideas!

Workshops

If there is interest, advanced one day courses might be hosted. We need to
know what topics are of interest so that we can find suitable instructors.
If you want to lead a workshop please forward your ideas.

Costs

Yes it does cost something to organise a conference and to provide
lunches and a dinner so there will be a nominal charge, 150 Pounds for
the conference. Advanced courses, if offered, will be charged at 170
Pounds per day.

Assuming you are using LEED-NC 2.1, daylighting is specifically mentioned
in the Reference guide in EA credit 1, Calculations, subheading "Schedules
of operation."  It appears to be allowed, but you have to actually
simulate it in the model; the base case and proposed case lighting
schedules must still be identical, so no schedule tweaking "estimation."
I assume you're in DOE2.1, so you should have the ability to simulate
daylight harvesting control to some extent.

The main limitations I have hit in simulating daylighting are you cannot
(easily) model daylighting from internal enclosed lightwells (atriums) or
light transmitted through zones, for example to interior zones via
perimeter office doorlites.  If you or any of the other folks on the list
know how to get around this, short of going to EnergyPlus, please share!
I'd love to be wrong on this...

A quick scan of the USGBC CIR's seems to indicate ice storage is a
perfectly valid design option.  The only modeling note is the base case
must use the same electricity rate schedule (and actually reduce the
energy cost, of course).  Mention is even made of an ice storage system
possibly being eligible for an innovation credit (?), but then isn't
everything?

Cheers,

John Weale

Daylighting controls and ice storage can both be applied to increase energy
efficiency above the prerequisite standard (EA prerequisite 2). Therefore, I
believe they could both be included in an effort to obtain points under "EA
Credit 1" (Optimize energy performance).

I am currently working on an building model for a LEED project.  I was
hoping to get some information on whether we can get any benefits in
LEED for the two features listed below.
1)Day lighting control.  The new building will use day lighting
control.  Can we get credit in LEED for this? Should the budget building

2)Ice storage.  ASHRAE 90.1-1999 did not specify how to deal with Ice

Peng Xu,

1. You can definitely take credit for daylighting providing you have the appropriate daylight sensors & dimmers installed (I dont think LEED accepts manual dimming as a credit). 
2. Since the ECB is written to measure the energy COST savings, you could get credit for the ice storage system. You might save energy overall since you are running your chillers at a cooler time of the day, but I'm guessing your biggest savings are in transferring peak loads to the night. Make sure you have the appropriate utility structure defined in your LEED submission.

Hope this helps.

Mohit,
 
In the detailed interface of eQuest you can create a window using the
"LAYER" method.  This allows you to create a layered window with louver,
air and glass layers.  The louver can be internal, external or between
two layers of glass.  DOE 2.2 documentation discusses it in detail.  You
can define the lover properties such as thickness, width, height,
spacing, angle....
 
This is probably the best (and easiest) way to do what you want.
 
Good luck,
 
Mike

I am sure this topic has been beaten to the death! 

I have a 160 feet long and 7 feet tall east facing window defined. It
has multiple small external vertical louvers/fins ~6 feet away from the
plane of the glass along its entire length to provide some shade. But
since it has been defined as one window, can one define a very deep fin
(7 feet tall) of say 200 feet on either one or both sides to have the
same effect as multiple smaller fins or louvers? It will look odd on the
graphic though! But will it have a similar shading effect? 

Or is it best to define it as a fixed or bldg shade with a shading
schedule/transmissivity? The orientation of the building is final so
either fixed or bldg shade should work. 

Thanks.

The eQUEST documentation states that the chiller electric use is calculated
as follows:



Elec(in) = EIR x EIR f(PLR) x EIR f(t1,t2) x Capacity x Capacity f(t1,t2)



However, I have never been able to recreate the hourly values that I get
from eQUEST.  I created an hourly report that shows Corrected EIR, PLR,
CHWT, ECT, Capacity at Current Conditions, EIR Temp Correction Factor, EIR
PLR Correction Factor and Load.  I can recreate the 2 EIR correction factors
from the curve data, but when I multiply by the design EIR, I do not get the
Corrected EIR. When I multiply either the Corrected EIR or my calculated EIR
by the other variables per the equation above I get a different value for
the Electric input. Also, dividing the Load by the Capacity does not give me
the same PLR. Am I missing something?

I use both...my opinion:

eQuest:
 * Great for fast energy estimating...forget about bin calculations
 * Fast/Easy input.  Not much control of room/zone inputs.
 * Great looking output reports
 * Good if you know DOE 2.2 because you can edit in detailed mode
 * Not much good for calculating room/zone loads, sizing equipment
 * Seems to be targeted to people with less simulation experience
 
Trace:
 * Excellent mechanical equipment simulation (especially Trane equipment)
 * Good alternative analysis for mechanical measures
 * Total control of all room/zone characteristics (envelope, 
ventilation, schedules, etc.)
 * Room/Zone input is slow but excellent for calulating room/zone loads 
and sizing equipment
 * Superb telephone support from Trane
 * Seems to be targeted to Energy and Engineering professionals

Trace is a favorite of firms that do HVAC engineering because it can 
also be used for load calculations. However, models derived from Trace 
load calulations are usually to detailed for energy estimating.  Models 
become too complex and slow to calculate results.

Vamshi,
 
You will have the same total heating load in the building whether you heat it with baseboards or with radiant floor heating. So the only real differences you will have to determine by looking at the mechanical design is the total pressure drop in both systems, the temperature difference of the two systems, and the temperature set points of the overall heating loops.  Radiant floor heating is typically designed with a low temperatures heating loop and baseboards with a high temperature heating loop, so you will have to make some approximations if they are served by the same heating loop.

This question has come up several times before and the only workaround that

make the radiant slab also into baseboard.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200501051435.AA3505328pd80000500375@gard.com>

You need to consider whether the two existing/designed radiant systems
might be accurately described in a simulation as one system.

Thermally, is it equivalent?  Or nearly so?

Do you need energy consumption of the systems individually, or are you
analyzing the combined system package as a whole?

If you are trying to optimize or configure the two radiant systems
eQuest might not be your best resource.  However, if you are comparing
this arrangement vs some other system types, or trying to get energy and
cost projections, then the simulation might meet your needs.

TRy again.

How about making your radiant slab a perimeter radiant
system? THAT multiple is allowed in DOE-2/eQUEST.

Hi,

Im modeling a community center in eQUEST. The problem is that two systems, VAV
and radiant slab, are serving one single zone. As far as my knowledge goes one 
zone can have only one system in eQUEST. Is there any way how I can get around
this? I greatly appreciate your input.

Dear Bldg-sim users,

Is there any comparison between TRACE (the energy analysis software 
developed by Trane) and eQUEST, except the difference in price :+)? As I 
know, eQUEST has similar functionality as TRACE but it is free. I think 
there might be some difference in other aspects of these two software that 
make TRACE worthy of its price. Any insight or clue on this issue is 
appreciated.

Hi Christine,

The HVAC system fan is controlled by the fan schedule which you have to
create (or you can use a default from the library).  The schedule is an
on/off or on/off/flag type schedule.  A "1" in the schedule means the fan is
"on" - I use this when the building is occupied -, a "0" means the fan is
off but can cycle on if there is a call for heating or cooling, a flag of
"-999" is used to define an optimum start period.  We usually use the OA
minimum schedule to control the ventilation air and economizer use for each
AHU.  You may want to check the help screens at both the thermal zone level
AND the system level.  These help screens give information on the order of
preference that the program uses if data is entered at more than one level
to control ventilation.  The help screen for the min OA air schedule also
gives good info on several ways to control the ventilation air at the system
level.

Two things I use to control and/or eliminate heating during the summer
months are the "Heat Availability" and Space "Heating Temperature"
Schedules.  In the space temperature schedule, I specify that thermostat
setpoint is 55F from say May through Sept - this will change per type of
building and where it is located at.  Then in the availability schedule I
say that heat is only if the OD temp is below say 65F during fall and spring
months, heat is always available in the winter months and never available
during the summer.  If you want reheat available during the warmer months,
just set heat always available and just use the temperature schedule to
limit the heating energy use just to reheat coils.

As for infiltration, I find it easier to set the infiltration to ACH (air
changes/hour) and use the schedule to determine when infiltration applies.
Generally, we have infiltration on the perimeter of the building only and
even then only during unoccupied periods when the fan is scheduled off.  We
assume that if the fan is on, then the building is pressurized and
infiltration is limited.

CHECK the help screens for each schedule that you use.  The help screens
have useful info that tells the type needed for that particular application
as well as some examples and cautions.

Sorry, I don't have an answer to your last question since I usually use the
Design Development wizard.

I hope this helps.

Subject: [bldg-sim] eQuest 3.52


Hello group,

I am so glad to have found out about this forum!  I hope some of you
will be able to answer my questions.

How does the HVAC system fan (and schedule) work?  Does this unit
control the building air flows/ventilation rates?  I wasn't able to
turn off or reduce space heating during the summer months.  Is there a
place to resolve this?

The infiltration rates appear to be controlled by two inputs -- air
change (per hour?) and cfm/ft^2.  However, when one value is
specified, it seems as though the program shoudl be calculating the
other, just because it has the information such as building volume and
square footage to do so.  The end reports yield different values when
one or the other or both are entered, even though they should be
dependent on each other.  Is there a way to input the building
infiltration to ensure accurate end calculations?

In the Schematic Wizard, I am allowed to specify values for both
nonresidential and residential domestic water heating in two different
windows.  Do these specifications result from the same heating unit?
For example, I am able to input two different tank capacities, but am
uncertain whether this means I have two tanks or one.

Thank you so much.  Your help is greatly appreciated.
Christine

Hello again,
 
The tables do include all counties, since any county not included in the
"except" would automatically be included in the zone referenced. (e.g.,
Florida, all counties are in zone 2 except Zone 1 contains Broward,
Dade, and Monroe.)  Maybe I am misunderstanding your original question.

Larry,
Thank you very much for your quick response. I had looked at Table B-1.
My understanding was that this Table does not list all the counties, it
only lists a State and if some of the counties of that state do not fall
in a particular zone or fall in more than one zone then  it lists the as
"except" category. E.g. none of the counties or cities from the
Massachusetts is listed. I was specifically looking if someone has a
listing of counties and associated climate zones.

Hi,

 

Does anyone know if there is a compiled list of US cities associated with
DOE Climatic Zones (for all the 8 zones)? Any help would be highly
appreciated.

 

Thanks

The eight climate zones are listed by "COUNTY" (not by city) in Table
301.1 and Figure 301.1 of the IECC 2004 document and in Table B-1 and
Figure B-1 of the ASHRAE Standard 901.-2004.  I assume these are the
same as "DOE Climatic Zones."

Architectural Energy Corporation is pleased to announce a VisualDOE 4.0
and LEED training seminar on April 20-22, 2005 in San Francisco.

The seminar includes two days focused on DOE-2.1E, the VisualDOE
interface, VisualDOE 4.0 new features, and general energy simulation
skills. The third day covers LEED energy savings calculations for green
buildings. The LEED module covers LEED-NC 2.1 as well as proposed
calculation methods for LEED-NC 2.2.

No prior energy modeling experience is required, but a good
understanding of building systems is very helpful.

VisualDOE 4.0 is available at a discount to training attendees.  However
a free one-month license for VisualDOE 4.0 is included with the
training.

An advanced training program for experienced VisualDOE users is being
considered on April 25 and 26, 2005 in San Francisco. This program will
cover advanced topics of DOE-2.1E, VisualDOE 4.0, and simulation skills
for complicated energy conservation measures. If you are interested in
the advanced training program, please contact us ASAP.

For questions, please contact us via email vdoetraining at archenergy.com
or phone (415) 957-1977 ext 111.

Try this one:
Open ".pd2" file of the project in a text editor (notepad/note tab lite).
Check the coordinates of 'ClippingRange', 'FocalPoint' &
'Position'...If any of these coordinates dont seem alright then modify
to some positive values...save the file and then open the project in
eQUEST.

Dear all,

I was wondering if anyone knows how to change the roof shape in
eQuest.  I'm actually trying to create a hole, so that I can extend a
tower within the building to go above the roof.

Thanks so much,
Christine Lee

We are developing a real time web based energy simulation program that can 
be used in the early stages of a building design to easily and rapidly 
assess the impact of major design decisions.

A beta version is freely available as a real-time simulator on the web at : 
designadvisor.mit.edu
Note: www.designadvisor.mit.edu does not work

The program requires a PC with Internet Explorer or Firefox

The web suite of building energy simulators that model energy, comfort, and 
daylighting performance, and give estimates of the long-term cost of 
utilities. The simulations restrict flexibility in order to offer users 
greater ease-of-use and speed. The tool can be quickly mastered by 
non-technical designers, and runs fast enough to allow them the scope to 
experiment with many different versions of a design during a single 
sitting. The immediate feedback that the site provides makes it useful in 
the conceptual phase of design, when architects cannot afford to invest 
large amounts of time to rule out any particular idea. The emphasis of the 
energy model is on the envelope system of the building, and includes 
simulations of high-technology windows such as double-skin facades. 
Energy-load estimates are based on a library of hourly climate data for 30 
different cities around the world and include transient interactions with 
thermal mass within the building.. Lighting simulations are carried out 
using a rapid radiosity calculation method. Hybrid and natural ventilation 
strategies are evaluated for energy saving and comfort conditions.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200501281555.AA5506593pd80000537192@gard.com>

I've further question with regard to the simulation of GSHP in eQUEST:
 
In order to evaluate the design of a GSHP, we need to know the water side loop temperature, ideally after multi-years operation. But, the standard eQUEST output doesn't provide these information. Does DOE 2.2 calculate the loop temperature of a GSHP? If so, is there any clue of getting the loop temperature from eQUEST?

 Thanks,

 Xiaobing

Dear bldg-sim users:
 
I have two questions with regard to eQUEST. Is there anyone can help me out?
 
(1). As I know, eQUEST has the capability of simulating GSHP, but it has to be done in the detailed mode. I'm wondering whether there is any documentation, or even better, example to show how to build a GSHP simulation in eQUEST?
 
(2). Can eQUEST report hourly zone loads and coil loads? If so, how to do it? 
 
Thanks in advance,

New Release: eQUEST version 3.54 for Win 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP. This version contains the standard eQUEST release only. (posting date: 1/27/2005, ~19.5 MB)  You may uninstall versions older than the 3.54 release version before installing this new version; you may retain the 3.52 or 3.53 version (by allowing this new release to be installed into a different directory.)  The main differences between 3.52 and 3.54 are: a new version of the DWG/DXF import capability that supports all current format versions and allows multiple drawings to be connected separately to each wizard shell or floor plan; updates to the Title 24 rule processing (final such update prior to ACM Certification expected next month); inclusion of the latest DOE-2.2 (version 44c) which includes bug fixes and new features (such as demand controlled ventilation DCV.) For more information visit http://DOE2.com/equest 

New Release: DOE-2.2 version 44c for Win 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP. This archive contains the standard DOE-2.2 release only; includes a simple Windows executable, winDOE2, to run DOE-2 in its DLL format (same DLL's used by eQUEST) as well as the "DOS box" (.exe) batch version. The archive also contains readable program source (for BDL, simulation components, as well as support programs and data bases) and developer's libraries (allowing third party developers to incorporate DOE-2.2 into their applications.) You can also download the DOE-2.2 Manuals to use this program effectively and there are is fixed bug list for version 44c; for new features see the DOE-2.2 Manuals volume 6. (Version DOE-2.2-044c posting date: 1/27/2005, ~9 MB) For more information visit http://DOE2.com/DOE2 

DOE-2.2 New features: http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol6-NewFeatures.pdf

DOE-2.2-44c bug fix list: http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/Bugfixes-044c.pdf

New Release: D2comply 3.54 - The DOE-2.2 based California Title 24 "compliance only" engine; update to the version submitted for certification by the California Energy Commission as a non-residential ACM on 10/13/2004.  This is the DOE-2.2 component contained within eQUEST 3.54 to perform Title 24 compliance analysis; once certified, third party developers can use this package to build additional certified tools. Download D2comply for compliance only analysis; for full standard DOE-2.2 use you should obtain a standard release version of DOE-2.2 (above information) NOT this version. D2comply accepts any valid DOE-2.2 BDL file that includes all required compliance information (see DOE-2.2 Manual Volume 5) and performs Title 24 compliance analysis. If you have eQUEST 3.54 you do not need this program. (posting date: 1/27/2005, ~7 MB) For more information visit http://DOE2.com/equest or http://DOE2.com/DOE2

Jon --
I support your effort, the proposed database promises to be extremely useful.

However, I have a suggestion for how time zone is handled.  A time zone is 
not just a time difference from GMT, it also embodies politically 
determined rules for how daylight savings is handled.  These rules are 
required in order to accurately relate local time to solar time during a 
simulation.  There are about 75 time zones currently defined, I believe.

Microsoft has a coding system to identify and describe time zones (which 
may derive from Unix or some other source).

In the 2005 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals weather update, the time zone 
is identified for all locations and the new chapter will have a table 
describing them.

Also, you might consider adding 1 (or even 2) additional station ID fields 
that could be used for national station IDs in addition to the WMO#.  US 
locations often have a so-called WBAN ID, for example.  You would probably 
want both the IDName and the ID, so a US location would say

*place,Anniston,722287,WBAN,xxxxx,33.58N,85.85W,NAE,186,99.11,-

where "NAE" is the time zone code replacing the time diff from GMT.

I also recommend that you compare notes with Didier Thevenard (the 
contractor who constructed the updated tables for the 2005 HOF).  He has 
accumulated much painful experience trying to unambiguously identify 
stations on a world-wide basis and would probably have additional 
suggestions.  Didier's Email = numlog at shaw.ca

The 2005 ASHRAE Handbook CD will have design data for
more than 4000 locations throughout the world.  It will include
the time zone data (more than 70 variants worldwide) and
state/province information in USA/Canada but not elsewhere.

Sorry for any cross-postings.

I am compiling a list of the attributes of places which is extending
published information from ASHRAE and EnergyPlus sources.  It differs
in that sites are grouped by state/region/provinces and there are
additional fields for the time zone difference with GMT and whether
there is an existing EPW climate file for the place.

The reason for this how easy it is to get such information wrong. How
many of us remember that China is one timezone but has weather
stations from 75E to 129E so noon clock time and noon solar time
can be seriously different? There are literally dozens of variants of
time offsets to be found so Lat & Long is not always a reliable guide.

Hopefully the contents of this list is a step to an evolving standard
tool data repository that Dru Crawley, Michael Donn and I are
planning (details to be published in the upcoming IBPSA conference).

A sample of the file is included below just to get you oriented:

*place,Anchorage (Elemendorf),702720,61.25N,149.80W,-9,65,100.55,-  ....

For places like Brazil and the collection of countries in and around
Russia it is not clear to an outsider, the time zone & province of the
place (which often is named after some airport or lighthouse).

If anyone knows about provinces and timezones in the following entries
I would welcome the information. The missing bits are marked with an x.

If anyone knows of state/region/provinces then you could also insert a
*region,xx
where appropriate and shuffle the *place entries. If anyone wants to
proof other countries data I would be happy to email the relevant portions
of the file.

Email any corrections/contributions/discussion to jon at esru.strath.ac.uk

Many thanks,

 ....

For places like Brazil and the collection of countries in and around 
Russia it is not clear to an outsider, the time zone & province of the 
place (which often is named after some airport or lighthouse).

If anyone knows about provinces and timezones in the following entries
I would welcome the information. The missing bits are marked with an x. 

If anyone knows of state/region/provinces then you could also insert a
*region,xx
where appropriate and shuffle the *place entries. If anyone wants to
proof other countries data I would be happy to email the relevant portions
of the file. 

Email any corrections/contributions/discussion to jon at esru.strath.ac.uk

Many thanks, 
Jon Hand, IBPSA-Scotland

Subject: [bldg-sim] Occupancy Sensors
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200501211629.AA2923640pd80000526512@gard.com>

CTG Energetics recently prepared an example LEED-NC v2.1 EAc1 submittal
for the USGBC in November 2004. In this documentation the example
project adopted a 20% LPD credit for occupant sensor controls in private
offices, which is based on a CIR submitted 12/2/2003 and ruled upon
2/4/2004 (There are studies supporting a wide range of savings (20% to
43%) in private office.  Savings in open office environment would be
significantly less.)

So, it seems that 20% LPD adjustment for private office is acceptable by
USGBC.  Hope this helps.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Occupancy Sensors

Hi Bill-
I do not have direct experince obtaining LEED credit for Occupancy
Sensors, but I too am currently looking into this issue for a LEED
project.

As you note, It's my understanding that USGBC has not yet formally
adopted either 90.1-2001, or addendum e to 90.1-2001. (Rumor has it that
they will update directly to 90.1-2004 when they do update.)

I interpret the table G3.8 in addendum e to 90.1-2001 to show the
suggested adjustments to proposed L.P.D levels. I agree that the
language of:
'automatic lighting controls in *addition* to those required  for
minimum code compliance.' is very confusing. However, I think that
adjustments are suggested according to the table listings based on use
type either " Non 24-hour use and Less than or equal to 5,000 sq.ft." OR
"All Other Spaces".
My reading is that even though automatic shutoff controls are listed as
a mandatory measure for "All other" spaces in 90.1 1999 section 9.2,
that the listed L.P.D. adjustments for installation of either
programmable timing control, Occupancy Sensor, or Both are allowed.
(Note that the listed adjustment under "All Other", " Programmable
timing control" is zero
adjustment.)

Still , keep in mind that addendum e is not offically adopted by USGBC
yet.

For now, I'm working from 90.1-1999 and the published USGBC CIRs. There
is a Credit Interpretation Request that you have access to on the USGBC
web site if your organization is a USGBC member. I've copied the text
below in case some list members do not have access to the CIRs.(see
below.) The ruling on Measure 1 is the pertinent one, which states
adjustment of L.P.D. may be an acceptable means of approximating
Occupancy sensors without modifying the schedules between proposed and
baseline.

I have anecdotally heard that other projects used an adjustment of 20%
in the proposed L.P.D. for an office use and received credit. I'm
planning on trying this adjustment for the model I'm working on (since
it's 5% more than the addendum e listing).

Best wishes,

      12/2/2003 -  Credit Interpretation Request
      Four energy-efficiency measures, which are not covered under
ASHRAE
90.1-1999 or the LEED Energy Modeling Protocol, are outlined below for a
106,000 square foot chemistry research laboratory building with numerous
lab fume hoods. These four measures generate significant energy cost
savings.

      Based on the following USGBC Credit Rulings posted on 06/07/2001,
06/27/2001 and 01/20/2002:
      "To document savings for [energy reducing strategies not covered
under ASHRAE 90.1-1999 or the LEED Energy Modeling Protocol], follow the
ECB Exceptional Calculation Method. See Section 11.5 of the ASHRAE 90.1
User''s Manual. Under the ECM, schedule variations may be used as a
basis of engineering calculations for discrete measures that are
precluded by the reference standard or the LEED EMP."

      We assume each energy-efficiency measure listed below should be
modeled discreetly and "exceptional" savings must be subtracted from the
Design Energy Cost in the same fashion as renewable energy.

      Based on the USGBC''s LEED Credit Ruling posted on 11/09/2001:
      "It is acceptable to use [the same simulation tool that is used
for the base simulation] to triangulate on projected savings for
discrete measures that can ONLY be approximated through schedule
manipulations."

      We assume that these Exceptional Calculation Methods (ECM''s) are
to be performed using the same simulation tool that is used for the base
simulation.

      For the first three energy-efficiency measures listed below, a
corresponding reduction in energy use can only be approximated by
altering the Base Building schedules (based on sound engineering
judgement).
Therefore, we hereby request preliminary approval for the first three
energy saving measures listed. Hourly schedules for lighting power
density and fumehood exhaust in both the Design Building and Base
Building are available for each case for review.

      1. Lighting Occupancy Sensors
      When motion and/or infrared sensors determine a space to be
unoccupied for a period of at least 15 minutes (adjustable), lighting
within the space is automatically reduced to minimum levels.

      2. Fumehood Zone Presence Sensors
      When locally mounted infrared sensors determine the zone in front
of a particular fumehood to be unoccupied for a period of at least 15
minutes (adjustable), laboratory exhaust quantities shall be adjusted to
reduce sash velocity from 100 fpm to 70 fpm for that individual
fumehood.

      3. Fumehood Occupancy Sensors
      Similar to Lighting Occupancy Sensors, when motion and/or infrared
sensors determine a space to be unoccupied for a period of at least 15
minutes (adjustable), laboratory exhaust quantities shall be adjusted to
reduce the minimum total room air change rate from 12 ACH to 6 ACH.
      Additionally, we request preliminary approval for the following
energy saving measure, to be modeled as noted below:

      4. Laboratory Air Cascading
      A portion of the makeup air required for fumehood exhaust shall be
delivered to offices and support areas and then "cascaded" to labs via a
ducted transfer air system. Ducts shall be sized so that the external
pressure drop realized along the path of the transfer air shall be a
maximum of 0.05" w.g.

      The Exceptional Calculation Method proposed would compare two
analogous air-handling system (one for office/support areas and one for
the laboratories), by breaking the air-handling system into two discreet
pieces, to facilitate comparison of the Base and Design building models.

      2/4/2004 -  Ruling
      ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURE 1:
      It appears that altering the schedule to approximate energy
savings from the lighting occupancy sensors (as described) fits within
the context of the 90.1 Exceptional Calculation Method. When calculating
the energy savings associated with these measures for EAc1, it is
necessary to justify both the proposed and budget schedules for occupied
hours and provide detailed space by space usage schedules that are both
reasonable and defensible. The budget and proposed building should have
the same lighting schedules for regularly unoccupied periods.
Additionally, it may be possible to arrive at a reasonable estimate by
manipulating the lighting power density in the proposed and design case.

      ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES 2 AND 3:
      Fumehoods are considered process loads, which are not applicable
to EA Prerequisite 2 and EA Credit 1. The appropriate treatment of
laboratory process loads is the subject of numerous LEED CIRs. Please
refer to the EAp2 credit ruling dated 12/15/03 and EAc1.1 credit ruling
dated 12/15/03 for a discussion of the appropriate treatment of ASHRAE
90.1 non-regulated energy loads in EAc1. To maintain consistency with
the referenced standard, optimization of non-regulated energy loads is
recognized by award of an Innovation in Design (ID) credit rather than
award of EAc1 points.
      For ID credit calculations, it appears that altering the schedule
to approximate energy savings from the fumehood zone presence sensors
and the fumehood occupancy sensors (as described) fits within the
context of the
90.1 Exceptional Calculation Method. When calculating the energy savings
associated with these measures for ID credit award, it is necessary to
justify both the proposed and budget fumehood schedules for occupied
hours and provide detailed laboratory usage schedules that are both
reasonable and defensible. The budget and proposed building should have
the same ventilation rates for regularly unoccupied periods. If any of
the zones are internally load driven, the potential energy savings from
reducing the ventilation requirements must account for the possibility
of higher ventilation rate requirements imposed by internal loads.

      ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURE 4:
      The ECM proposal does not contain sufficient detail from which to
make an informed determination. It is likely that it will be allowed
during LEED certification review if ASHRAE 90.1 Section 11.5 guidance is
followed (i.e., provide theoretical and empirical information verifying
accuracy). Also consider this alternative approach: the lab could be
modeled as a 100% outside air system for the baseline case but as a
recirculating system for the proposed design. The outside air quantities
and relief quantities for the office space would be modeled as
identical. The fan power and schedule would be identical for the supply
and exhaust systems for laboratory and office areas. To model the
cascading system in the proposed design, the laboratory system
recirculates the volume of relief air that would be cascaded from the
office space to the laboratory space. The total amount of outside air
drawn into the building is reduced in the proposed design by the amount
of relief air that is cascaded from the office occupancy to the
laboratory. The outside air ventilation volumes and exhaust volumes are
identical for the two cases (the outside air discrepancy is due to a
make-up air, rather than a ventilation air requirement).

mandatory measure for "All other" spaces in 90.1 1999 section 9.2, that the
listed L.P.D. adjustments for installation of either programmable timing
control, Occupancy Sensor, or Both are allowed. (Note that the listed
adjustment under "All Other", " Programmable timing control" is zero
adjustment.)

Still , keep in mind that addendum e is not offically adopted by USGBC yet.

For now, I'm working from 90.1-1999 and the published USGBC CIRs. There is a
Credit Interpretation Request that you have access to on the USGBC web site
if your organization is a USGBC member. I've copied the text below in case
some list members do not have access to the CIRs.(see below.) The ruling on
Measure 1 is the pertinent one, which states adjustment of L.P.D. may be an
acceptable means of approximating Occupancy sensors without modifying the
schedules between proposed and baseline.

I have anecdotally heard that other projects used an adjustment of 20% in
the proposed L.P.D. for an office use and received credit. I'm planning on
trying this adjustment for the model I'm working on (since it's 5% more than
the addendum e listing).

      12/2/2003 -  Credit Interpretation Request
      Four energy-efficiency measures, which are not covered under ASHRAE
90.1-1999 or the LEED Energy Modeling Protocol, are outlined below for a
106,000 square foot chemistry research laboratory building with numerous lab
fume hoods. These four measures generate significant energy cost savings.

      Based on the following USGBC Credit Rulings posted on 06/07/2001,
06/27/2001 and 01/20/2002:
      "To document savings for [energy reducing strategies not covered under
ASHRAE 90.1-1999 or the LEED Energy Modeling Protocol], follow the ECB
Exceptional Calculation Method. See Section 11.5 of the ASHRAE 90.1 User''s
Manual. Under the ECM, schedule variations may be used as a basis of
engineering calculations for discrete measures that are precluded by the
reference standard or the LEED EMP."

      We assume each energy-efficiency measure listed below should be
modeled discreetly and "exceptional" savings must be subtracted from the
Design Energy Cost in the same fashion as renewable energy.

      Based on the USGBC''s LEED Credit Ruling posted on 11/09/2001:
      "It is acceptable to use [the same simulation tool that is used for
the base simulation] to triangulate on projected savings for discrete
measures that can ONLY be approximated through schedule manipulations."

      We assume that these Exceptional Calculation Methods (ECM''s) are to
be performed using the same simulation tool that is used for the base
simulation.

      For the first three energy-efficiency measures listed below, a
corresponding reduction in energy use can only be approximated by altering
the Base Building schedules (based on sound engineering judgement).
Therefore, we hereby request preliminary approval for the first three energy
saving measures listed. Hourly schedules for lighting power density and
fumehood exhaust in both the Design Building and Base Building are available
for each case for review.

      1. Lighting Occupancy Sensors
      When motion and/or infrared sensors determine a space to be unoccupied
for a period of at least 15 minutes (adjustable), lighting within the space
is automatically reduced to minimum levels.

      2. Fumehood Zone Presence Sensors
      When locally mounted infrared sensors determine the zone in front of a
particular fumehood to be unoccupied for a period of at least 15 minutes
(adjustable), laboratory exhaust quantities shall be adjusted to reduce sash
velocity from 100 fpm to 70 fpm for that individual fumehood.

      3. Fumehood Occupancy Sensors
      Similar to Lighting Occupancy Sensors, when motion and/or infrared
sensors determine a space to be unoccupied for a period of at least 15
minutes (adjustable), laboratory exhaust quantities shall be adjusted to
reduce the minimum total room air change rate from 12 ACH to 6 ACH.
      Additionally, we request preliminary approval for the following energy
saving measure, to be modeled as noted below:

      4. Laboratory Air Cascading
      A portion of the makeup air required for fumehood exhaust shall be
delivered to offices and support areas and then "cascaded" to labs via a
ducted transfer air system. Ducts shall be sized so that the external
pressure drop realized along the path of the transfer air shall be a maximum
of 0.05" w.g.

      The Exceptional Calculation Method proposed would compare two
analogous air-handling system (one for office/support areas and one for the
laboratories), by breaking the air-handling system into two discreet pieces,
to facilitate comparison of the Base and Design building models.

      2/4/2004 -  Ruling
      ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURE 1:
      It appears that altering the schedule to approximate energy savings
from the lighting occupancy sensors (as described) fits within the context
of the 90.1 Exceptional Calculation Method. When calculating the energy
savings associated with these measures for EAc1, it is necessary to justify
both the proposed and budget schedules for occupied hours and provide
detailed space by space usage schedules that are both reasonable and
defensible. The budget and proposed building should have the same lighting
schedules for regularly unoccupied periods. Additionally, it may be possible
to arrive at a reasonable estimate by manipulating the lighting power
density in the proposed and design case.

      ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES 2 AND 3:
      Fumehoods are considered process loads, which are not applicable to EA
Prerequisite 2 and EA Credit 1. The appropriate treatment of laboratory
process loads is the subject of numerous LEED CIRs. Please refer to the EAp2
credit ruling dated 12/15/03 and EAc1.1 credit ruling dated 12/15/03 for a
discussion of the appropriate treatment of ASHRAE 90.1 non-regulated energy
loads in EAc1. To maintain consistency with the referenced standard,
optimization of non-regulated energy loads is recognized by award of an
Innovation in Design (ID) credit rather than award of EAc1 points.
      For ID credit calculations, it appears that altering the schedule to
approximate energy savings from the fumehood zone presence sensors and the
fumehood occupancy sensors (as described) fits within the context of the
90.1 Exceptional Calculation Method. When calculating the energy savings
associated with these measures for ID credit award, it is necessary to
justify both the proposed and budget fumehood schedules for occupied hours
and provide detailed laboratory usage schedules that are both reasonable and
defensible. The budget and proposed building should have the same
ventilation rates for regularly unoccupied periods. If any of the zones are
internally load driven, the potential energy savings from reducing the
ventilation requirements must account for the possibility of higher
ventilation rate requirements imposed by internal loads.

      ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURE 4:
      The ECM proposal does not contain sufficient detail from which to make
an informed determination. It is likely that it will be allowed during LEED
certification review if ASHRAE 90.1 Section 11.5 guidance is followed (i.e.,
provide theoretical and empirical information verifying accuracy). Also
consider this alternative approach: the lab could be modeled as a 100%
outside air system for the baseline case but as a recirculating system for
the proposed design. The outside air quantities and relief quantities for
the office space would be modeled as identical. The fan power and schedule
would be identical for the supply and exhaust systems for laboratory and
office areas. To model the cascading system in the proposed design, the
laboratory system recirculates the volume of relief air that would be
cascaded from the office space to the laboratory space. The total amount of
outside air drawn into the building is reduced in the proposed design by the
amount of relief air that is cascaded from the office occupancy to the
laboratory. The outside air ventilation volumes and exhaust volumes are
identical for the two cases (the outside air discrepancy is due to a make-up
air, rather than a ventilation air requirement).

Bill-

We have received credit for occupancy sensors in LEED projects when they are
submitted under the Exceptional Calculation Method.  This requires an
additional energy model run.  First, we run the proposed and ASHRAE models
without the occupancy sensors and use this data for the Post-processed data
and the ECB table.  Then we run a proposed with the credit for occupancy
sensors.  The difference between the proposed and the proposed w/ occ
sensors is detailed on an extra line at the end of the ECB table (like for
renewable energy).  Our submittal includes a narrative detailing how the
credits were calculated and applied to the last run.

Mohit-

Your conditioned and plenum spaces would have to be modified in the
"Detailed" mode such that any roof with skylights is attached to the
conditioned space and not the plenum space.  The plenum would then have
interior walls as boundaries separating the plenum from the conditioned
space with the conditioned space defined as the "space next to".

Good luck,

Mark,

" [...] plug loads in higher education facilities have been relatively 
constant the last five years. The basis is that even though there are 
(probably) more computers on campus, the improved efficiency has offset the 
higher numbers so net growth on load has been negligible.  Does anyone know 
of any data or studies that may support or refute this? Thanks in advance."

You may want to look up the following study:

1093-RP, "Compilation of Diversity Factors Schedules for Energy and Cooling 
Load Calculations" 
Bass Abushakra, David Claridge and Jeff Haberl of Texas A&M University. 
abstract: "The results of this project, available on CD-ROM, compile a library 
of schedules and diversity factors for energy and cooling loads in office 
buildings. Forty-six diversity factors were derived from measured data from 
32 office buildings. The results are compatible with DOE-2, BLAST and Energy 
Plus simulation programs." (taken from ASHRAE web site)

The study is very recent (2004), so you could compare the updated plug load 
profiles against whatever you have on hand. If memory serves me right (don't 
actually have the 1093 documents in front of me as I'm writing this), updated 
plug load diversity factors during peak hours in offices WERE lower than 
what's used by default for compliance purposes in Canada (i.e. energy code; 
incentive programs, etc.), e.g. 90% in the MNECB ... Of course, you'd have to 
compare nominal load densities as well, but overall I think your hunch is 
right.

You may also want to look up the following for a more detailed view on IT 
equipment load comparison:

Gerald,

You can accomplish this by modifying your heating/cooling set point
schedule. You can input the setback (or setup) temperatures for the
nighttime hours. You cannot use Wizard mode for this and you will need to
use Detailed Edit mode. I hope it helps.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200501191458.AA5820671pd80000522593@gard.com>

Here's a need to go beyond the standard DOE2.1E fatal error-type limitations
to simulate a real situation.

 

Does anyone in DOE2 Land know how to get DOE2.1E to allow the chilled water
coil leaving air temperature to be 35 degrees F for special space
dehumidification requirements?  I've specified in PLANT input a hermetic
centrifugal chiller with a cooling tower to deliver 32 degree (the minimum
allowed) chilled water.  I've specified no piping losses in PLANT, and a
coil bypass factor of 0.01 with a blow-through fan and a chilled water coil
water-side delta-t of 7 degrees (the minimum allowed) in SYSTEMS.  Also,
DOE2.1Ev132 will not allow me to specify a coil chilled water supply
temperature below 35 degrees under any circumstances that I know of.  Then
the code requires at least a 6 degree coil water-to-air temperature
differential, which limits me to a 41 degrees F coil leaving air
temperature.  I know that glycol chillers can go lower than 32 degrees,
chilled water can be delivered at below 35 degrees and beefier coils can
beat a 6 degree differential, but can DOE2 be coaxed somehow to simulate
these extremes?

 

Sincerely,

eQUEST resultsSamuel-

I usually check the SV-A reports in the sim viewer to see the sizes of the
air-side HVAC systems from auto-sizing.  Report SS-A will give you monthly
and annual peak loads per system.

Water-side system sizes can be seen in the PS-H reports.  I have noticed
that water-side systems (chilled water and boilers) tend to have major over
sizing when using auto-size.  The plant equipment is auto- sized assuming
every coil on the loop is operating concurrently.

  Dear bldg-sim users,

  I'm trying to size the HVAC equipment in a office in different situations,
bu t I get contradictorial results. Which is the best procedure in such
calculations in equest? Is it enough just selecting "auto-size" in package
HVAC equipment? Where can we find the load calculation results sheet in
D2SimViewer?

  When adding a layer of insulation to an old non-insulated dwelling (with
high inertial mass), I get that the savings in heating are not enough to
compensate the rise in cooling demand (and electricity bill). I'm a bit
confused there because in my understanding adding insulation would cut down
heating deamand, and shoul had little or no effect on cooling season. Had
anyone crossed over with the same problem? If anyone had a paper on the
subject, I'll appreciate any information.

I am now getting into analysis of CHP technologies and was wondering if
anyone has recommendations about software tools (without having to input
extensive building information). Any thoughts on Building Energy
Analyzer? Also, there seems to be a BCHP screening tool by ORNL/DOE, but
I can't seem to find any info about it or how to get it. Any pointers
are appreciated.

Mickey,

Check out the references below.  Unfortunately, all the studies of occupant use of operable windows have all taken place in naturally ventilated buildings.  We know anecdotally that people use their windows differently if they have mechanical cooling, primarily because there is no thermal feedback that prompts people to open their windows.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Operable Windows
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200501181520.AA2026515pd80000520538@gard.com>

Greetings,

I am working on an energy study for a building considering installing operable windows in the offices which would be tied into the VAV boxes.  The sequence calls for the office VAV box to fully close when the office window is opened.  We think this a good sequence, but the problem is quantifying the potential savings.  

Does anyone know of any studies that deal with office occupant's tendencies toward opening windows? (How often during various outside air conditions windows are left open?)  Any links to published studies or techniques that people have used in the past would be appreciated.
 
Thanks,

We are in the middle of putting together a comparison paper
among 9 simulation programs--based on information provided
by the developers.  The tools include (in alphabetical order):
BLAST, DOE-2.1E, Energy-10,  EnergyPlus, eQUEST, ESP-r,
HAP, TRACE and TRNSYS.  The key parts of the paper will
be abstracted for a paper for the Building Simulation conference
in Montreal in August.

We have received and compiled first level of information on all the
tools except HAP (which we expect any day).  The comparison
focuses on the technical capabilities of the tools.  A separate section
focuses on user interfaces and other unique features.

Once the comparison paper (currently 24 pages long) has been reviewed
again by the developers and by outside reviewers, we can make it
available to interested users.

Peter,

 

The ES-F report summarizes just the blocks and ratchet components of the
utility rate structure.  If they aren't matching, then you have some
non-block costs included in the definition of the utility structure.

 

For example, 

 

"XXX" = UTILITY-RATE    

   TYPE             = ELECTRICITY

   MONTH-CHGS       = ( 110 )

   ENERGY-CHG       = 0.01836

   DEMAND-CHGS      = ( 3.84 )

   BLOCK-CHARGES    = ( "On Peak Summer", "Intermediate Summer", 

         "Off Peak Summer", "On Peak Winter", "Intermediate Winter", 

         "Off Peak Winter", "Demand Gen Summer", "Demand Gen Winter" )

   DEMAND-INTERVAL  = 30

  

With monthly energy usage of 22,476 kWh and 81.2 kW, the total energy
costs are $1750, but the ES-F reports $915.  This is due the $110
monthly charge, the additional $0.01836/kwh fixed consumption charge
($413 = 0.01836 * 22476), and the additional 3.84/kW fixed demand charge
($312 = 3.84 * 81.2). Thus, the ES-E total of $1750 = 110 + 413 + 312 +
915 

 

Hope this makes sense.

Does anyone have any experience with utility rate applications for
electricity? We are simulating the cost comparison of building having a
traditional chilled water plant and boilers against a plant having three
cogeneration units providing heat for an absorption chiller. The results
shown in report ES-E do not match report ES-F. The total charges should
be the same or am I missing something?

Dear all,
Is there a possibility that a Chiller;Absorption can use hot water 
as generator heat source in energyplus?
Best Regards

Subject: [bldg-sim] DOE2.1E - PVAVS main heating coil
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200501142054.AA5450765pd80000515544@gard.com>

In 2.2 you can specify HEAT-CONTROL = COLDEST (in addition to HEAT-SET-T) which I believe will give you what you want.  Main heating coil will temper air to the point where it can still cool the warmest zone and then trim heaters / reheaters / baseboards will do the rest.  It's een a while since I worked with 2.1E so not sure if same control is available.
Regards,
Graham

This is one of my favorite peeves with DOE2.1E.  in a VAVS or PVAVS the 
heating coil does not work if you specify COOL-CONTROL = WARMEST.  In 
practice an actual VAV system with a heating coil will maintain the minimum 
supply T.  This is not a problem in California where the code for the 
systems portion of DOE2.1E was developed.  If you set COOL-CONTROL = 
CONSTANT or COOL-CONTROL = RESET and define an outdoor temperature reset 
schedule then the heating coil works as expected.  I have not been able to 
convince anyone to fix the code for COOL-CONTROL = WARMEST and I have been 
trying for a number of years.

The work around is to define a PREHEAT-T at a couple of degrees below the 
MIN-SUPPLY-T.  There tends to be more heating and cooling with this work 
around than you would expect but it is better than using COOL-CONTROL = 
CONSTANT.

I wonder if this problem has been fixed in DOE2.2?
