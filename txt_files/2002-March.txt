Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Modelling DDC vs Pnuematic Controls
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200203271402.AA024217pd80000133496@gard.com>

I was wondering how other people approach this modeling scenario.

You have an existing building with a constant volume re-heat system all
Controlled pneumatically.

You want to estimate savings in an EEM for installing DDC controls on the
air 
Handler cooling coil and all re-heat coils.

How would you model this? We have been debating two methods.

The first strategy:

		In the baseline model set the heating setpoint to 70 degs
and the cooling setpoint to 74 degs.
		Then to model the DDC in the measure set the heating
setpoint to 69 degs and the cooling setpoint to 75 degs.

		The argument goes that pneumatic thermostats are not as
accurate as digital temperature sensors and the savings
		would be expected from the reduced cooling and heating load.

The second strategy:

		In the baseline model set the zone level throttling range to
4 deg. and the cool coil control range to 4 deg.
		Then in the DDC model, set the zone level throttling range
to 2 deg. and the cool coil control range to 2 deg.

		The value you would set the DDC throttling ranges are
arbitrary and can be bumped higher or lower based on operating conditions.

		This strategy, I feel reflects the "tighter" control the DDC
would offer over pneumatics.


These strategies only address controls at the coiling and heating coil
level.

I would be greatly interested in how others view this problem.

Thanks for your input!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200203261538.AA380468pd10000133223@gard.com>

I am currently working on a 'green' laboratory building for US Govt - we don't use DOE in any form so excuse my ignorance - our simulation programs (ATAS/BTAS) allow us to model cooling and also dehumidification as separate to exhaust/airflow/pressure needs - we model a "heat neutral" (i.e. air @ "design room air temperature & humidity") supply air that tracks the exhaust and a conventional system that controls sensible & and another that controls latent gains - then we re-combine these airflows. It is often an outworking of that approach that if separate airflows were provided as part of the design, there should be significant energy savings....costs bit up front though...from a modelling point-of-view we are only allowed 8 different day types and 8 different events per day - should be enough -

cheers, and I do think Russell Crowe should have got the Oscar for A Beautiful Mind!

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Modeling VAV Exhaust in PowerDOE



We are trying to use PowerDOE to model Variable Air Volume Exhaust in the
laboratory spaces in a five-story engineering building.  At the same time we
are trying to adhere to the ECB in ASHRAE 90.1, which does not allow
changing schedules.  We have tried to model it by giving these spaces their
own dedicated VAV unit that supplies 100% outside air (so the exhaust will
track the supply), and has a minimum of 4 air changes per hour of outside
air (per fire code).  This seems reasonable, but does not take into account
the instances when a fume hood is completely open and the exhaust rate
exceeds the required supply for the space.

Does anyone have any experience with VAV exhaust?  Any insight would be
greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200203221307.AA070390pd80000132198@gard.com>

I am trying to run a PowerDOE simulation with the "evap-cool" system type
and am having trouble controlling the system's supply fans. The fans need to
be run as constant volume, and I have specified this in the input:

   FAN-CONTROL      = CONSTANT-VOLUME

But, the run at cfm's ranging from 0 to my entered supply flow of 3900 cfm.
My baseline model is setup as a packaged heat pump and has no problems with
the constant volume fan control.

Has anyone run into a similar problem and have an idea how to properly
control the fans?

And you can download GSHP performance curve GroundLoopHP_curves.zip on the

I'd like to use a DOE-2 based BEA software to estimate the feasibility of
GSHP (ground source heat pump) applications? I looked at the eQUEST wizard,
but GSHP isn't an available HVAC system option. I thought about creating a
generic model using DOE-2.1E, however, creating "generic" GSHP systems
wouldn't be a simple task. 

Any ideas will be appreciated.

 Symposium on the coupling of building air flow
and energy modelling programs<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =
"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

Call for Abstracts

ASHRAE Technical Committees 4.7 (Energy Calculations) and TC 4.10 (Indoor
Environment Modelling) are jointly organizing a symposium on the subject of
coupling energy and air flow modelling programs.  The target date for the
symposium is the summer 2003 ASHRAE meeting.

The symposium will consider the coupling of energy analysis and: nodal or
network air flow methods for modelling infiltration, inter-zone air flow,
and pollutant dispersion; zonal or computational fluid dynamics methods for
modelling air motion, indoor air quality and comfort conditions within
rooms; intermediate methods for resolving room stratification; strategies
for integrating these diverse modelling domains; innovative applications of
coupled models; and other advances related to the coupling of energy
analysis and air flow programs.

Interested authors are invited to submit an abstract of their proposed paper
to Ian Beausoleil-Morrison at the e-mail address shown below.  The abstract
should not exceed 500 words and should provide an outline of the paper,
demonstrate the unique contribution, and should clearly indicate how the
paper will relate to the theme "coupling of energy and air flow modelling
programs ".  Abstracts should be submitted in either PDF (preferred) or Word
format and must be received by June 10.  Authors will be notified of
abstract acceptance in July, following the ASHRAE summer meeting.

Dear Farraj,

If you need to monitor the heat flux, temperatures etc. of individual walls
you may want to take a look at IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (ICE) at
www.equa.se/ice . ICE allows you to interact closely with the models and
monitor each variable. Three alternative wall models are offered: (1) a full
finite difference model where all internal temperatures are available, (2) a
corresponding model with a separate BDF integration algorithm (default), and
(3) a  two or three node RC network model, where parameters are
automatically optimized at relevant frequences.

Best regards,

Per Sahlin

Dear Farraj Alajmi,

the multizone building model Type56 of TRNSYS, where Prebid is the user
surface for the definition of the builing, does consider the thermal
capacity effects of the walls. The walls are modeled according to the
transfer function relationships of Mitalas and Arseneault defined from
surface to surface.

z-transfer functions for the calculation of transient heat transfer through

walls and roofs", Division of National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa.
