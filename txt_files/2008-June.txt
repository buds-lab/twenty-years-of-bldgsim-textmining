Can anyone share their experiences concerning the SimBuild conference?  The
next version of it is planned for Berkeley, CA this summer:

http://www.ibpsa.us/simbuild2008/

I create and run energy models in eQuest for a firm that does LEED
consulting.  I?ve already attended training put on by the Energy Center of
Wisconsin (which was superb).  I?m interested primarily in events and
resources that will improve my productivity.  Would SimBuild be useful in
this regard?

I?d love to hear your thoughts!

All-

I'm trying to configure my model to change automatically between an
overhead air distribution and a displacement vent system.  Under the
Space/Lighting properties I would like to define the "LIGHT-HEAT-TO"
to switch between my plenum if its displacement or the "unused"
command if overhead.  I have tried to use the following DOE2 input but
for some reason it keeps giving me an error.  Can anyone see any
mistakes or help out?

   LIGHT-HEAT-TO    = if (#PA("DV On/Off")=1) then
   SymIndex("EL1 Classroom 1 Pln", "SPACE", "LIGHT-HEAT-TO")
   else unused
   endif


This is the ERROR I am recieving --- >

*ERROR****************************************************************************************
*ERROR*****LIGHT-HEAT-TO in EL1 Classroom 1 has Expression Evaluation Error:
            BDL Symbol 'EL1 Classroom 1 Pln' not found

Hello Steve,
 
Yes, SimBuild is definitely useful.
 
The SimBuild2008 conference in Berkeley promises to have everything and more
than the previous two successful ones at Colorado (2004) and MIT (2006).
There are about 37 peer-reviewed technical presentations scheduled, and in
addition to U.S. and Canadian authors, there are 10 or so coming from abroad
from countries such as the UK, Brazil, China, France, and Germany.  So, we
will be hearing about a broad spectrum of simulation activities.
 
Check out registration details at: http://www.ibpsa.us/simbuild2008.
 
Best regards,
 
LOD

Message-ID: <003d01c8c67b$c9aca0f0$2f01a8c0@Studer>

Hello,

 

ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G has a clause pertaining to self-shading of the
baseline building, but there does not seem to be any explicit direction
regarding shading from other objects beyond the building envelope (trees,
buildings, etc).  Should the base case be modeled as being impacted by
adjacent buildings or other objects?  Would this be different for a new
building versus an existing building that is being gutted?

 

Thanks

Eric, 

 

My understanding is that, regardless of the fact that the building is
new or existing, there is no specific requirement regarding the modeling
of neighboring shading objects.

Appendix G does specifically state that for existing buildings being gutted,
the Baseline building envelope should be modeled based on the existing
conditions prior to any revisions that are part of the scope of work being
evaluated (Table G3.1(5)(f)).  Therefore, if you are modeling self-shading
and adjacent buildings in the proposed case for an existing building, they
should also be modeled in the base case for existing buildings.

Jason,

The greenbuilding and the big green mailing list sometimes get questions

on LEED. It would be a good idea to have a mailing list for all things

LEED, if you are thinking along those lines.

What if it's an existing building, but the project is going LEED-NC or Core
and Shell.  Does the baseline get modeled as the existing conditions of the
building before demo? If a project is going for LEED -existing buildings,
then the baseline energy model should be with existing conditions.  What
delegates whether the baseline model should be an ASHRAE perpetration or
existing conditions?

Even if it is going LEED-NC or Core & Shell, the applicable ASHRAE
Performance Rating Method (ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G Table G3.1(5)(f))
states that the baseline envelope should be modeled with existing conditions
prior to any retrofit.  The envelope for additions to the existing building
should be modeled with the applicable ASHRAE Building Envelope Requirements
table and corresponding Appendix G Table G3.1(5) requirements.

LEED for existing buildings uses benchmarking for comparison, not energy
modeling.

What if there is existing conditions and no know gives you anything and all
they keep saying to you when you ask about it repeatedly that there is 3" of
insulation?

Even if it is going LEED-NC or Core & Shell, the applicable ASHRAE
Performance Rating Method (ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G Table G3.1(5)(f))
states that the baseline envelope should be modeled with existing conditions
prior to any retrofit.  The envelope for additions to the existing building
should be modeled with the applicable ASHRAE Building Envelope Requirements
table and corresponding Appendix G Table G3.1(5) requirements.

LEED for existing buildings uses benchmarking for comparison, not energy
modeling.

Appendix G does specifically state that for existing buildings being gutted,
the Baseline building envelope should be modeled based on the existing
conditions prior to any revisions that are part of the scope of work being
evaluated (Table G3.1(5)(f)).  Therefore, if you are modeling self-shading
and adjacent buildings in the proposed case for an existing building, they
should also be modeled in the base case for existing buildings.

Hello,

 

ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G has a clause pertaining to self-shading of the
baseline building, but there does not seem to be any explicit direction
regarding shading from other objects beyond the building envelope (trees,
buildings, etc).  Should the base case be modeled as being impacted by
adjacent buildings or other objects?  Would this be different for a new
building versus an existing building that is being gutted?

 

Thanks

I'm getting a Caution in DOE2.2 when I set DESIGN-COND-T for an air
cooled chiller to a value greater than 85 F.  The default air-cooled
curve appears to be normalized to 95F, so I assume the limit should be
higher than 85. 

 

Does anyone know whether there is really a problem with this?  If not,
can I do something to suppress the error?

                    "Expectations and realities: building performance in
                    the age of consequences"

Simulation has proved invaluable in helping designers to choose between
options.  It has been less good at predicting actual outcomes,
particularly for energy use in commercial buildings.  There are many
reasons for this.  The utility meters measure all the energy used,
simulations usually don't account for all the various end uses.
Simulators expect buildings to work in accordance with design intent,
usually discrepancies arise.  Buildings are tending to get more
complicated, but complication gets in the way.  Intelligent controls
often have hidden overheads and confuse occupiers and management.

Until now this credibility gap hasn't mattered much: energy was cheap,
few people measured in-use performance, and peak oil and climate change
were somewhere over the horizon. But buildings are now in the frame and
politicians and the public expect new buildings will automatically
perform radically better than older ones.  Not necessarily!  How can we
change the process, set stretching but realistic targets, and manage
expectations through to a satisfactory completion, and learn from the
process?

Bill Bordass is currently visiting LBNL from the UK, to provide some
input to work on building energy performance reporting and benchmarking.
Initially a physical chemist, he joined the A&E firm RMJM London to work
on technical support and user requirements, and became responsible for
developing its in-house environmental engineering team.  In the 1980s he
set up his own business, doing strategy, monitoring, and
troubleshooting, including reviewing the performance of low-energy
buildings and technologies for government clients and preparing
benchmarks and technical guidance.  He was responsible for the survey
methods in the Probe series of published post-occupancy evaluations and
has has recently been working on building energy certification in the UK
and Europe.  He is also research director of the Usable Buildings Trust,
a not-for-profit organisation that promotes better building performance
through understanding what actually works, see

Thanks to all who have weighed in on the issue of site shading.  Table
G3.1(5)(f) pertains to the building envelope and not the site.  The
complication arises when considering the rotation of the base case building
to remove the impact of building orientation.  If there are adjacent
existing buildings, then a rectangular building footprint would likely
conflict with them.  It seems that this is an item that should be clarified
in 90.1-2007?

SCE (SoCal Edison) rates are the most complicated one's I've modeled.
They include time of day and seasonal rates.  I suggest inputting those
rates from the wizard (first screen) into the model and adjusting the
values from the library to match your rates and times.  This is a "work
backwards from the answer" kind of approach.  Before using this approach
and learning how to enter various types of rates, I struggled with
getting the utility rates setup in eQUEST correctly as well.

1) If the shading device is external, create it as a wall, not as a family. Yes, each one has to be individually created and can be very pain staking. When you export it you shall see it within the obstruction file.
2) If it is internal to the room, create the shading devices as normal (using walls). Then move them a certain distance external to the building. Export the file. Open up the obstruction file and relocate all the shading devices to their desired location. hey presto, internal shading devices.
3) You can try the impossible and model the shading devices within IES using ModelIt.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] regarding energy modeling

Good morning!

 

Sir, we just have a query regarding energy modeling,.. we're encountering
some problem with a residential & commercial bldg. project utilizing Ground
floor as a parking area.

The scenario usually looks like this: say it's a B+G+4 Residential Bldg., in
that. Basement (with a zero setbacks) and Ground floor is utilized as a
parking area. In the Ground floor setbacks is there and their using lattice
works (open crisscrossed pattern) for the openings instead of glazing (I
think this is for natural ventilation) the entry & exit for the vehicle is
also open (nothing on it).. how will we put this to Visual DOE? Do we need
to include this on the Energy Model? If yes,.. then how? 

 

Thanks!

Apologies for resurrecting this thread!  I've been trying to decide on
simulation software for LEED/ASHRAE 90.1 analyses.  I can't find any
evidence that DOE-2 based tools are requirement for LEED/ASHRAE 90.1
analysis but they seem to be the standard.  I'm concerned about the
likelihood of extra work justifying the use of alternative calculation
tools to third parties who may be unfamiliar with them.

Is there a list of accredited tools for LEED/ASHRAE 90.1, or a list of
software that has been assessed against ASHRAE 140? I've found this
page: (http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/info/qualified_software/),
which lists "Qualified Software for Calculating Commercial Building Tax
Deductions".  Is this relevant - eQuest is conspicuous by its absence.

Am I correct in thinking that both eQuest and Visual DOE are front ends
for DOE-2, and Design Builder is a front end for EnergyPlus.  I thought
EnergyPlus was an evolution of DOE-2, so why are tools continuing to use
the DOE-2 engine?

I appreciate the danger of relying on a graphical front end without a
good understanding of the underlying model description.  What's the
difference between DOE-2 and EnergyPlus in this respect?  How easy is it
to pick through a simulation model from the inside?  This may be quite
important if the front end doesn't provide the flexibility needed - it
may be necessary to go into the guts of the model...

Other things I'm interested include model exchange with other tools such
as Ecotect/Sketchup and CAD, possibly via gbXML import/export.

Training and support is an important consideration - how much of an edge
do commercial interfaces like VisualDOE and Design Builder have, over
software supported on a voluntary basis?  My company is based in the UK,
so local training and support are important - that counts heavily
against VisualDOE and in favour of Design Builder.  Internet mailing
lists are very useful, but there are occasions when a definitive answer
is needed right there and then.  Are there there third parties providing
paid-for support for the free packages?

A lot of questions - any answers, comments and recommendations much
appreciated.

Regards,

Nick Doylend

Subject: [Bldg-sim] fan-coil systems in e-quest
Message-ID: <10ebea3b0806090831y7103f972vc33acc07774537b6@mail.gmail.com>

First, thank you everybody for your previous responses. They helped a lot.

I have another question: in fan-coil systems, there is no supply fan except
for the ones placed in the terminal units. What's the point of requiring the
fan data in the fancoil-system properties window? Isn't it more
reasonable to fix it at zone level (air flow in zone properties
window) instead of at system level?

Thank you very much.

Message-ID: <001b01c8ca61$56c81210$04583630$@benayed@eb-engineers.com>

Dear all,

 

Appendix G states that the baseline building should be modeled so that it
does not shade itself.  

Is it possible in IES<VE> to turn on/off surface shading? Thank you for the
input.

SIM List,

                Does anyone have an opinion on whether this document
will help to allow a direct comparison between installing a geothermal
plant rather than connecting to an existing steam plant in a campus
situation (University).`

As I've read it so far this type of comparison is what the document is
intended to address, however upon closer reading the actual energy study
requirements for Step 2 (Aggregate building / DES scenario) energy model
the comparison requires a "virtual on-site hot water / chiller" for the
proposed case model rather than comparing the central plant in the
baseline model to an "as designed" model such as is the case in Step 1.

Any thoughts on this discrepancy?

If my memory serves me correctly the hours associated with night  
purge and optimal start are included in the hours loads not met.  As  
one would expect during these operational conditions, the space  
temperatures would often be out of range.  200-300 is not  
unreasonable in my experience.

Chris,
We had a look at this recently.  For a curtainwall system with panels  
captured on two sides by a non-thermally broken aluminium mullion and  
structurally glazed (butt joint) on the other two showed a  
theoretical overall vision panel of 2.1 W/m2 oK for a system with a  
COG U-Value of 1.7 (divide by 5.678 for IP) according to the  
consultant using Therm and Window 5.2.  The high values in the ASHRAE  
handbook (2.6-2.8) I believe reflect a larger frame area ...

Eric,
I believe this document as written applies only if the project utilizes district energy and so if you are not using district energy, Tables G3.1.1A & B stand.

SIM List,
                Does anyone have an opinion on whether this document will help to allow a direct comparison between installing a geothermal plant rather than connecting to an existing steam plant in a campus situation (University).`
As I've read it so far this type of comparison is what the document is intended to address, however upon closer reading the actual energy study requirements for Step 2 (Aggregate building / DES scenario) energy model the comparison requires a "virtual on-site hot water / chiller" for the proposed case model rather than comparing the central plant in the baseline model to an "as designed" model such as is the case in Step 1.
Any thoughts on this discrepancy?

Message-ID: <007001c8cb19$7dd71e10$7401a8c0@CAD03>

I'm working on a project that is pursuing an evaporatively cooled
condensing section on its DX units.  From what I can tell there isn't a
direct way to model this in eQUEST as the only options for condenser
sections are air-cooled, water cooled, and evap pre-cooled.  

 

Since this application is really just an air cooled condenser with water
being sprayed over the coils to allow an approach to the outdoor wetbulb
temperature would the best way to model it be to get a custom Cooling EIR
curve as a function of entering wetbulb and drybulb temperatures from the
manufacturer?  

 

Does anyone have experience modeling this type of system?

 

Thanks,

a lot of work).
 
In the next couple of weeks I should have the weather file downloads
available for it (and the tutorials over the next couple of months once
I get my TA for the fall semester assigned  to me). In the meantime, its
got Chapel hill weather.

Eric, for LEED, your case of a proposed geothermal design against an appendix G baseline wouldn't have to involve the district energy since the baseline only has district energy if the proposed design also does.

A comparison of geothermal to district energy would be on your own terms to decide which system to recommend as far as client economics.  For LEED, you would use the new 2-Step system for your points, which would use a different baseline than in the geothermal case.

Paul, I agree with your interpretation about earning two points in Step 1 compared to earning one or no points under step 2 when considering district energy plant efficiencies.

In effect, this document gives you the opportunity to certify your project by doing the best you can with an existing district energy plant where you might otherwise be excluded from LEED certification if you were forced to include it.  At the same time, allowing those who have more efficient district energy systems to take credit.

Eric,
I believe this document as written applies only if the project utilizes district energy and so if you are not using district energy, Tables G3.1.1A & B stand.

According to the document, feedback should go to leedinfo at usgbc.org<mailto:leedinfo at usgbc.org> and I have just submitted the following questions:
Does Table 4 direct the comparison of all district energy cooling against electric cooling?
Does Table 4 direct the comparison of all district energy heating against natural gas or oil fired heating?

Is the intent to model the district energy system with the utility rates that it actually operates under?

Are the project's saving adjusted lower if the proposed or default district energy system efficiency is lower than the baseline system efficiency?

Worded another way:
Does the project receive Step 2's point value whether it is higher or lower than Step 1 within the bounds of
1) maximum of 4 additional points by Step 2 over Step 1
2) 2 points shown in Step 1  (because if Step 1 shows 2 or more points and Step 2 shows less than 2 points, then the project would elect not to pursue more than the minimum and thus not document Step 2)

I encourage others to share their questions or feedback while the document is new.  Also, ASHRAE's 90.1 ECB committee is working on addressing the same issue which presumably will result in a publicly reviewable proposed addenda.

Hi,
I was at an Equest training seminar recently that was taught by one of the authors of the program.
He stated that they purposefully have not saught approval of Equest for the Tax Deduction program.
My understanding of the teacher's explanation was that CA funded the writing of Equest and it is really intended for use by engineers seeking to prove compliance with the CA energy code.? However, Equest has obviously evolved to be used by lots of people throughout the country.??Since the staff to support the software is very small (a few people) they have purposely avoided seeking to be listed as compliant software on the Tax website because of the expected barrage of questions and requests that they would then need to support and fund on a national level.?? I think their goal is to eventually provide more support, but, CA is naturally reluctant to pay for support for the rest of the nation.? The funding would need to come from elsewhere.
?
In terms of using Equest for the Tax Deduction, perhaps you could argue that the program is really DOE 2 with a user friendly interface and?is thus compliant.
?

Are you looking for typical year or actual year weather data for these sites? The closest locations in the new TMY3 data set are Carlsbad/Palomar for Escondido, and Concord Buchanan Field for San Ramon.

I have just packed the TMY3 weather set into DOE-2 *.bin format, and am looking into a way to put them on the Web for download. 
In the meanwhile, attached are the files for Carlsbad and Concord (sent to Jian Sun only).

Sir,
 I am doing project study that is under conceptual stage. For the project
SS.CREDIT.2 (development density and community connectivity) is not
applicable. To achieve this credit they have only one option i.e. (Option 2:
Construct / develop in previously developed site 
              AND with 0.5 mile of a neighborhood with an average density of
10 units per acre AND within 0.5 mile of at least 10 basic services AND
pedestrian access between the building & the services).
 ( Reclaimed land to consider to the previously developed.)

Are you looking for typical year or actual year weather data for these

Greetings,

I am trying to compare two different types of

However, I can not seem to find where to input any sort of performance

The only inputs I can find are: max and min humidity

Any help on the subject would be appreciated.

One thing to be careful of when considering the impact of low
temperature air distribution on energy use:  Depending on climate, many
hours of economizer cooling may be lost.  This can be a huge impact in
mild climates, and should be evaluated in all climates that have
moderate temperatures for at least a few months a year.  The increased
plant energy use from the loss of "free" cooling can dwarf the air
transport savings, unless this is accounted for in the design and
control of the air systems.

Bill makes a good point about taking advantage of the lower temperature
of the ice system. I worked on a project that had an ice storage system
that took advantage of the colder temperature. We made the chilled water
supply temperature 38F and return temperature 62F (DeltaT=24F). The
pumping power saved was pretty significant, since the chilled water had
to be pumped underground more than 1200 feet from the Chiller Plant to
the main building. The lower chilled water temperature allowed me to use
lower supply air temperature at the air handlers, which allowed me to
select smaller air handlers (due to lower cfm), which allowed me to
actually fit the air handlers into the allotted space! So there are more
benefits than just energy cost benefits...if you take advantage of the
opportunities.

I doubt that night-time wet bulb depression is sufficient in most places
to compensate for the difference between saturated evaporating
temperatures associated with typical chilled water and ice production
systems.  However, break-even seems to be attainable for air-cooled
systems.

Variable speed compressors and thermal storage are a good match because
VS operation maximized the impact of a lift reduction.

A key to saving energy with ice storage or any other low temperature
production scheme is to take advantage of the low temperature source.
The most common examples are low temperature water distribution and low
temperature air distribution to achieve larger temperature differences
and reduce transport energy consumption.

Other benefits of  thermal storage that are significant, but frequently
poorly quantified, if quantified at all, are load management
effects--more efficient part loading, preferential loading of  more
efficient equipment, etc.

Agree with everything David pointed out. While ice making chillers would
use more energy to create the colder temperatures needed for phase
change, they often do this at night when cooling tower doesn't work as
hard and ambients drop (in some climates) so net energy is often less.
In other words, the kWh consumption can be less as well as peak kW
savings under rate tarriff considerations.

For EAC1, the comparison is about energy cost.  The ice storage will
save money IF you have time-of-day electricity rates in place.  If you
are using the EIA state average rate data, it won't show a savings.

Ice storage actually uses more energy not less -- you can get more out
of the ice, but remember that you have to spend the same amount of
refrigeration energy to make the ice, plus the chiller will be working
against unfavorable temperatures and fluid properties which will use
more compressor energy compared to conventional chilled water, per
ton-hr.

Maybe there is merit if you can say what savings there are from
night-time electricity compared to day-time electricity, or if there is
some major problem with electricity distribution in your area.

Your client may be interested in first cost savings if you design a
partial storage system, but don't expect any LEED credit for that.

Dear colleagues,

I would kindly ask for an information please.
I am thinking of designing an ice storage chilling system that would
generate ice at night, during low electricity rates, and will be used
during the following day for to reduce peak cooling demands of the
building.

Could I get LEED credits in Energy and Atmosphere section for reducing
the cooling cost?

In addition, taking into account that ice can absorb more heat than that
of water and therefore will lead to much more chilling capaciity or
"tons" of refrigeration from the same size/horsepower rating of
compressors than a conventional type of chiller.
I gues I could get more LEED credits for being environmentally friendly?

Please advise.
Thanks muchly.

Regards Sasa Pantic

I have a building that passes T24 in eQUEST, but the capacities for the Central Fan Summary, and the Domestic Water Heater Summary don't match my inputs into the model.  Does anyone have any experience with fixing this, or can explain to me why this might be OK?  Here are the discrepancies:
 
Actual/Modeled/T24 Rpt Capacities [cfm]:
Supply Fan: 2 @ 33,200/66,400/38,180
Return Fan: 2 @ 29,500/39,000/44,850
 
Modeled capacities are the SUPPLY-FLOW and RETURN-FLOW, with the C-SUP-FAN-QTY  and C-RET-FAN-QTY equal to 2.  Everything is at sea-level.
 
for DHW, there are 54 instantaneous electric water heaters which have a total capacity of 1.297 MBtu/h, but the form lists it as 24,019 MBtu/h.

David,

I would set up your cooling tower with a heat exchanger and then in
your air-side system go to the "Cooling" tab.  Within that click on
the "Economizer" tab.  Turn on your water-side economizer and assign
the correct parameters to this tab (condensing loop, etc..).

If you need more specific help, please let me know.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Cost of Chilled Water from a central plant
In-Reply-To: <006301c8cb62$6ab8ab20$6701a8c0@yjhuangx26>
Message-ID: <99A2815FF4D295488E034407278B16A401EA6C21@sacexm01.nexant.corp>

Hello All:
 
A Non-eQuest question..
 
Can anyone give me a good number for the cost of generating chilled
water from a central plant (to sell to a Customer)? This CHW will be
generated by an absorption chiller which gets its input from a
cogeneration system (probably gas fired reciprocating engine).
 
I think the number I need is the "cost to generate" side. I will let the
Client decide his profit margin.
 
A friend inquired to me, and I know there is VAST experience from the
fine people on this Web Site.
 
My thanks.

Hi, all,

Does anyone have experience simulate exterior and interior light shelf?
I couldn't find this function in eQUES. Any suggestion to simulate it in
a simular way in eQUEST? Energyplus has a simple input function for
light shelf, any comment about it? 

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <FA5ADDF4A8F8294482D7D6FE6FF8777602A322A1@tme-s05.tmecorp.com>

This question does not deal directly with a simulation program, but affects a
program that is used to calculate inputs that would go into a simulation
program such as eQuest.

 

I'm trying to use the Window5 program to correctly calculate overall window
properties (u-value, SHGC, VT, etc.) for a project.

 

Within the program I can't seem to be able to create a new window that has a
different width and height than the preprogrammed default ? 47.244" W by
59.055" H

 

The width and height are always grayed out and therefore unable to be
changed.

 

Does anybody know how to input different width and height values than the
default values?

 

Thanks a bunch for your help with this! J

James -

 

On the Window Library Detailed View screen in WINDOW 5, the Type field
controls the height and width of the window. There are several choices in
the pulldown list, which you can use if these fit your window - you will see
the dimensions change as you pick the different types. The last 3 options in
that Type pulldown list are "Custom" options - Custom Dual Vision
Horizontal, Custom Dual Vision Vertical, and Custom Single Vision. Selecting
one of these three choices will allow you to then input values in the Width
and Height input fields.

Hi;

I installed the Energy Plus V2.1.0.023  package and V2.2.023 package on 
a new machine recently
Started the IDF Editor, everything OK.
Then I tried to open one of the E+ manuals via the Help tab and got

"Error initiating acrobat to view documentation file"

never seen anything like it.  Only happens with the E+ 2.1.023 not the 
2.2.023.
Suggestions ??
Acrobat has been having problems recently with
machines that had very old versions of  Acrobat updated over the years. The
most recent update creates major problems unless all the Adobe s/w is 
removed
and a fresh start is made.  But this is a new machine.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Exterior Light pollution analysis
Message-ID: <4850ebdb.1f068e0a.5d6f.637b@mx.google.com>

 

Dear All,

 

This is regarding night sky light pollution and is being asked here in
context of LEED SS Cr 8 (Light pollution reduction).

 

Project is lighting two of the facades with metal halide lamps. The tilt
angle of the Lamps is such that almost all of the lumens emitted will strike
through the faced surface and thus, in effect, will not cause any night sky
light pollution.

 

As per LEED reference guide, the maximum tilt able angle should be
considered while deciding the number of lumens sent above the horizontal
plane i.e. 90 degree from nadir. Will there be any concession in this
project where, of course, lamps are throwing lumens up side but most of them
being reflected back to ground by fa?ade and hence, are not causing any
night sky light pollution.

 

Any input will be appreciated.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Prabhat Barnwal

I'm working on an energy model for a 4 story lab building that has 4
stories of parking beneath it.  
 
Am I correct that for the ASHRAE baseline building, I would select the
system that falls in the "4 or 5 floors or less than 75,000 sq ft" for
the office portion of the building, and then just set up a common
ventilation system for the 4 levels of garage to mimic garage
supply/exhaust unregulated energy?  The garage levels don't turn my
building into an 8-story building do they?
 
Thanks in advance!

Greetings and sorry for the cross-posting. 

 

I am developing an informal survey of simulation programs used across
the US in courses involved in HVAC education in architecture and
engineering programs. 

 

If you are an educator and teach a course that uses a simulation program
of any sort or duration please drop me an email if you are in interested
in participating. I will respond with a short (I promise...) form to
fill-in that will then be assembled across responses and presented at
the upcoming SIMBUILD 2008 Conference in Berkeley, July 30 - August 1st,
2008.

Message-ID: <bca41f5e0806131905h741069c4jb8ab5610be1742b2@mail.gmail.com>

I have a LEED simulation project per ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G.

The project needs more than 32,000 RT.

Per ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G each chiller shall be set as 800 RT or smaller.

That means I should create more than 40 chillers.

But I can not create more than 30 chillers in eQUEST v.3.61.

Is there a limit number of chiller sets?

Would you please give me suggestions to solve the problem for complying with
LEED EAc1?
 Thank you.

Message-ID: <bca41f5e0806131935t6fc129f6gd113f76dc67dd111@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I have a project for factory energy simulation, where there is a lot of
process cooling water load.

It is a process cooling water load not a cooling load dissipated to the air
side by convection so it shall not be assigned to the receptacle
equipment of space.

When I tried to assign a process load on a chilled water loop, the report
showed it not only increased the energy use of HVAC system but also
increased the energy use of receptacle equipment.

Theoretically, process cooling water load shall only be carried out by the
chilled water system.

I don't know why it cause the energy use increase of receptacle equipment.

Would you please tell me how to solve the problem?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] District Thermal Energy
Message-ID: <66f63cae0806150959i1118e9dfgc3a606a154b54642@mail.gmail.com>

Dear folks,

I am simulating a project to be LEED-certified (LEED-NB).
There is a central chiller plant using thermal storage that provides thermal
energy to 6 buildings.

In the document "Required Treatment of District Thermal Energy in LEED-NC
version 2.2 and LEED for Schools" Table 1 as below:

Complete 2 energy models using the following methods:
? Step 1: Building stand-alone scenario document performance of project
building alone, with upstream equipment modeled as cost neutral

? Step 2: Aggregate building / DES scenario document combined performance of
the building and central plant by including the performance of upstream
equipment

Please advise what is the proper setting for such a district thermal
energy system in Equest,.

During each step,which way is more appropriate to simulat 6 buildings whitin
one Equest model or separately simulate each building?

Jessi

Message-ID: <9875E9A2A64E2A46950A17A14483B86701406B23@brandon.cdiengineers.com>

Hello,

 

I am currently getting a BDL error in my EQUEST model that says:

 

SPACE EL1 East Perim Spc (G.E1) has no ZONE - one is required

 

I cannot figure how to assign a ZONE to a SPACE to fix this error.  I
would greatly appreciate it if somebody would please help me out with
this.  The error happened when I was changing some input in the service
hot water loop.  I hit a bug somewhere that caused an error loop.  Once
these error windows came up, I could not get back to the model no matter
which options I chose in the error windows.  So, I ended up
disconnecting power to my computer and rebooting.  When I opened the
model back up, I got this BDL error, and I have not been able to figure
out what is wrong or how to fix it.

 

Thank you in advance for any help you might be able to provide.

Simply create a new thermal zone in the air-side tab under the 
appropriate system. Then you will be asked to assign a space to that 
zone and be given a list of unassigned spaces.

Hello,

 

I'm sure this has been addressed at some point, but does anyone have
experience or tutorials in setting up ground source heat pump loops in
eQuest?  I have been able to set up the ground source heat exchanger,
but I'm unsure of the methods and limitations for linking the ground
source loop to the water/water or water/air heat pump component.  Are
both situations possible?  For an airside device, would I set up the
ground loop, then set up the airside device and select the particular
water source loop with which to link it?

 

Thanks in advance for any advice.

 

Todd

Hello All,

 

Is transfer air possible in eQuest?  I haven't been able to find it
there, but I found this command for DOE-2:

 

C-TRNSFR-AIR-CFM, 

which refers to "The amount of outside ventilation air transferred into
(positive value) from another zone or out of a zone (negative value) to
another zone. Transfer air is calculated according to the exception to
Section 121(b)2 of the standards.The default is zero (no transfer air),"
according to the DOE-2 help.  I haven't found it used, however, to get
the correct syntax and links to other zones.  Has anyone encountered
this?

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] A question about ASHRAE baseline loop pump power
Message-ID: <1213683059.48575573ac9e6@webmail.vt.edu>


Hi all ?
I?m working on an ASHRAE baseline model with system #7 in eQuest. ASHRAE
requires the chilled water loop pump power of 19W/gpm. So I ran the model with
the default head and pump kW (left then blank) first, and found the gpm of the
pump from the report, then I calculated and input the kW of the pump. However,
after I ran the model again with this pump power, the pump gpm result was
changed in the report. Also, I got a warning that said the pump flow input is
lower than the actual flow. There is no input for a pump flow. So I don?t know
what happened inside eQuest.

Do you know what is wrong here? How to model the ASHRAE loop pump power
correctly in eQuest?

Thanks a lot!

I deal with this by adjusting the "pipe-head" of the loop until the
total specific design pump power = 19 W/gpm, while still letting
eQuest/DOE2 "autosize" the pumps.
 
I believe this W/gpm should be calculated as  (sum of all pump power
for both "primary" and "secondary" pumps connected to a loop)/design
loop flow. In addition to the loop (secondary) pump, the ASHRAE baseline
includes primary pumps, in DOE-speak, a "CHW-PUMP" and "CW-PUMP" for
each chiller, which is not the way eQuest sets things up by default. And
only the "primary" pump on the CW loop.

SimBuild 2008
http://www.ibpsa.us/simbuild2008/ <http://www.ibpsa.us/simbuild2008/> 

IBPSA-USA will hold its third national conference from July 30 to August 1,
2008 on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley. The format
will be similar to the two previous SimBuild conferences held at the
University of Colorado at Boulder in 2004 and at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 2006.

The meeting is open to all, world-wide. Being near San Francisco, Berkeley
is a convenient destination for travelers from major cities in the U.S. and
in many other countries.  U.C. Berkeley is the oldest campus of the
University of California system, which also operates the well-known
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Lawrence Hall of Science, the
Space Sciences Laboratory, and the U.C. Botanical Garden. The city of
Berkeley contains a variety of neighborhoods with diverse character and
excellent restaurants.  The "Bay Area" is full of visitor attractions
accessible within 20 minutes, such as the city of San Francisco, scenic
mountains, and rich architecture (including the Frank Lloyd Wright Civic
Center).  Numerous wineries are within one hour travel to the Napa and
Sonoma valleys, where wine-tasting tours are available.

We look forward to welcoming you to Berkeley!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Allocation of Equipment Energy
Message-ID: <417882.20348.qm@web58106.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Hello,
   
  I am new to eQUEST and now is modeling a office building. Afer I ran the simulation for the building peformance analysis. I got the error messages for each thermal zone in the detailed output files.
   
  **WARNING**********************************************************************
               Zone: EL1 West Perim Zn (G.W1)         could not successfully
               allocate all equipment energy to the 5-minute bins
               because of an equipment overload.  The peak load
               used in ECONOMICS will not include the fraction due
               to the overload, but the PLANT reports will.
               Mon/Day/Hour:  1  2  8  Energy:  22.9  Unallocated: 2.921
   
  In my model, actually I didn't define the equipment load. Only internal load is the lighting load.  Does anyone have any ideas how to fix the problem?
   
  Thanks a lot
   
  Shaojie

Hello,

 

It would be greatly appreciated if someone would provide some advice on
how to create a user input expression.  In order to easily manipulate
the percent glass of a building in the detailed interface, I would like
to create an expression that sets window width based on a global
parameter for percent glass I created.  To accomplish this, I right
click on the width input cell and select "Edit/View User Expression...",
then enter the following code I came up with based on what I have been
reading in the DOE-2 help files.

 

(PARENT( EXTERIOR-WALL:HEIGHT ) *

 PARENT( EXTERIOR-WALL:WIDTH ) *

 PARAMETER("East Wall Percent Glass")) /

LOCAL( HEIGHT )

 

This does not work.  Below are the errors that the above expression
generate.

 

 

Expression Parsing Error: Invalid BDL Keyword Function Argument
'EXTERIOR-WALL:HEIGHT'

Expression Parsing Error: Invalid BDL Keyword Function Argument
'EXTERIOR-WALL:HEIGHT'

Expression Parsing Error: Invalid BDL Keyword Function Argument
'EXTERIOR-WALL:HEIGHT'

 

I have tried several variations of this expression with no luck.  

 

Thank you in advance for any advice you can provide.

 

Jeremy

To access a parent parameter use the command #P.  To access a local
parameter use the command #L.  Also, global parameters are referenced by
the #PA command.  The errors you describe are because the name of the
parameter you are trying to reference isn't EXTERIOR-WALL:HEIGHT, it's
just HEIGHT.

 

Try this:

 

{#P("HEIGHT")*#P("WIDTH")*#PA("East Wall Percent Glass")/#L("HEIGHT")}

 

If that doesn't work let me know, as I just typed that up on the fly.

Thanks! This works well. For setting up the pumps for water side systems that
serves more than 150,000 sf, my understanding is:
1. a loop (secondary) pump with VSD and a one speed(primary) pump for each
chiller;
2. a one speed conderser water loop pump, and one pump for each chiller, which
is the same pump in (1)
3. one VSD pump for each boiler, and no loop (secondary) pump

Is that correct?

Thanks in advance!

Jeremy--

check out Brandon Nichols's page below.  Half way down that post he
describes how to do write expressions for glazing.  You can add a
glazing % global parameter to his code and it should work.

Message-ID: <FA5ADDF4A8F8294482D7D6FE6FF8777602A7F643@tme-s05.tmecorp.com>

In window 5 I want to create a laminated glazing system with the following
layers:

1.       Glass

2.       Air Space

3.       Glass

4.       PVB Interlayer

5.       Glass

 

When I select 3 glass layers, the program defaults to air layers for #2 and
#4 above.  Is there a way to change this to a clear PVB Interlayer, and does
this type of layer exist in a database?

 

Thanks,

Jay,

 

You can not create laminates in WINDOW5.  Laminates are created in OPTICS5
(another tool that can be downloaded from windows.lbl.gov/software) and then
they need to be imported in WINDOW5 as equivalent monolithic layers, but
with correct properties as laminate.  In WINDOW program you can not have two
layers touching each other.  They have to be separated by a gas gap.  This
process of creating laminates or applied films in OPTICS and import into
WINDOW is not quite straightforward, so you may want to consider training
session.  We are one of the companies that offer this service.

Jay,

PVB layers exist in the optic5 database and you have to create the
laminate like Charlie said and import into windows5.

 

There is good documentation from optics 5 and windows 5 about importing,
but the fine details will probably give you a headache. The
documentation to import a layer into optics is available here:
http://windows.lbl.gov/materials/optics5/documentation/import_a_layer_in
_optics.htm

Documenation for importing from optics to windows is here:
http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/FAQ/GlassLibUpdate.html

 

 I contacted Viracon for a a couple glazing files that are not in the
windows 5 database and the two people I spoke with were both very
helpful and sent me instructions for importing from optics to windows.
With their info, the documentation, and a little patience, it finally
worked out.

 

I sent you the two pdfs they sent me.

Thank you!  It works great now.

I have another question if you have minute to reply.  Can I reference a
parameter that is not a global, parent, or local parameter in my
expression?  For example, can I include the height of the plenum wall in
the wall area calculation?

Something like:

((PARENT( "HEIGHT" )+( EL1 East Wall (G.7.E13)("HEIGHT"))) *
PARENT( "WIDTH" ) *
PARAMETER("East Wall Percent Glass")) /
LOCAL( "HEIGHT" )

There can only be one parent so there is no need to include 
EXTERIOR-WALL in the PARENT() argument. You also need quotes around all 
arguments. Try this:
(PARENT( "HEIGHT" ) *
PARENT( "WIDTH" ) *
PARAMETER("East Wall Percent Glass")) /
LOCAL( "HEIGHT" )

Greetings!

Thank you to all who have described ways to convert the TMY3/TMY2 files to
.bin files for use in eQuest.  I was just giving it a go, and keep getting
the error below.  I shortened the station number from 6 to 5 digits by
dropping the last one as recommended.  I followed the directions provided by
Scott Horowitz, the station number in my input file matches the one in the
WEATHR file.  When I run the DOEWTH.EXE, this error message is displayed in
the output file:  

                        DOE-2.2NT35 WEATHER UTILITY PROGRAM
                                INPUT VERIFICATION

          STATION NUMBER           72507
--- ERROR --- INCORRECT STATION NUMBER




All of the errors go away in the output file if there are three spaces in
the WEATHR file after the 5-number station name, but the NEWTH.TMP file
remains empty.  Any suggestions?

There is also more documentation about making a laminate in Optics5 and
importing it into WINDOW that I think is quite complete (if not, let me
know). I put this together for a training session I did on this topic.

 

It can be found on the WINDOW 5 Knowledge Base under the section NFRC,
Laminated Glass - NFRC Procedures

 

http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/52/W52_faq.html

 

which leads you to a page 

 

http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/52/NFRCLaminates.html

 

with another link called Laminate Procedures, which is the following PDF
file:

 

http://windows.lbl.gov/software/NFRC/Training/LaminateProcedure-Final.pdf

 

This PDF has detailed step by step instructions about making laminates and
bringing the laminate into WINDOW - it's really not that hard once you have
done it one time.

Jay,

PVB layers exist in the optic5 database and you have to create the laminate
like Charlie said and import into windows5.

 

There is good documentation from optics 5 and windows 5 about importing, but
the fine details will probably give you a headache. The documentation to
import a layer into optics is available here:
http://windows.lbl.gov/materials/optics5/documentation/import_a_layer_in_opt
ics.htm

Documenation for importing from optics to windows is here:
http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/FAQ/GlassLibUpdate.html

 

 I contacted Viracon for a a couple glazing files that are not in the
windows 5 database and the two people I spoke with were both very helpful
and sent me instructions for importing from optics to windows.  With their
info, the documentation, and a little patience, it finally worked out.

 

I sent you the two pdfs they sent me.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Window 5 - Creating a laminated glazing system

 

In window 5 I want to create a laminated glazing system with the following
layers:

1.      Glass

2.      Air Space

3.      Glass

4.      PVB Interlayer

5.      Glass

 

When I select 3 glass layers, the program defaults to air layers for #2 and
#4 above.  Is there a way to change this to a clear PVB Interlayer, and does
this type of layer exist in a database?

 

Thanks,

Message-ID: <4e3d52120806181936k3fcf5ffby162c3ed92d756c5c@mail.gmail.com>

I'm looking at two south-facing multifamily residential buildings in
eQuest that are identical except for the wall construction.  The base
case walls are uninsulated 18" brick, while the proposed case walls
have an R-11 resistance layer of insulation in addition to the brick.
Windows are double low-e with around a 40% window-wall ratio.  The
building is located in Boston.

Cooling energy is higher for the proposed case (insulated walls), and
while investigating I found a strange result in the hourly reports.
The glass transmitted solar load in the insulated case consistently
peaks higher (and troughs lower) than in the uninsulated case.  I had
expected the solar loads to be the same in both cases (the solar gains
are indeed the same) since window properties are the same.

How come adding a resistance layer to the walls causes solar loads in
the space to change?
Okay, I just checked the number of response factors for the walls in
both cases.  The uninsulated case has 30, and the insulated case has
38.  I guess that's the difference, but I still don't feel like I have
a good understanding of it.  Thanks for any insights or explanations.

Ramana,
 
BEES and Athena are the two programs that seem to be talked about most frequently on our projects.  There are a lot of positives to both, but overall there is a shortcoming in the availability of extensive product data/selection.  Until there is more work done to make the product libraries more robust, most firms must rely on their own internal research and databases.  Perhaps someone might solicit and organize the information that many firms have gathered to date, but even that information is more "green/LEED" related as opposed to true LCA.  Any Master's or PhD candidates out there???
 
Paul

Hey Ramana,
I used BEES for my Master's Thesis.  It does have limitations, mostly its small material library, but it does utilize an accepted LCA database (SimaPro).  It's also a free download, which is nice.

Ramana,
 
I just had a student complete her Master's thesis on LCA/Carbon Footprinting for several campus buildings that we had data for. She used the Eco Assembly Calculator, it is a free download from Athena. I was very impressed with that tool but the material database is limited, however that should improve over time. I will send your her thesis.

Hi Ramana,
 
For single-family houses at least, a building's carbon footprint is
primarily a function of it's operational energy use (unless it is a VERY
low-energy building). The carbon footprint of building material
(cradle-to-gate plus transportation) is miniscule compared to energy for
HVAC, lights, etc. Other building types are probably similar. Regardless
of which tool or database you use, you need an energy simulation (or
utility bills) and a tool or database with good data on the carbon
footprint of delivered electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, etc. I use
SimaPro, but it's expensive and requires significant time to learn and
build models.
 
You can see a comparison between environmental footprint of building
materials and building energy use in "Comparison of the Life Cycle
Assessments of an Insulating Concrete Form House and a Wood Frame House"
(you can search the website cement.org/bookstore/ for this
publication--it's free!). 

Good luck!

Hello,
?
As a part of my MSc research I used Athena.
http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=264/pagename=alpha_list
Very user friendly, easy-to-use.
I have no experience in using BEES.

Ramana,
?
BEES and Athena are the two programs that seem to be talked about most frequently on our projects.? There are a lot of positives to both, but overall there is a shortcoming in the availability of extensive product data/selection.? Until there is more work done to make the product libraries more robust, most firms must rely on their own internal research and databases.? Perhaps someone might solicit and organize the information that many firms have gathered to date, but even that information is more "green/LEED" related as opposed to true LCA.? Any Master's or PhD candidates out there???

Message-ID: <fcbe69d00806191102qd653c65t63744ab8c8f86614@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I would like to know if anyone could explain or experience a same problem. I
use Energypro software and I try to make LEED submittal. In standard
building which is automatically generated in Energypro, I found out if I
extract BEPU report only, the percent of hours any system zone or any plant
load not satisfied shows "0.0". However If I extract BEPU report together
with SS-F report, the BEPU usually shows different number which in one of my
project it shows 51.2% which is very significant.

Is there anyone could explain me what happened with the software since the
standard building is automatically generated in Energypro and I could not
change any input. Is there anyway to fix the problem?


Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Daylight saving simulation in eQUEST
Message-ID: <s85b7630.086@urbanengineers.com>

Hi, all,

I simulated an office building with 49% window on each orientation, and
compared the results with daylighting and without daylight. The lighting
energy consumption is 48.5% less with daylighting, and the total energy
consumption is 18.5% less. I set the only sensor in each exterior zone
around 15ft from the exterior window and used default values for other
setup. I wonder if anybody with experience of daylighting think these
big(?) saving numbers are realistic?

Any input will be appreciated.

It depends on what your original schedule is for lighting - if it is full on
in the exterior zones for working hours (say 8 to 5), then daylighting will
pretty much reduce all of this to a very minimum value. You can do a rough
estimate of savings by figuring out how much of the lighting load is due to
external zones during the daylight hours.

The numbers seem reasonable but there are a few ways you can check:

1. If you're using DOE-2/ Equest, check the depth of your zone & 
photosensor location against head height of window. Rule of thumb is 
daylit depth is ~1.5 times head height of window so typical zone depth 
for 9-ft ceiling is about 15 ft with sensor at 2/3rds or 10 ft distance 
from window.  DOE-2 has limitations in calc with split-flux method: 
internally reflected component is overestimated for distances greater 
than approx 2 times head height of window which can lead to 
overestimation of lighting energy use savings.   Also, pay attention to 
interior shading schedule/ modeling assumptions.  If you have a bare 
window, you're going to get great savings but uncomfortable occupants.

2. Check results against some other software packages:
DAYSIM or Daylight123 via Christoph Reinhardt, which uses Radiance as 
core engine but friendly user interface
Run your facade design through http://commglazing.datrona.com/facade.php 
in about 5 minutes (database based on DOE-2)
Run SPOT tool  (Radiance with GUI)
Compare switching strategies vs dimming strategies (ballast energy 
consumption differs between strategies), include occupancy-sensors in 
model for base & test cases
 
3. Field data:
New York Times Headquarters monitored data for open plan office with 
actively managed shades:
http://gaia.lbl.gov/btech/papers/56979.pdf
30-48% avg annual lighitng energy savings for west facing windows and
75% for bilaterally daylit SW facing windows
with dimming, setpoint tuning, nighttime occupancy (no occ sensors 
during daytime since open plan).
Owner informally reports an operating avg LPD of 0.35 W/ft2 for May/June 
08 with installed LPD of 1.0 W/ft2. 
http://windows.lbl.gov/comm_perf/newyorktimes.htm

HMG, NREL, Weidt Group reports savings that are significantly less than 
predicted savings depending on attention paid to proper execution 
(reports published on 0-10V systems) & in particular for sidelighting 
applications.  DALI-enabled digital lighting controls (used at NYT) is 
making it easier to achieve more reliable results but still not a slam 
dunk yet.

Hope this helps,
el.

Lan,

49% is large, but not unreasonable depending on a number of factors:

1. Percentage of Core v/s skin zones 
2. Light level settings. Set the lights to dim at appropriate footcandle
levels (eQUEST defaults to 50fc)
3. Zone depth - If your zone is deeper than 20 feet, I would recommend
setting 2 lighting control sensors at different depths in the zone
controlling 50% (Or appropriate percentages). This is more realistic to
the controls that your actual building will (or should) have. 
4. Glare Indices - I'm not sure how well this factor works in eQUEST,
but the default is set to 100. However if you go into the item help, it
suggests max glare of 22 for offices. If your window shades are set to
movable (either interior or exterior) this triggers the shades. This
would probably be more realistic - especially on east & west facades.

Hope this helps.

All;
I think 20-25 gallons/day per bed seems generous for a new cardiac facility (supposedly incorporating E-Star fixtures) without a laundry and with a kitchen. But the plumbing designer is sure this is low.  
 
Does anyone have a clear simple reference for average long term domestic hot water consumption (preferably measured/metered) in hospitals?
ASHRAE Applications lists 18 gpd/bed for "nursing homes," including their kitchens, but without "heavy laundry" and with the caveat that "data predate modern low-flow fixtures." 
A Massachusetts study of total domestic (so both hot and cold) water consumption in hospitals in the early 90's found 40 - 340 gpd/bed, which could even include lawn care.  
The 90.1-2004  Users Manual (pg G-32) includes some inputs for long-term DHW energy use for "Health/Institutional" (1100 Btuh/occupant x hourly schedule fractions) that imply about 15 gallons/day per "occupant" if that energy is for actually heating the water and does not include pipe losses. But the default occupancy density listed there is about 5x the bed density in this  proposed hospital, so using it would lead to 65 gpd/bed. 
The Green Guide for Health Care has about 60 separate occupancy categories with varying DHW rates, occupant densities and schedules; all the DHW rates are also in Btuh/person and vary from 0-1000 Btuh/person, typically 600 Btuh. These are supposedly taken from "90.1-2001 ECB Supplement Tables 7.1A & 7.1B" which are not in the body of 90.1-2001.
And I'm trying to separate energy use due to consumption and energy use due to pipe heat losses. I think I searched Transactions recently and did not find anything new regarding healthcare DHW. At this point I don't care about peak hours, or instant demand, just long term average.
 
Thanks if you can help;

Hello, all,

I am simulating a 3-floor, 78000 ft2 office building with eQUEST for LEED CS. For the ASHRAE basecase (VAV system), there are many zones with the unmet heating setpoint. The unmet hours around 100-180 which are 50 hours more than than the proposed design case (water-loop heat pump system). Is there any method that can reduce the unmet hours in the basecase VAV system? I tried to increase the sizing ratio for heating and etc., but this does not reduce the unmet heated hours.

Any suggestions?

Thanks.

Try increasing thermostat deadband and insuring they are reverse acting.
You can try 4 DegF or 6 DegF.  The DOE-2 manual suggests this for VAV.

Message-ID: <967720.63015.qm@web44812.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

Hello everyone,

I am trying to model Earth-Air tunnels in eQUEST located in atropical,composite climate (New Delhi). Following the last two threadson this issue dated Nov. 2003 and Oct, 2006 (shown below) nothing elseseems to have been discussed, especially relating to modeling thisstrategy in eQUEST? If anyone has had any experience with it thenplease share. I'd appreciate your feedback. Meanwhile, let me try andexplain the system that I am trying to model and how I am approachingit --

Earth-air (horizontal) tunnels utilize 100% outside air as it is blownthrough them. This brings down the temperature as the air is sensiblypre-cooled for the air handling unit. In the hot-dry months the air iseither delivered or is subjected to direct-indirect evap-cooling. Forwarm-humid periods a small portion of the pre-cooled air stream issubjected to DX coil where it drops most of its moisture and is mixedwith the rest of the air stream In principle my strategy will be tomodel ground-source heat exchanger (GSHX) wherein a fluid (water)rejects or gains heat and transfers the benefit to the air handlingunit using 100% OA. I am guessing that the transfer of heat betweenwater-earth via the GSHX and then water-air in the AHU has to be veryefficient to diminish losses incurred and model this system fairlyaccurately. I will finally subtract the pumping energy from the total.Here is the crux, and the questions --
  
   Am I thinking in the right direction?  
   How does one increase the efficiency ofthe GSHX process to best reflect earth-air heat exchange? The aim as Isaid earlier is to diminish the losses incurred due to the water-earthand water-air processes of the GSHX?
    
For now, I am tied to eQUEST to solve thisproblem because a large time-consuming part of the model is alreadyaccomplished. However if there is a better way to address this with anyother tool then please do not shy from sharing your knowledge. Manythanks for helping in the past and in advance on this one.

sincerely,
Neeraj

A very discrete finite-... 3D conduction model would
 be desirable, but depending on your specific needs, ESP-r would be a very good candidate as an annual assessment tool. I've used ESP-r for underground air culvert assessment in the past and a couple of graduate students have used ESP-r for similar studies (Y. Jeong, a grad student at Concordia, and another student in Norway (a PhD student I believe) have both used ESP-r for assessing the Media School in Norway, which has anunderground air culvert). In Jeong's case, the culvert is modeled as one zone, but it is fairly straightfoward in ESP-r to subdivide this in, let's say, 10 zones(e.g., a 40m culvert could be made up of ten 4m segments) - that's what I do. This will give you a more detailed assessment, e.g., of culvert surfacetemperatures along the airflow path (useful for condensation assessmentor to see just how effective the first segments of the culvert are in relation to the last ones). ESP-r also allows you to set up an airflow network, but 'scheduled' airflows
 might be OK for your needs. The main challenge is setting up the surface boundary conditions. Without setting up a 3D conduction model in ESP-r (available, but not for the faint-hearted), you'll have to specify boundary conditions for each surface. If the culvert is deep enough,you can just feed it monthly ground profiles for ~&frac34; of the surfaces, with harmonics calculated with standard models (see Maitos and Argiriou) - the same models used for ground-coupled heat pump simulation. If it's deep enough, the daily variations will be minor (~ &plusmn;1&deg;C during the course of a month). The remaining ~&frac14; of the surfaces will more likely feel the effect of the nearby ground surface, so ambient air might be more suitable as a surface boundary condition. If the culvert is very close to the ground surface, then it's a bit more tricky - maybe ~&frac12; of the surfaces need ambient air as a boundary condition. You can ofcourse 'tweak' the model to see just how sensible
 it is to variable changes. Another point is setting up the right surface element 'constructions'so on one hand it remains numerically stable, and on the other the constructions remain 'thick' enough so that using monthly profiles remains valid (at least conceptually). Transsolar have modeled culverts for other energy consultants in the past - maybe they've set up some basic modeling approach in TRNSYS (?).Simpler empirical approaches are available: Argiriou and Maitos give anoverview of existing models found in the literature.

Fred,
 
The data that you're seeking would be very useful, but I'm afraid that you
are unlikely to find them.  ASHRAE Technical Committee 6.6 - Service Water
Systems is has been trying for several years to get ASHRAE approval to
sponsor a research project to gather these sorts of data.  The draft work
statement's current title is "Establishing Benchmark Levels of Commercial
and Institutional Hot Water Use by End Use".  
 
Accurate and current end-use data are required for accurate energy
simulation and for comparison of systems.  For example, comparing energy
consumption of tankless versus tank-type water heaters depends largely on
the draw patterns for a given total quantity of heated water.  Also, the
pipe losses that you mention are highly dependent upon draw pattern.
 
Since the members of TC 6.6 are unaware of current data for domestic hot
water consumption in commercial and institutional buildings, it seems likely
that these data won't exist until we can get that research project accepted
and completed.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Health Care DHW Usage


All;
I think 20-25 gallons/day per bed seems generous for a new cardiac facility
(supposedly incorporating E-Star fixtures) without a laundry and with a
kitchen. But the plumbing designer is sure this is low.  
 
Does anyone have a clear simple reference for average long term domestic hot
water consumption (preferably measured/metered) in hospitals?

*	ASHRAE Applications lists 18 gpd/bed for "nursing homes," including
their kitchens, but without "heavy laundry" and with the caveat that "data
predate modern low-flow fixtures."  

*	A Massachusetts study of total domestic (so both hot and cold) water
consumption in hospitals in the early 90's found 40 - 340 gpd/bed, which
could even include lawn care.  

*	The 90.1-2004  Users Manual (pg G-32) includes some inputs for
long-term DHW energy use for "Health/Institutional" (1100 Btuh/occupant x
hourly schedule fractions) that imply about 15 gallons/day per "occupant" if
that energy is for actually heating the water and does not include pipe
losses. But the default occupancy density listed there is about 5x the bed
density in this  proposed hospital, so using it would lead to 65 gpd/bed.  

*	The Green Guide for Health Care has about 60 separate occupancy
categories with varying DHW rates, occupant densities and schedules; all the
DHW rates are also in Btuh/person and vary from 0-1000 Btuh/person,
typically 600 Btuh. These are supposedly taken from "90.1-2001 ECB
Supplement Tables 7.1A & 7.1B" which are not in the body of 90.1-2001.

And I'm trying to separate energy use due to consumption and energy use due
to pipe heat losses. I think I searched Transactions recently and did not
find anything new regarding healthcare DHW. At this point I don't care about
peak hours, or instant demand, just long term average.
 
Thanks if you can help;

http://www.ibpsa.us/simbuild2008/ <https://owa1.nrel.gov/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://www.ibpsa.us/simbuild2008/> 

IBPSA-USA will hold its third national conference from July 30 to August 1,
2008 on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley. The format
will be similar to the two previous SimBuild conferences held at the
University of Colorado at Boulder in 2004 and at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 2006.

The meeting is open to all, world-wide. Being near San Francisco, Berkeley
is a convenient destination for travelers from major cities in the U.S. and
in many other countries.  U.C. Berkeley is the oldest campus of the
University of California system, which also operates the well-known
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Lawrence Hall of Science, the
Space Sciences Laboratory, and the U.C. Botanical Garden. The city of
Berkeley contains a variety of neighborhoods with diverse character and
excellent restaurants.  The "Bay Area" is full of visitor attractions
accessible within 20 minutes, such as the city of San Francisco, scenic
mountains, and rich architecture (including the Frank Lloyd Wright Civic
Center).  Numerous wineries are within one hour travel to the Napa and
Sonoma valleys, where wine-tasting tours are available.

We look forward to welcoming you to Berkeley!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] simulation PhD
Message-ID: <5f85bc910806222330r24731579hfa4db1a042fb4cc1@mail.gmail.com>

Dear engineers
I graduated from Czech Technical University in Prague, faculty of Mechanical
Engineering in January. My MSc studies were mostly focused on HVAC
and building simulation. I would like to continue my studies as a PhD
student. I am looking for some positions dealing with CFD, weather
conditions and building behaviour or something related to this. But I am
open also for other problems. It is always a challenge.
Do you know some possibilities for me, please? I would like to ask you for
some help. I appreciate every comment.

I am sorry if you consider this email as a spam.
Thank you very much!

Best regards

Jan Potac

Neeraj, 

I recently modeled a ground-to-air heat exchanger using GAEA. You can
download a free trial version at WWW:  http://nesa1.uni-siegen.de/ . You
can import back the results into eQuest.

Neeraj, 

I recently modeled a ground-to-air heat exchanger using GAEA. You can
download a free trial version at WWW:  http://nesa1.uni-siegen.de/ . You
can import back the results into eQuest.

We've done some modeling of the VRF in EnergyPro.

The results are quite favorable, compared to traditional split systems.

Our understanding, as of last week, is that the module for modeling VRF
that is included in Trace is not endorsed by either of the major manufacturers.
(Mitsubishi & Daikin) So, from their perspective, Energy Pro is currently 
the ONLY way to model VRF.

We've had some internal debate as to what the corresponding 90.1 baseline
system should be. I'd live to hear people's thoughts.

Regarding the baseline system. If you are using Chapter 11 ECB, the
budget system would be System 8, Packaged Terminal Heat Pump if it is a
residential application and System 9, Packaged Rooftop Heat Pump if
non-residential. If you are using Appendix G, then the baseline system
depends on the building program per Table G.3.1.1A

Travis,
Good to hear the system is showing savings.  We have a couple projects
coming up that are using or proposing VRF systems and it will be
interesting to see how the system operates in various climates.  I
imagine the VRF will perform better in certain climates.

With regards to endorsement from manufacturers, I know Martyn Dodd at
Energy Pro worked with Mitsubishi directly to develop the VRF module.

I agree with Mike on the baseline system choices.

Sam

Some independent M&V case studies would be very useful.  Also I'd like to see some of the validation work on the component model.

It will be important to have some information to verify the model results, regardless if the simulation was through a new module for an existing program or through a work-around.

  Hi,
   
  I try to model the RTU with DX coil by using Pkgd Var Vol Var Temp as system type. However, in eQUEST, I have to choose Powered Induction Unit instead of Pkgd Var Vol Var Temp if I want to pick VAV box as zone terminal in the model of detail data edit.  
   
  Does anyone know how to solve this problem?
   
  Thanks a lot

Break up the window so that the area of the window is less than the parent

complicated if you don't have your spaces sized right.

Message-ID: <000b01c8d60c$6e1460c0$2c01a8c0@rob>

Hello all,

 

I am trying to rerun a 5-year old PowerDOE model in eQuest.  

I was able to get the model to run in eQuest, but a comparison of the PS-E
reports

of the PowerDOE and eQuest versions shows significant differences in end
energy use,

particularly for heating, cooling and ventilation fans.  I had to make a
couple of changes

to the INP file before it would run in eQuest without errors, mainly
assigning system

defaults for CHW, HW, and Baseboard loops, and assigning a value for Zone
Reheat Delta T

to allow for reheat in VAV boxes.  Other than that, nothing was changed.

 

Does anyone have any suggestions as to why the energy use may have changed
so much

going from PowerDOE to eQuest with virtually the same INP file?  Are the
load calculations

or default equipment performances significantly different between eQuest and
PowerDOE?

 

Any input would be much appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Rob,

 

PowerDOE runs with a different version of DOE (the calculation engine behind
the PowerDOE and eQuest GUI software).  A recent presentation by some
analysts for a monthly meeting of the BSUG building modeling group compared
efforts to model the same building with PowerDOE, eQuest, and Trace showed
some wide variations in the end use splits.

Steve,

 

Glad to hear this, as this will be a good feature for eQuest.  In the past
when we've performed analysis on condensing boilers, we used performance data
from Aerco's website, such as: 

 

http://www.aerco.com/products/benchmark3-specs.shtml

 

There is a link at the top for the efficiency curves that take into account
return temperature and part load.  You should check with Aerco regarding
using the data, but I'm sure you guys could work out a deal with them and
other boiler manufacturers, similar to what you guys did with ClimateMaster,
to enable us to use custom curves for specific boilers.

 

It would be nice to have the capability to directly simulate the condensing
boilers in eQuest.  It would save us a bunch of additional steps that we
currently use.  The current method we use for simulating condensing boilers
is to first pull all hourly heating load and temperature data into a
spreadsheet.  Then, we calculate the efficiency for each hour based on the
load and temp conditions, and the Aerco performance curves.  Then, we use all
of those calcs to calculate the annual average efficiency, and then we enter
that number into eQuest along with a custom PLR curve and zero standby and
start-up times.  The custom PLR curve is a "y = m*x + B" type where m = 1 and
B = 0 so that the effects of part load are eliminated, since my annual
average efficiency number already takes this into account.    I believe this
is similar to what Marlin showed us in a training class about 2 years ago.

 

We usually come up with annual average efficiencies of about 90 to 91 %,
which seem reasonable.  Higher efficiencies are available in theory, but they
bump up against the fact that there is usually not much heating load when you
can get away with the lower temperatures required for the higher
efficiencies.  Therefore, the really high efficiencies (when present) don't
have much of an effect on the annual average number.

 

Hope this helps!

 

One question; if you guys are in the process of adding a few bells and
whistles to the eQuest program, would you mind if we (eQuest-users) submitted
additional "wish lists" items via this forum?

 

Thanks!

 

Regards,

 

James

Your idea regarding a "wish list" for new features in eQUEST is a good one.
It might be best to post requests to either the
equest-users at lists.onebuilding.org, or send them directly to me at

Message-ID: <cdf76d820806251458y2dabc628p5680f460426f8ae5@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm using the program WUFI to model moisture behavior in a wall section with
a rain screen, 1" air space and a 6" SIP panel. I'm modeling the SIP panel
as a OSB+EPS+OSB.

The existing design drawings have a Blueskin weather barrier which is both
air and vapor barrier between the air space and SIP panel. I modeled the
assembly with and without the weather barrier and see that moisture behavior
is pretty similar in both cases - it either gradually decreases or
stabilizes across all components/sensor locations. The results seem to point
out that there will be no condensation issues even without the weather
barrier.

Does anybody have any experience with similar issues? How are weather
barriers used in relation to SIP panels generally?

Thanks,

Multiple, small, low cost condensing boilers with self contained, condensing program controllers (up to eight boilers), give more operation time at higher efficiencies. Lochinvar's Knight boiler does this. By copy of this email, I am asking Lochinvar to participate in this project.

The eQUEST development team is in the process of implementing a condensing
boiler. We are looking for performance data, both for the effect of entering
temperature on fuel consumption, as well as the impact of part load
operating conditions on fuel consumption.  If you have information you are
willing to share, please contact me.

Steve,

 

Glad to hear this, as this will be a good feature for eQuest.  In the past
when we've performed analysis on condensing boilers, we used performance data
from Aerco's website, such as: 

 

http://www.aerco.com/products/benchmark3-specs.shtml

 

There is a link at the top for the efficiency curves that take into account
return temperature and part load.  You should check with Aerco regarding
using the data, but I'm sure you guys could work out a deal with them and
other boiler manufacturers, similar to what you guys did with ClimateMaster,
to enable us to use custom curves for specific boilers.

 

It would be nice to have the capability to directly simulate the condensing
boilers in eQuest.  It would save us a bunch of additional steps that we
currently use.  The current method we use for simulating condensing boilers
is to first pull all hourly heating load and temperature data into a
spreadsheet.  Then, we calculate the efficiency for each hour based on the
load and temp conditions, and the Aerco performance curves.  Then, we use all
of those calcs to calculate the annual average efficiency, and then we enter
that number into eQuest along with a custom PLR curve and zero standby and
start-up times.  The custom PLR curve is a "y = m*x + B" type where m = 1 and
B = 0 so that the effects of part load are eliminated, since my annual
average efficiency number already takes this into account.    I believe this
is similar to what Marlin showed us in a training class about 2 years ago.

 

We usually come up with annual average efficiencies of about 90 to 91 %,
which seem reasonable.  Higher efficiencies are available in theory, but they
bump up against the fact that there is usually not much heating load when you
can get away with the lower temperatures required for the higher
efficiencies.  Therefore, the really high efficiencies (when present) don't
have much of an effect on the annual average number.

 

Hope this helps!

 

One question; if you guys are in the process of adding a few bells and
whistles to the eQuest program, would you mind if we (eQuest-users) submitted
additional "wish lists" items via this forum?

 

Thanks!

 

Regards,

 

James

Thanks Jim,

 

Your idea regarding a "wish list" for new features in eQUEST is a good one.
It might be best to post requests to either the
equest-users at lists.onebuilding.org, or send them directly to me at
Steve.Gates at doe2.com. It would be best to not burden the main bldg-sim list
with requests specific to eQUEST.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Purchased Cool in ASHRAE Baseline case
Message-ID: <005601c8d758$856790b0$1bb2a8c0@ZAH>

Dear All,

I am doing a project whose cooling source is purchased chilled water from the district. Then what kind of cooling source should be modeled in ASHRAE baseline case? chillers or purchased chilled water?

It is only mentioned about Purchased Heat in ASHRAE90.1-2004. G.3.1.1 For systems using purchased hot water or steam, hot water or steam costs shall be based on actual utility rates, and on-site boilers shall not be modeled in the baseline building design. So how can I deal with the purchased cool? 

Thanks a lot for your help.

Dear all,

While writing an expression for window frame width of curtain walls in
eQuest 3.61, I am getting 'Expression parsing error' saying the user
expression is too long. The expression used is-
default :
PARENT("WIDTH")*PARENT("HEIGHT")*0.0464/(PARENT("WIDTH")+PARENT("HEIGHT"))

How should I modify or change it? 

Are there provisions for creating local variable by arithmetic operation on
present variables? For example, the length of this expression can be reduced
, if I calculate perimeter of parent wall first and use that value directly
in the expression.

Any help will be appreciated.

I just pasted the expression into one of my projects and it worked fine.
You may just need to allow the expression to go onto two lines like so:

PARENT("WIDTH")*PARENT("HEIGHT")*0.0464/
(PARENT("WIDTH")+PARENT("HEIGHT"))

Another way to shorten the expression is use #P instead of writing out
"Parent"

#P("WIDTH")*#P("HEIGHT")*0.0464/(#P("WIDTH")+#P("HEIGHT"))

Hope this helps

I have a mechanical room that is conditioned to 95 in cooling through
exhaust fans and heated to 65 with unit heaters.
 
Do the exhaust fans constitute as a cooling system?  The system would
need to provide a sensible capacity of 5 btu/h*ft2 for the mech room to
be considered to be a cooled space, which I have not yet calculated.
 
The reason I as is that if these exhaust fans are not considered a
cooling system then the baseline cooling system will need to be modeled
to complete an accurate LEED model.
 
Any suggestions?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Excess winter cooling load in eQuest
Message-ID: <48639FD6.5070008@aiguasol.coop>

Hello all,
I am finding an excess in winter cooling load when using DX coils for 
cooling and HW coils for heating with a Packaged VAV with HW reheat. The 
SS-C report shows a number of coincident cooling&heating load hours 
almos equal to the unexpected cooling loads. This that could be normal 
when the system serves many different zones, keeps on happening when I 
asign one system per zone. I need to change the heating source to 
Furnace  (for example Split System Single Zone DX with furnace) for 
getting rid of those winter cooling loads. Is there a way to manqage it 
with the Packaged VAV with HW reheat system?

On the other hand, from within the Wizards, the 'zone groups' assigned 
within each shell seem not to be available in the system assignement to 
thermal zones, and therefore, the system per area assignement overides 
the zone groups and their system assignements. Is it like this?

Hello!

 

Does anyone know why eQuest/DOE2.2 is not included in the list of qualified
software that can be used to apply for EPAct 2005 Federal Tax incentives?
The current list includes DOE-2.1-E and DOE-2.1E-JJH as well as Energy Plus,
VisualDOE, Trace 7000, and others.

 

It seems like eQuest is one of the more popular modeling software packages
used for LEED energy modeling - should I stop using it because DOE2.2 and
eQuest are not registered as qualifying software?  If Trace 7000 and
VisualDOE can be qualified, eQuest certainly should be.

 

Thanks,

 

Eric

Only DOE-2 input keyword values/selections can be referenced by BDL 
expressions.
That having been said, you CAN setup a numeric Global Parameter called 
"SupplyCFM", set its value manually following a sizing run and then 
reference that global param in your BDL expressions. The only downside 
here is that you have to manually update this global param each time the 
Supply CFM changes in order for your various (dependent) keywords to 
adjust to the new CFM value.

Message-ID: <25F2BDB6656B8F40A1289ED906D6B5CF038E0C9B@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I'm modeling a 20 story building in eQuest, and unfortunately can't
really use the floor multiplier option.
 
I am trying to add the very last floor, and eQuest appears to work if I
set one zone for the entire upper floor, but as soon as I start to
sub-divide the space (in Wizard mode) into more specific zones, the
program crashes, almost like I have exceeded the number of spaces that
either eQuest can handle, or my computer can handle.
 
does anyone have experience with this?  Is there really a maximum # of
spaces/zones that you can model?  For reference, it looks like my
building has just shy of 350 spaces/zones.

Hi Prabhat,

I'm glad it worked for you.  I have not worked in the user input expression
mode too much either, but did develop a way to calculate what direction a
window is facing and determine glass type based on this info.  I'm attaching
the text file with the module and instructions.

I found that the best resource for this is the help file.  Once help is
open, under contents go to: Volume 3: Topics --> Building Description
Language --> Keyword Expressions

When learning expressions, start with a very small expression, and try it
out.  Try running the file too to make sure there are no run-time errors as
a result of the expression.  Once you get a small piece working, add to it
slowly.  This will help you figure out exactly where your errors are.

Good luck!  I hope I can help with future questions.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQUEST - Daylight Penetration
Message-ID: <022001c8d863$10abde00$6400a8c0@yourb47d776523>

Dear All,

 

I have a question regarding solar gains through glazing in eQUEST.

My model has a tall narrow atrium with all glass on the south and north
facades.

The question is: does eQUEST account for the fact that the daylight incoming
through the south fa?ade will partly leave through the north fa?ade?

In other words, when eQUEST calculates hourly space loads, is the solar heat
gain from the south glass going to be broken down into two parts: one
staying in the space and one leaving the space?

 

Thank you all for help.

 

Kind regards,

Salah

Message-ID: <1901717528DF6E4EA2EEB294C11E785052B69B@MULTIORG1.cgnetmo.org>

Xavier,

I would check the minimum airflows for the VAV zones. 30% of maximum air flow is generally a code minimum (unless there is a critical space that needs a high fraction of ventilation, such as a conference room, or the cfm/sf is near 0.4). If your percentage is abnormally high, then the system will have a lot of reheat. Unfortunately the eQUEST wizard limits assigning different minimum airflow percentages to only two types of zones - core and perimeter - so it's harder to deal with a critical space that affects the ventilation fraction.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Excess winter cooling load in eQuest

Hello all,
I am finding an excess in winter cooling load when using DX coils for 
cooling and HW coils for heating with a Packaged VAV with HW reheat. The 
SS-C report shows a number of coincident cooling&heating load hours 
almos equal to the unexpected cooling loads. This that could be normal 
when the system serves many different zones, keeps on happening when I 
asign one system per zone. I need to change the heating source to 
Furnace  (for example Split System Single Zone DX with furnace) for 
getting rid of those winter cooling loads. Is there a way to manqage it 
with the Packaged VAV with HW reheat system?

On the other hand, from within the Wizards, the 'zone groups' assigned 
within each shell seem not to be available in the system assignement to 
thermal zones, and therefore, the system per area assignement overides 
the zone groups and their system assignements. Is it like this?

Regards,

We are pleased to announce the release of GenOpt 2.1.0.

GenOpt is a freely available open-source optimization program for the 
minimization of a cost function (such as annual energy use, peak 
electrical demand, utility cost, etc.) that is evaluated by an external 
simulation program.

For example, you can compute a building's annual energy cost in 
EnergyPlus, TRNSYS, IDA, DOE-2, or any simulation program with 
text-based input and output, and let GenOpt automatically find the 
values of selected parameters that yield lowest cost.

GenOpt has a library with local and global multi-dimensional and 
one-dimensional optimization algorithms, as well as algorithms for doing 
parametric studies.

Todd,

 

A good idea someone passed on to me is to make a real simple model in the
wizard, then take that to the detailed interface and you can see how eQuest
sets up and connects everything.

 

I had to do this earlier this week because I had a heavily developed model
that was already in the detailed interface.  I had to change the system type
from air cooled chillers and AHU's to ground source heat pumps with a loop
and a ground HX.  I couldn't go back to the wizard because I would lose lots
of other valuable inputs.  Therefore,  I studied the simple example model in
order to see how to set up everything correctly in my detailed model and it
worked.  

 

One thing I didn't know is that eQuest uses the "Pkgd Var Vol Var Temp"
system for a WSHP/GSHP system.  But, the option for "WL/GS Ht Pump" is set to
"Yes", the condenser type is set to "Water Cooled" and the CW Loop is
assigned to my "GSHP Loop".  Previously, I tried using the "Water Loop HP"
air system type and I couldn't get the program to work, even though that
system seemed like the intuitive air system choice.  In my case, I had my
loop and ground HX defined and in place before configuring my air systems so
that I had a loop to assign the air systems to.  I would define the loop
first, then the ground HX.  Within the ground HX, the "Circulation Loop
Assignment" parameter is where you assign the HX to your loop.

 

Hope this rambling helps a bit ...

 

Regards,

Hello,

 

I'm sure this has been addressed at some point, but does anyone have
experience or tutorials in setting up ground source heat pump loops in
eQuest?  I have been able to set up the ground source heat exchanger, but I'm
unsure of the methods and limitations for linking the ground source loop to
the water/water or water/air heat pump component.  Are both situations
possible?  For an airside device, would I set up the ground loop, then set up
the airside device and select the particular water source loop with which to
link it?

 

Thanks in advance for any advice.

I'm trying to simulate the possible energy savings from heating the slab
floor of a refrigerated warehouse using heat reclaim from the compressor
racks. The baseline would be electric heating.

Can anyone share their experiences with me please, I'm still quite new with

My thoughts on this would be that your main system should be sized to
provide the fresh air at your cooling temperature to replace the air
rejected by the exhaust, and you will probably find this is happening
unless your space is negatively pressurized.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G: Cooled space?

 

I have a mechanical room that is conditioned to 95 in cooling through
exhaust fans and heated to 65 with unit heaters.

 

Do the exhaust fans constitute as a cooling system?  The system would
need to provide a sensible capacity of 5 btu/h*ft2 for the mech room to
be considered to be a cooled space, which I have not yet calculated.

 

The reason I as is that if these exhaust fans are not considered a
cooling system then the baseline cooling system will need to be modeled
to complete an accurate LEED model.

 

Any suggestions?

 

Tim.

I believe eQUEST can handle up to 1024 zones.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] max spaces in eQuest?

 

I'm modeling a 20 story building in eQuest, and unfortunately can't really
use the floor multiplier option.

 

I am trying to add the very last floor, and eQuest appears to work if I set
one zone for the entire upper floor, but as soon as I start to sub-divide
the space (in Wizard mode) into more specific zones, the program crashes,
almost like I have exceeded the number of spaces that either eQuest can
handle, or my computer can handle.

 

does anyone have experience with this?  Is there really a maximum # of
spaces/zones that you can model?  For reference, it looks like my building
has just shy of 350 spaces/zones.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] FW: Interstitial condensations
Message-ID: <20080630212405.CC8BA48003@diego.dreamhost.com>

Dear all,

 

I wonder if anyone knows of software that can calculate interstitial
condensation within a construction which separates two conditioned zones.
For example, on the one side (first floor) there is an Ice Rink and on the
other side (floor below) a Swimming Pool. The two zones interface through a
multilayer internal floor slab. We need to assess the risk of condensation
and decide where the vapour barriers should be.

 

Most of the software I have seen, including the dynamic ones, assume the
moisture transfer between the outdoor and indoor conditions. In this case we
have maintained conditions on both side for most of the duration of a day,
so it cannot be considered as cyclic condition. Furthermore, the ice is a
layer at a constant temperature attached to the floor slab, which is not
dealt with in any of the software I have seen. 

 

Would be grateful for your advice.

 

 

Foroutan Parand

with SimBuild 2008!  

* DesignBuilder
* EnergyPlus
* eQUEST
* IES Virtual Environment
* Star-CD
* TRNSYS

The workshops will be held on campus at the University of California on
the Monday and Tuesday preceding the conference (July 28-29) and on the

SimBuild 2008
http://www.ibpsa.us/simbuild2008/

IBPSA-USA will hold its third national conference from July 30 to August
1,
2008 on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley.  The
format will be similar to the two previous SimBuild conferences held at
the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2004 and at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 2006.

The meeting is open to all, world-wide.  Being near San Francisco,
Berkeley is a convenient destination for travelers from major cities in
the U.S. and in many other countries.  U.C. Berkeley is the oldest
campus of the University of California system, which also operates the
well-known Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Lawrence Hall of
Science, the Space Sciences Laboratory, and the U.C. Botanical Garden.
The city of Berkeley contains a variety of neighborhoods with diverse
character and excellent restaurants.  The "Bay Area" is full of visitor
attractions accessible within 20 minutes, such as the city of San
Francisco, scenic mountains, and rich architecture (including the Frank
Lloyd Wright Civic Center).  Numerous wineries are within one hour
travel to the Napa and Sonoma valleys, where wine-tasting tours are
available.

We look forward to welcoming you to Berkeley!
