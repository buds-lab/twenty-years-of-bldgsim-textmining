Brendan,
I suppose there is a trade off between the options of all buildings in one
file and individual models.
The all buildings in one file option treats other buildings as shading
objects in E+ and as wind shields & shading in design builder, but does not
allow for the use of zone multipliers.

The individual model option allows for zone multipliers and this means
shorter simulation run time.

So I guess it depends on your use; if you want fast run time, single models
are best but if you want to model the geographical features more accurately
than multi model would be best.  If you set the project up in DB, then
export to E+ than the other models will be shading objects, for existing
buildings this is what I like to do.
The logic is that for existing buildings the owners are likely to make
changes to individual zones, so use of zone multipliers may not provide
useful info.

hope this helps and best of regards-

Bldg-simmers -

We are less than a month away from the University of Idaho Integrated
Design Lab's week long EnergyPlus and Radiance Workshop: Modeling Energy
Efficient Buildings.  There are slots still available for the full training
and half day options.  We will be closing registration post February 15th
at 5.00pm MST, and reserve the right to cancel the training on or before
this date due to insufficient enrollment.

This is a great opportunity for beginners just learning how to use
OpenStudio, EnergyPlus, and Radiance for whole building energy and daylight
simulation.  Additionally, intermediate users will gain new, valuable
skills and insights into the workflow used by the University of Idaho
Integrated Design Lab on consulting and research projects.  Everything from
geometry creation, night flush ventilation, daylight rendering/simulation,
and advanced HVAC system definition will be covered!  Advanced users are
welcome to attend the training and hone their existing modeling skill
sets while hopefully learning something new.

The City of Boise is also boasts a pedestrian-friendly urban environment
that is packed full of diverse amenities including: abundant local
restaurants and craft breweries, beautiful desert wilderness adjacent to
the city, and a charming, walkable downtown.

Please email jdunn at uidaho.edu with any inquiries and questions!

Check out the full flyer here:

Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E800FDFA8E5@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues:

In Short


?         We have new DAYSIM version (4.0) plus web site. Check it out at http://daysim.ning.com/.

?         Andy McNeil from LBNL kindly added a new DAYSIM discussion list to Radiance Online at http://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists/archives/radiance-daysim.


For those interested in the details

Apart from offering a download link for the latest DAYSIM version, the new site also offers an interactive API documentation that describe all DAYSIM subprograms and header file keywords<http://daysim.ning.com/page/daysim-header-file>. Focus users of the site are Daysim expert users who want to go beyond the capabilities of the various DAYSIM GUIs (see below) as well as third party GUI developers who want to implement DAYSIM into their programs. The development of the site was supported by the US Department of Energy Energy-Efficiency HUB<http://www.eebhub.org/about-eebhub>. (Thank you to all US tax payers among you.) The current DAYSIM development team includes MIT, the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) and Penn State University (PSU). With the new version come a few  changes and new features.

DAYSIM GUIs
Given the rising number of DAYSIM GUIs, we decided to phase out the old, rather unattractive JAVA GUI that came with the old Daysim and instead rely on third parties to develop plug-ins. In case you are still interested in using the old GUI, you can still  download Daysim 3.1e from the new web site. DAYSIM GUIs that I am aware are listed below. If your GUI is missing or if the table below misrepresents a software, please let me know.

Annual Glare Analysis
Daysim 4.0 includes and improved, more robust version of gen_dgp_profile<http://daysim.ning.com/subprogramgendgpprofile> written by Jan Wienold (ISE). The program calculates annual daylight glare probabilities profiles at selected view points within a scene based on a Radiance scene file, a Radiance View File and an epw weather file.


DYNAMIC SHADING MODULE
With support from SAGE Electrochromic we implemented the capability to model show shading groups independently in Daysim. This allows users to model a variety of rather complicated dynamic facades<http://daysim.ning.com/page/daysim-header-file-keyword-advanced-dynamic-shading>.


Electric Lighting
The shading module can be integrated with various electric lighting controls. Rick Mistrick (PSU) is currently expanding the list of supported controls. PSU is also working on a new DAYSIM program that allows to explicitly model and control electric light sources using IES files. There will also be a module that supports the placement of photo sensors within a scene. We expect these new programs to make their way into DAYSIM later this year.


Happy Daylight Simulations,

Message-ID: <45F8782E55EE2447A5AB9754140F3AC648DD2D@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

Hi All,

 

Does anyone have clarity on modeling OA flow rates in laboratory spaces,
specifically how they relate to the LEED baseline requirement for OA
flow when the proposed model has DCV?  

 

We have a client that wants a specific ACH rate (100% OA, once-thru
system) that is well above the ASHRAE 62.1 OA requirements for
laboratory space in Table 6-1.  We would like to use VAV hoods,
occupancy-based exhaust modulation, etc.  But since this is considered
DCV, is GBCI really going to require us to bring the lab OA volume(flow
reduction) in the proposed system?

 

Thanks for any advice!

Hi James,

 

In a recent project we used a combination of CFD, the 62.1 IAQ procedure,
and short-term exposure limits from OHS regulations to verify the ACH rate.
The VRP rates were comparatively low.  For an acetone spill event we arrived
at a figure of 8 ACH.  The baseline, then, would be the same.  We had DCV on
the system, but not for lab spaces where ventilation flow was simply turned
down at night.

James,

See this thread for some background on the subject:
http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/equest-users-onebuilding.org/2011-October/010327.html

Most likely, you are correct in thinking that you will have to model the Baseline with ASHRAE minimum requirements if you model the Proposed with DCV. Potentially, you could justify modeling the baseline using a local (or campus?) OA requirement if it is more stringent that ASHRAE 62.1.

If you keep the OA requirement identical between the baseline and proposed models, there are still opportunities for energy savings:

*         from energy recovery (if it is not required in the Baseline per G3.1.2.10)

*         from increased baseline fan power due to pressure drop adjustments (Return and/or exhaust airflow control devices, others in Table 6.5.3.1.1B)

*         from VAV hoods (this is trickier, but if the baseline system type is not variable, such as System 3 or 4 per G3.1.1 exception c., the baseline flow might be autosized at a higher CFM that the proposed design, and will not be 100% OA. If you model a reduced OA requirement at night, which is typical and also required in G3.1.1 exception d., the baseline will still have to run at 100% design flow but with a lower OA%, while the proposed model can ramp down to save fan energy.)

Regards,
Bill

Also - when you switch from a standard VAV system to a chilled beam system in a heat gain driven lab there is some reduction. For instance if your EHS mandated ACH is 6ACH, and thermal loads require you to go up to 8ACH to meet the cooling needs, that 8ACH has to be 100% OA (sine you cannot return lab air). A Chilled beam system would allow you to hold the air changes at 6ACH.

Sorry, that last sentence didn't make any sense (thanks Bill).  Should read:

We have a client that wants a specific ACH rate (100% OA, once-thru system) that is well above the ASHRAE 62.1 OA requirements for laboratory space in Table 6-1.

Thanks for the replies everyone!

 

I forgot to mention that this is a LEED v4 project, and the verbiage in
90.1-2010 has changed a little bit.

 

With lab exhaust systems > 5,000 CFM (which ours has), you have to
either have a 50% effective heat recovery device, or the ability to
throttle back non-regulated zones to 50% of the exhaust / makeup air
when not used (there i a fancy equation if you want to combine partial
heat recovery and partial flow reduction).  I think you also have the
option to provide direct makeup air that is simply tempered to within a
few degrees of the space setpoint.

 

So I guess this answers the question for me - I'll end up modeling DCV
for both the proposed and baseline (to 50% of peak ACH for baseline, and
whatever we decide for the proposed), along with heat recovery for the
proposed.  I won't have to bring the OA for the baseline all the way
down to ASHRAE 62 values per G3.1.2.11 and 6.5.6.1/6.5.7.2.  The other
option is to model 100% full ACH flow for the baseline system along with
a 50% effective heat recovery device, and see if that is more/less
efficient than the other baseline option.

 

Since G3.1.2.11 in 90.1-2010 now references Section 6, and 6.5.6.1
references 6.5.7.2 which gives multiple options for compliance, it
sounds like there are multiple baseline options for laboratory systems
with exhaust > 5,000 CFM in the new LEED v4.

 

I wonder if GBCI will provide a ruling on this to clarify down the
road...

Also - when you switch from a standard VAV system to a chilled beam
system in a heat gain driven lab there is some reduction. For instance
if your EHS mandated ACH is 6ACH, and thermal loads require you to go up
to 8ACH to meet the cooling needs, that 8ACH has to be 100% OA (sine you
cannot return lab air). A Chilled beam system would allow you to hold
the air changes at 6ACH.

James,

 

See this thread for some background on the subject:

http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/equest-users-onebuilding.org/2011
-October/010327.html

 

Most likely, you are correct in thinking that you will have to model the
Baseline with ASHRAE minimum requirements if you model the Proposed with
DCV. Potentially, you could justify modeling the baseline using a local
(or campus?) OA requirement if it is more stringent that ASHRAE 62.1.

 

If you keep the OA requirement identical between the baseline and
proposed models, there are still opportunities for energy savings:

?         from energy recovery (if it is not required in the Baseline
per G3.1.2.10)

?         from increased baseline fan power due to pressure drop
adjustments (Return and/or exhaust airflow control devices, others in
Table 6.5.3.1.1B)

?         from VAV hoods (this is trickier, but if the baseline system
type is not variable, such as System 3 or 4 per G3.1.1 exception c., the
baseline flow might be autosized at a higher CFM that the proposed
design, and will not be 100% OA. If you model a reduced OA requirement
at night, which is typical and also required in G3.1.1 exception d., the
baseline will still have to run at 100% design flow but with a lower
OA%, while the proposed model can ramp down to save fan energy.)

 

Regards,

Bill

I think you need to define "automatically" carefully.
DesignBuilder does a fair amount of the work and Simergy intends to do something similar.
As an example, the proper ASHRAE 90.1 EER / COP is not known until you actually run the simulation and find out the capacity.  It seems to me that some of the criteria must be ascertained from a successful simulation before you can have a complete Baseline.
Another example that has been discussed in this forum  is calculating the proper fan and pump pressure rise to comply with 90.1

That is a good point Jim. To actually generate a baseline following either of the protocols, it is necessary to first do a sizing run. So the automation would need to be a two-step process.

I think you need to define "automatically" carefully.
DesignBuilder does a fair amount of the work and Simergy intends to do something similar.
As an example, the proper ASHRAE 90.1 EER / COP is not known until you actually run the simulation and find out the capacity.  It seems to me that some of the criteria must be ascertained from a successful simulation before you can have a complete Baseline.
Another example that has been discussed in this forum  is calculating the proper fan and pump pressure rise to comply with 90.1

If you have waterside systems it really becomes three steps:

1)      Run with all guesses to determine airside sizing

2)      Run with determined airside sizing and guessed waterside sizing

3)      Run with known airside and waterside sizing

Then the complications of the rotations and satisfying unmet hours criteria.
If you view modeling like a video game with level to achieve and get a good soundtrack, then you can be happily oblivious about how much time you are spending on it.

You do need to be careful about "automatic" - it's a complex thing to fully automate.  There are more exceptions than rules.

IES VE has a PRM Navigator which automates baselines for both 90.1-2004 and 2007 following the PRM methodology (Appendix G).

The PRM Navigator does auto-generate much of the baseline - but also allows the user to go in and see and "break" or edit the baseline as needed for different conditions.

Echoing everyone's caution for "Automatic" - I think it also depends on what you are using it for. If it's for a detailed compliance modeling, then I would really caution against it. If it's for quick EEM explorations I am sure it's a simpler matter.

What I was really interested in is software that does the whole process automatically. No manipulation on the part of the user at all. You input a proposed building design, and following one of the rulesets results are generated. Does that exist and if it does, for which protocols?

As far as I'm aware, nothing like that exists.  Nor could it, ASHRAE 90.1 is too complex to make something like that make every decision automated.

I am hoping the building simulation community can help answer a question for me. What software packages out there automatically generate baseline models for the ASHRAE 90.1 Energy Cost Budget Methodology or Appendix G? Thanks.

I would say that the LEED plugin for IDA ICE 4.5 does a pretty good job. 
For most buildings you need very little manupilation.

As far as I'm aware, nothing like that exists.  Nor could it, ASHRAE 90.1 
is too complex to make something like that make every decision automated.

Echoing everyone?s caution for ?Automatic? ? I think it also depends on 
what you are using it for. If it?s for a detailed compliance modeling, 
then I would really caution against it. If it?s for quick EEM explorations 
I am sure it?s a simpler matter.

You do need to be careful about ?automatic? ? it?s a complex thing to 
fully automate.  There are more exceptions than rules.
 
IES VE has a PRM Navigator which automates baselines for both 90.1-2004 
and 2007 following the PRM methodology (Appendix G).
 
The PRM Navigator does auto-generate much of the baseline ? but also

Energypro from Energysoft does a 90.1 Appendix G baseline
and comparison with the proposed too and generally is good enough for LEED
reviewer. Not very permeable though, so you need two learn DOE2 to really
understand what you are modelling.

Bldg-simmers -

We are happy to announce that our week-long EnergyPlus and Radiance
Training on Feb 25th will now incorporate a session on using EnergyPlus's
new variable refrigerant flow (VRF) modeling capability.

This is a new feature of EnergyPlus as of version 7.0, which came out at
the end of 2011.  Version 7.2 has expanded the functionality of the system
and included inherent heat recovery and water-cooled condenser options.
 Our lab has had a chance to use this new system on two consulting projects
and was able to incorporate it at the last moment into our training.

We are about a week away from our cutoff date (Feb 15, 5.00 MST), but still
have slots available for the full week or just portions of the workshop.

Please email jdunn at uidaho.edu with any inquiries and questions!

I should add that users can chose to create the app g baseline models and modify them if necessary or chose to simply run them at simulation time.

AECOsim Energy Simulator does check the HVAC systems and sizing before creating the models. The HVAC systems are automatically created based on preconfigured HVAC systems. (All done with EnergyPlus v7.2).

I am hoping the building simulation community can help answer a question for me. What software packages out there automatically generate baseline models for the ASHRAE 90.1 Energy Cost Budget Methodology or Appendix G? Thanks.

Thank you for sharing, Dru. I am curious, what process AECOsim uses to
model G3.1.3.5 and G3.1.3.10 requirements for hot- and chilled-water pumps,
as they are not direct inputs,

Hi Attiq,

It's easy to blur how "thermal zoning" should/shouldn't be handled without sufficient context.  Recognize that this term can have slightly different implications/definitions when you are discussing HVAC design, energy modeling, and LEED/90.1 requirements.  Context is critical.

More specifically, there are often multiple right answers to how you can choose to define thermal zones for a given model: rest assured it will be your call to make (and justify) in the end.  I generally start by defining which areas are covered by the different conditioning systems.  Then, if you have multizone systems, divide those floor areas up into zones with respect to the associated system.  One way to think of that is "one zone per thermostat."  These zones may or may not be defined by interior partitions.

Further, if the model's complexity is anticipated to be unwieldy down the road, I'll consider consolidating zones with similar load profiles, occupancy characteristics, & systems (i.e. a series of contiguous private offices along a shared perimeter).  90.1 and the 90.1 User's manual go into more depth in regards to what is considered acceptable.  Also, be mindful of procedural limitations for your energy modeling software/tools of choice when making these zoning simplification decisions - your chosen software may dictate to what extent this even makes sense from a time-efficiency perspective.

Specific to LEED and multi-tenanted buildings, it has been my experience that LEED reviewers will demand the most recent tenant layouts/information at the time of model review be incorporated into the model.  If your present design includes any un-tenanted "shell" space for future tenants, you'd be well advised to plan ahead as you assemble your model for how you might address needing to re-zone parts of the project in the indeterminate future.  Additionally, I have read LEED core & shell includes guidelines for how to address the future loads of such spaces (Equipment, LPD's and so forth), though I believe you can choose to document different figures if there are building performance specs the future tenants are to be held to.
Best of luck!

Hi list members:

 

Anybody knows the definition of Density of Air (DENSTY) in the weather file
for eQUEST/DOE-2? The unit is (LB/CU FT), but I am not sure whether it is
pound of dry air or moisture air. Thanks for any suggestion.

 

Regards

 

Jianhua

Message-ID: <513FDF89A7D69F45AC14DF0C92C70CD0388E2850@Exchange-oma.meg.local>

Building Simulation Community -

I'm having issues with humidity in some models I'm running while trying to use ApacheHVAC. I have set my "Maximum Percent Saturation" to 50%, and in the VE ASHRAE Loads Results Data tab of the loads data spreadsheet it shows that max input as 50%. If I go into Vista and highlight my "filename.asp" file for the run that is linked to my ApacheHVAC system and run the "Heating and Cooling Report" and look at the "Comfort - Occupied" section all of my rooms have a Max% Relative Humidity of 85-100%. This is the same if I select "Systems" from the drop down and investigate Relative Humidity on a node by node basis at the rooms in my ApacheHVAC system.

Rooms in my model that are not assigned to an ApacheHVAC system and are left with the default ApacheSystems system show that they are being maintained at 50% RH.

All rooms whether assigned to the ApacheHVAC systems or the default systems show that they're letting room temperatures float to Unoccupied setpoints during the "Comfort - Occupied" times.

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated, the buildings I'm trying to work on are located in Louisville, KY and Tampa, FL so not accounting for dehumidification is going to vastly effect the cooling load.

Thanks,

Dear fellow energy modelers,
*
*
*We (myself and more than 100 other modelers) want to make answers more
accessible to the building energy modeling community. There are many venues
(usually forums or mailing lists like this one) where modelers are already
asking questions, but, though these services include an archive of all
previous questions, answers, discussions, and announcements, they lack the
organization and structure to make the knowledge base of answers easily
accessible.*
*
The computer programming community has faced this same problem and has come
up with a solution called stackoverflow.com <http://stackoverflow.com/about>,
a website that focuses entirely on providing answers. The Stack Overflow
platform relies on the community to up-vote good answers to increase the
visibility for others who may ask the same question in the future. When
others vote for your answers you gain "reputation points" that help
establish your expertise in the community, which in turn provides a better
incentive to provide answers even to the most beginner-level questions.

Since launching in 2008, Stack Overflow has been extremely successful:
boasting 17 million unique visitors and 8.3 million answers! The success of
Stack Overflow has led to several other question and answer
sites<http://stackexchange.com/sites>from
photography <http://photo.stackexchange.com/> to
cooking<http://cooking.stackexchange.com/>to Jewish
law <http://judaism.stackexchange.com/>, all using the same platform as
Stack Overflow and successfully supporting their respective communities.

We would like to do the same for the building energy modeling community,
but before we can launch a fully functional site we need your help to prove
that we have a large enough active community to support such a site and to
help establish the scope of support the site will offer. This is the only
requirement to use Stack Oveflow's platform; it is completely free and open
to the public.

Please visit our proposal:

2. Up-voting questions that help establish the scope of our community (We

voting for questions that do not yet have 10 votes!)
3. Proposing your own example questions

Hi Neal,

I applaud you for this effort, and I just signed in to take part.  However,
the StackOverflow point system is very frustrating.  The site fluctuates
between telling me that I have a reputation of 51, and then a reputation of
1.  I was able to upvote a few questions, but now the site thinks that I
have a reputation of 1, and so I can't take part in the discussion.  I'm
not sure if others have had the same experiences, but I'd be curious to
know.  I know that you are limited to the number of votes you can cast over
the course of a day, but do you loose "reputation" for upvoting other posts?

Karen,

Thanks for bringing this up. There are a few steps that you need to go
through before you can vote:

1. Follow the site<http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/45232/building-performance-simulation-analysis>(this
requires that you enter an email address)

[image: Inline image 3]

2. Confirm your address (an email will automatically be generated and sent
to the address you enter)


3. Register for an account (until you register you will have only 1
reputation point)

[image: Inline image 2]

4. After you register you will be given 50 more points and the privilege to
vote. This also gives you a chance to change your name from the generic
userXXXXX.

It may take a while for the Stack Exchange servers to update and get
everything ready for you to participate. It looks like you now have 51
points and you've used all 5 of your votes. Let me know if you are still
having trouble.

Thanks,

Neal Kruis

Difficult to diagnose from your description but certain zone level system
settings become redundant when you use aphvac.

Are you using the controllers in aphvac to control humidity via coils or
are you expecting aphvac to the "find" settings in your zone "room
conditions"tab?

It's not always obvious what settings become redundant.

I'm using all prototype systems, and they all have humidity controllers attached to the coil/room when imported.  Looking at those controllers they have a setpoint of 50% RH with a 10% deadband.  I don't know if that's standard with the prototype systems or if it's pulling that from my room conditions tab, but either way everything seems to be pointing to 50% RH.

Rooms in my model that are not assigned to an ApacheHVAC system and are left with the default ApacheSystems system show that they are being maintained at 50% RH.

All rooms whether assigned to the ApacheHVAC systems or the default systems show that they're letting room temperatures float to Unoccupied setpoints during the "Comfort - Occupied" times.

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated, the buildings I'm trying to work on are located in Louisville, KY and Tampa, FL so not accounting for dehumidification is going to vastly effect the cooling load.

Hi all,

As a follower of multiple lists such as BLDG-SIM, TRNSYS, EnergyPlus, etc.,
I've often been frustrated with email support lists. For one, if you
subscribe late, you miss out on searching the archive of answers, leading
to questions being asked multiple times. Two, many questions spill across
multiple lists, also a redundancy.

I can see a real benefit in using the Stack Exchange model and the
connected potential for building a real online community of building
simulation professionals. The whole concept is based on voting for
questions and answers. Without this participation, the site cannot
function.

With over 100 followers, this concept has momentum. If it is realized, it
will be a fundamental shift in how we all interact. Critically, it will
shift traffic away from the traditional tool Q&A lists, potentially
splitting user communities. This might influence how vendors communicate
with their users. How will you react?

I am an avid supporter of the idea, but we need an educated and community
supported transition, so please learn about this "new" technology, and ask
questions!

The proposal:
http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/45232/building-performance-simulation-analysis

Right now, the proposal in the "definition" phase. What types of questions
define our community?

(Follow & Upvote!)

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DesignBuilder Simulation Training, London, March 18-22nd
Message-ID: <A0E02212526D2847B8F1F78E9A5B17C901BEB3B1C7F1@DBSERVER01.designbuilder.local>

Please excuse cross postings.

DesignBuilder are offering a 5-day modular training course in central London March 18-22. The course will be an excellent opportunity to find out from the experts how to get the most out of DesignBuilder and learn best practice modelling techniques. Days 1-4 are suitable for less experienced users and the Detailed HVAC Day 5 is suitable for experienced DesignBuilder users as well as attendees of days 1-4. The course is structured to give you plenty of worked examples so you can 'learn by doing'.

Summary of course contents:


*         Day 1, 18th March, Modeller. The aim of the day is to provide trainees with the knowledge required to confidently set up building geometry using blocks, zone up and define and select constructions and glazing.

*         Day 2, 19th March, Basic Simulation. Introduces heating and cooling design, solar, lighting, HVAC and scheduled natural ventilation, data entry and basic simulation.

*         Day 3, 20th March, Calculated Natural Ventilation and CFD. A two part day starting with sessions on EnergyPlus calculated natural ventilation, leading on to an introduction to CFD covering both internal and external CFD including linked EnergyPlus and CFD simulations

*         Day 4, 21st March, Daylighting & Introduction to Detailed HVAC. A two part day, starting with use of Radiance Daylighting for design and LEED/BREEAM assessments, followed by an introduction to Detailed HVAC illustrated through use of the new v3.2 HVAC templates.

*         Day 5, 22nd March, Detailed HVAC. This day provides a deeper study of some the latest DesignBuilder EnergyPlus HVAC functionality covering a range of common systems and control methods. The new simulation results viewer will be used to check EnergyPlus HVAC outputs in detail.

60 day licenses for the full DesignBuilder software suite will be provided.

For more details on course content, prices and booking forms please see:

Kevin,

 

Is this not because the room heat loads and cooling loads calculation sheet
pulls results from your .clg and .htg files not your .aps file?

I'm using all prototype systems, and they all have humidity controllers
attached to the coil/room when imported.  Looking at those controllers they
have a setpoint of 50% RH with a 10% deadband.  I don't know if that's
standard with the prototype systems or if it's pulling that from my room
conditions tab, but either way everything seems to be pointing to 50% RH.

Difficult to diagnose from your description but certain zone level system
settings become redundant when you use aphvac. 

Are you using the controllers in aphvac to control humidity via coils or are
you expecting aphvac to the "find" settings in your zone "room
conditions"tab?

It's not always obvious what settings become redundant.

that max input as 50%. If I go into Vista and highlight my "filename.asp"
file for the run that is linked to my ApacheHVAC system and run the "Heating

rooms have a Max% Relative Humidity of 85-100%. This is the same if I select
"Systems" from the drop down and investigate Relative Humidity on a node by
node basis at the rooms in my ApacheHVAC system.

Rooms in my model that are not assigned to an ApacheHVAC system and are left
with the default ApacheSystems system show that they are being maintained at
50% RH.

All rooms whether assigned to the ApacheHVAC systems or the default systems
show that they're letting room temperatures float to Unoccupied setpoints
during the "Comfort - Occupied" times.

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated, the buildings I'm trying to
work on are located in Louisville, KY and Tampa, FL so not accounting for
dehumidification is going to vastly effect the cooling load.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <770DA51B8CC79343A32830010D6E379A0A688F@PJWXMB-0001L.LEC-ADMIN.dmu.ac.uk>

Hi All,

Sorry for cross-posting... We are starting the second round trial of jEPlus Simulation Server (JESS). The first round was open to jEPlus users and DesignBuilder competition participants only. This time it is open to everyone who is willing to have a taste of "cloud computing". You can send jEPlus projects or plain EnergyPlus simulation jobs to the DMU cluster, and then sit back waiting for results to come back. This page explains how it works: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jeplus/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:jess_service

All you need to do is following a few simple steps:

1.       Log on to jEPlus website, register a new account if you are not yet a user, and download the JESS Client (with EP-Launch Support) package

2.       Send an email to jeplus.services at gmail.com<mailto:jeplus.services at gmail.com>, and ask for a JESS account. Please indicate in the email the type of jobs you intend to run

3.       Depending on your simulation jobs, separate instructions on how to use the Client are provided on the website

Since the number of accounts we can offer is limited, they will be provided on first come first served basis. If the demand is high, it may take a couple of days before we get back to you. This is a free trial, i.e. we are not charging you anything  for using this facility. However, running E+ simulations remotely can cause high data traffic, so be careful if your internet connection is not unlimited. The trial will run for at least 6 weeks starting today.

Best regards,

Yi

Kevin,

Depending on your system, if you've got high levels of infiltration in a high humidity area, large latent loads within the spaces etc. downstream or room RH could potentially be high. Otherwise, if it's not meeting the off-coil RH, either you've got a profile issue (your coil is effectively off) or some part of your system is undersized. You'll need to interrogate step by step to find the issue.

Taking Chris' point further ApacheHVAC doesn't 'look' at any value from your Room Conditions tab. In that respect it's a dumb beast. It's up to you to make sure the room conditions and setpoint controllers within ApacheHVAC match, so that your loads and your coil/airflow sizing tie up.

Hope that helps,
Ed

Absolutely!  I regularly use COMcheck to document my proposed LPD tallies and the corresponding baseline LPD inputs.

The only caveat to be aware of is that COMcheck presently cannot document 90.1-2007 inclusive of addendum i, which is of concern if you specifically are determining/documenting exterior lighting wattages for SSc8 for LEED 2009 projects registered after November 2011.  I've contacted the developers, and from the response I understand they do not intend to address this issue.

Further reading/information in the attached discussion.

Christian,

Your question is a bit puzzling, since COMcheck doesn?t literally ?report? LPDs.  It reveals the allowable LPDs based on the energy code specified by the user at input time; but it?s the responsibility of the user to input the actual (proposed) LPDs by either the whole-building method or the space-by-space method.  COMcheck only tells you whether you?re exceeding the code limitation you specified.  

I would think that you could always rely on the soundness of the ?allowable? LPDs shown in COMcheck, since they are reflecting the code requirements.  However, and energy simulation model inputs always need to be the LPDs that are actually in the building design.

Regards,

Larry

Hi Larry,

To read it another way, COMcheck literally does generate compliance reports which document proposed and allowable LPD?s in an itemized fashion.  I answered previously assuming Christian is asking specifically about whether the reports themselves are considered acceptable documentation for LPD tallies/calcs.

Such reports, while intended to document prescriptive code compliance, can serve double-duty as effective LEED model documentation for derived LPD inputs (and other credits).  Since LEED EAc1 modeling requires documenting both the baseline and proposed model LPD?s (which correspond to the prescribed allowable and installed watts, respectively), I?ve found COMcheck compliance reports to be quite a timesaver over the self-made spreadsheets I used to assemble.

The .cck files incidentally, by nature of their common structure, are also easier to pass around with other designers to pick up and work with, relative to a ?roll your own documentation? approach.

Christian,

Your question is a bit puzzling, since COMcheck doesn?t literally ?report? LPDs.  It reveals the allowable LPDs based on the energy code specified by the user at input time; but it?s the responsibility of the user to input the actual (proposed) LPDs by either the whole-building method or the space-by-space method.  COMcheck only tells you whether you?re exceeding the code limitation you specified.

I would think that you could always rely on the soundness of the ?allowable? LPDs shown in COMcheck, since they are reflecting the code requirements.  However, and energy simulation model inputs always need to be the LPDs that are actually in the building design.

Regards,

Larry

Can anyone tell me if the LPD as reported by COMcheck is a sound input for whole building energy performance simulation programs? If not, why not?

Thank you in advance!

COMcheck LPDs are based on inputs made by design team when documenting code
compliance. Quality of these inputs depend on how seriously energy code is
taken by design team and code officials, and vary from project to project.
In my experience, they are often way off, and seem to be taken out of thin
air. Aside from that, based on Table G3.1, Proposed Building Performance
column ".a. Where a complete lighting system exists, the actual lighting
power for each thermal block shall be used in the model." LPDs by thermal
block are not entered/reported in COMCheck, so I don't really see how
COMCheck LPDs may be used in the model even if they were correct.

Absolutely!  I regularly use COMcheck to document my proposed LPD tallies
and the corresponding baseline LPD inputs.

 

The only caveat to be aware of is that COMcheck presently cannot document
90.1-2007 inclusive of addendum i, which is of concern if you specifically
are determining/documenting exterior lighting wattages for SSc8 for LEED
2009 projects registered after November 2011.  I've contacted the
developers, and from the response I understand they do not intend to address
this issue.

Hi List!

Here's some additional clarification resulting from some off-list discussion:

In my experience, the person demonstrating energy code compliance and the person doing the energy modeling is often the same person (me!), so I'm writing from a perspective that it's a given the COMcheck reports are assembled with the same rigor expected of the energy model.  In function, I personally recognize COMcheck reports as a time-saving tool to simultaneously document model inputs while demonstrating code compliance.

Those providing energy modeling services independent of those producing compliance documentation should at least make themselves aware that there may be conflicts between both sets of documentation to watch out for.  I do not think this possibility should discourage you from using COMcheck or similar tools to enhance your personal workflow and documentation.  The format by which you choose to document your model should not have any bearing on whether you will need to explain discrepancies with other documentation.

When others are assembling COMcheck reports (or other compliance documentation), as the energy modeler I will make a point to review our inputs against each other for corrections, as there shouldn't be two sets of documentation floating out there with conflicting results.  I take on QC measures like this to avoid such review commentary altogether.  In a positive light, making such checks is an easy way to QC your model inputs against the actual design, and may even reveal design decisions which haven't been realized in the model.

Hope this helps!

~Nick

Hi folks,

Just a quick note to let you all know that the Radiance installers have been updated, and are available for download at the NREL OpenStudio site. These packages include the brand new 'gendaymtx' utility that greatly speeds up the annual calculation when using the daylight coefficient tools in Radiance.

We hope to add gendaymtx into the OpenStudio tool chain and workflow in the coming weeks, but in the meantime, I'm sure Greg would appreciate any feedback from users willing to try it out on their own, especially those Windows users out there. There's a man page explaining its use, and it's pretty straightforward.

Grab yours here:

Hi German,

Yes, gendaymtx is in the HEAD, the installers in the NREL site are based on the HEAD as of Thursday of last week, I believe. And no, the GPU dctimestep is not needed for this to work (nor is that version of dctimestep in HEAD). Nope, gendaymtx works with all the standard Radiance tools. You simply need a weather file formatted the way it wants, which is the same format as a DAYSIM weather file. Andy McNeil notes that DAYSIM has a tool to convert the EnergyPlus weather file format (.epw) to the DAYSIM format. OpenStudio will be modified to automatically provide gendaymtx with the epw data in the format it expects. I noticed that gendaymtx also accepts weather data from STDIN, and that there is an option to feed it less than a full year (8760) of data. We will leverage this ability in OpenStudio for sure, as well.

Exciting times!

- Rob

The vertical sections of the examples include (1) ground-lobby, (2) retail, (3) financial, (4) general-office, (5) hotel services, (6) hotel rooms, (7) apartments, (8) dining-miscellaneous. 
 
The sections are not identical.
Each section used different floor plans & envelope types.
Different envelope types were selected from the CONTAM library for each section. 
The envelope properties are from NIST?s CONTAM library.
5a - CONTAM-Library - Enclosure Leakage Areas (Infiltr-Flow at Press-Temp)
5a is an Excel program that converts the CONTAM leakage areas into infiltration flows at different indoor-outdoor pressure & temperature differences in SI and IP units.
5b - CONTAM-Library - from NIST - Enclosure-Leakage-Areas
5b is the original leakage areas in the CONTAM library.
 
To do this for 8760 hours in an energy program would require excessive execution relative to the significance infiltration energy compared to total energy which is about 1% in summer and 12% in winter for a cold climate like Minneapolis. 
 
Program description is shown in:
3a - Tall-Bldg - Stack-Effect-Infltr ? Excel-Program - User Guide - Report
3b - Infiltration in Tall Buildings - DOE21E & eQUEST Analysis
3c - Figures - Excel Program User Guide - Infiltr in Tall-Bldgs
 
The Excel program uses pressure, temperature & humidity conditions indoors & outdoors but does not take into account wind velocity and direction and therefore exposure orientations. Outdoor temperature is calculated for altitudes based on the ground design weather for summer & winter. 
 
It shows how to obtain ? (To-Ti), ? (Wo-Wi) and ? (Ho-Hi) from 8760 weather file
This method of ? (To-Ti), ? (Wo-Wi) and ? (Ho-Hi) from 8760 weather file is equivalent to 8760 hour calculation of energy programs as shown in:
4a - The ? method is equivalent to 8760 hour calculations of energy programs
 
The energy estimate of infiltration is based on:
DESIGN DATASUMMERWINTER
Indoor DB (F) = Ti7572
Indoor RH %) = RHi5035
?(To:Ti) for 8760-hrs7,654250,474
?(Wo:Wi) for 8760-hrs7.7316.81
? (Ho:Hi) for 8760-hrs8,81775,425

Indoor humidity ratio Wi (lbs/lb) and enthalpy Hi (btu/lb) is calculated from the dry bulb temperature (Ti) and relative humidity (RHi)
 
The difference between indoor and outdoor Temperature (To-Ti), Humidity Ratio (Wo-Wi) and Enthalpy (Ho-Hi) for summer & winter conditions for 8760 hours is required for the Tall-Bldg-Infiltr Excel program. 
 
Instructions for obtaining these values are under ?C1c ?Excel Weather-Analysis of Converted DOE2.bin file?.  Go to website http://bepan.info/  and then http://bepan.info/weather    and open or download:

The program requires converting DOE2 8760-hour ?Weather.bin? binary file to a ?Weather.ft? text file using the DOE2 weather processor, and then converting the text file to an Excel file ?Weather.xlsx?.  Go to website http://bepan.info/  and then http://bepan.info/weather

(3) For different types envelopes (selected from the CONTAM library) the infiltration per envelope area is between: 
0.02 and 0.09 cfm per sqft of envelope area in summer 
0.04 and 0.16 cfm per sqft of envelope area in winter 
using stack effect & varying the outdoor conditions due to elevation
(4) The infiltration cost ($)/year is: 
$138,065 ($0.21/sf Envelop-Area) for the 82 floor-bldg and 
$809,768 (($0.48/sf Envelope-Area) for the 177 floor-bldg. 
It is based on $0.15 per kwh for electricity and $0.75 per therm for natural gas.
(5) eQUEST default is 0.038 cfm per sqft summer and winter for all envelope types.
 
The envelope properties are from NIST?s CONTAM library.
5a - CONTAM-Library - Enclosure Leakage Areas (Infiltr-Flow at Press-Temp)
 
Below are some of my views:
Modern tall bldgs envelopes are steel-frame and glass (very light).
The envelope panels are manufactured off-site to exact dimensions using numerical control machines that allow for glass & frame expansion & contraction for the site location.
Also the requirement for entrance vestibules with a revolving door on the outside minimizes the stack effect infiltration in tall bldgs
There is less leakage in these bldgs compared older bldgs such as the 102 Empire State Bldg in New York built in 1930.
 
For air-conditioned pressurized bldg, the infiltration in summer can be neglected compared to the internal & other external loads.
I think stack-effect infiltration-exfiltration applies only to very tall bldgs.
For all other bldgs is no need to go to all this trouble.
Infiltration is greatest during cold weather when the air outside is denser than the dry air inside.
 
Wind velocity and direction also makes a difference. 
There is infiltration in a pressurized bldg even in cold weather.
Infiltration air enters from the windward side and exits from the leeward side (exfiltration)??
In summer the colder air inside is denser than the hotter air outside.
Infiltration is still a factor in pressurized bldgs even in summer.
 
There other specific issues that can be analyzed independently of 8760 hour energy programs.  Go to website http://bepan.info/  and then tab ?Engg-Calcs?  http://bepan.info/engg-calcs to review some Excel programs that were created to study problems associated with particular projects such as.

1 - BEPAR OBJECTIVES (draft for review at IIT-meeting 11-4-11
2 - BEPAR Proposed Database Organization & Forms to Submit Case Studies
BEPAN - OBJECTIVES:
(1) Develop case studies for different types of buildings with energy conservation options using different energy analysis programs. A statistical database of building performance by building types can be useful to A-E firms as a reference guide in the design of, and for projecting the performance of new buildings.
(2) Develop case studies of campuses and townships. Campuses & townships can save energy by using cogeneration plant for power and HVAC. Example: Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) comparing the present IIT campus Mechanical-Electrical Systems with a proposed central system that includes a Cogeneration plant for power and HVAC - http://www.iit.edu/about/campus_map.shtml
(3) Develop courses and graduate programs in energy efficient building design and would emphasize design practice using case studies. The two year graduate programs can be taught part-time by adjunct faculty working full-time at A-E firms if the basic teaching notes are developed by the group.
(4) Develop research topics by Academia in A-E design submitted by A-E design firms. A-E design firms cannot justify the overhead cost of Research & Development but a Group representing A-E design firms can accomplish this with the support of academic research institutions.

Hi Sheelam,

probably this is not possible without tweaking. As far as I am aware,
Design Builder uses the standard backwards algorithm of Radiance. That
one is not really made for typical solar tubes, if you want to consider
direct sun and you have no diffuser on top of the tube. If you would run
your Radiance simulations directly, you could either use a sky where the
direct sun contribution would be spread over a wider solid angle (see
Tregenza's sky subdivision scheme) or apply extensions such as the
Photon Map. I doubt that these are available in Design Builder (though I
do not really know this for sure). If you need a front end, you can have
a look at Daysim, which includes the Photon Map and also supports the
daylight coefficient method using Tregenza and higher resolution sky models.

I would recommend a look at the Radiance workshop presentation of the
recent years, which are all available at www.radiance-online.org.

Cheers, Lars.

I know nothing much about DesignBuilder, but if it uses Radiance for the daylighting calculations, the best way to accurately model a tubular daylight device is to obtain the photometric distribution file AKA ".ies file" for the make and size of TDD you are modeling. They are all somewhat of a hack, since they attempt to characterize the distribution and intensity of a thing that redirects an infinitely variable light source, using a single file. But there are ways to scale the intensity, and even to account for exterior obstructions at the roof aperture, by doing some evaluations of the global exterior illuminance and comparing it to the assumption that the photo metric file made, and scaling accordingly.

In any event, this is really the best way to characterize a TDD in Radiance, because you are treating the luminous aperture as a direct light source, rather than attempting to use Radiance's indirect calculation to hope enough random rays find their way up the TDD and out to the hemisphere and actually intercept the sun and other major contributors (like big puffy cumulus clouds), which is unlikely at best.

Because the California Energy Commission has a thorough and some would say onerous certification procedure requiring the software vender to do a suite of 160 certification test runs to demonstrate that their software produces results that are consistent with the Commission's results.  All this is spelled out in Chapter 5 (if my memory is correct) of the Commission's 350+ page ACM (Alternate Compliance Method) manual. How this will change in the future is not clear since the Commission has embarked in 2007 on a new procedure where they would take charge of the entire compliance calculation procedure, instead of specifying the rules.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan Power
Message-ID: <51279BE0.4090007@wichert.org>

This is a DOE-2 question, I think, but I am applying it to EnergyPro.  I 
am asking here in the hopes that some will have a more in-depth 
knowledge of DOE-2 and how it relates to fan power.  I am also hoping 
that some here will be able to reflect on the theory and application of 
fan power and energy as it relates to actual systems and modeling.

When inputting indoor fan power, I have used many sources for the fan 
power.  I sometimes use the motor nameplate, which I believe is too high 
in every case.

I also sometimes use FLA or RLA, which I also do not believe are 
accurate, but sometimes give more realistic numbers.

Some manufacturers give fan BHP at design conditions, which I find to be 
very helpful, but not everybody is that helpful.

It has been suggested that I calculate the fan BHP using the theoretical 
formula *** Fan BHP = (cfm x static press "w.c.) / (6356 x fan 
efficiency) *** and then use a conservative fan efficiency (maybe 50%) 
for a good number.  This gives a much lower value than the other 
methods, and I am trying to see if there is anything wrong with this 
approach.

As I understand the usage, indoor fan power is divided by motor and 
drive efficiency to come up with fan energy.  So the fan BHP is the 
starting point.  Having this too high drives up fan energy, sometimes 
dramatically, and can influence the proposed case quite a bit if there 
are lots of fans, even small fans.


Any thoughts on this approach would be very much appreciated.

Robert,

 

I've also run into problems obtaining combined (fan and motor) efficiency
and input power, mostly with terminal units such as heat pumps and fan coil
units but also with individual fans.  What I've often done is used the watts
listed in their electrical tables.  For example, below if you take their
size 20 at high fan speed, they classify the motor HP at 1/30HP or 25W
(output power).  I've taken the subsequent columns to mean input power so
the watts at 115V is then 57W which would make the motor is 44% efficient
and that seems reasonable to me.  The listed amps don't necessarily equate
to the same wattages, they are usually higher so my only theory is that this
is the starting amps.  

 

I'd be interested in finding out what other have to say.  I have tried
talking to some local equipment reps without any luck.

 

Aaron

We are considering applying this technology in a NZEB renovation (
www.zehr.be), but most available models are oversized. The smallest has a
nominal output of 10kW, and can modulate down to around 3kW. We will use it
in winter to heat and produce sanitary hot water when the solar thermal
system does not produce enough.

Thermal buffering can be done in the buidling structure (floor heating) and
with a tank.

Estimated peak heating load is around 4 to 5 kW for house heating, normal 4
person family demand for sanitary hot water.

Thanks for any suggestions!

A 50% efficient MOTOR cannot be correct.   50% efficient fan, yes.  

I actually think a lot of the amps given are something akin to MCA.

Based on Aaron?s calculations, it sounds like 44% = motor efficiency x fan efficiency,  That?s the net which affects energy use ? how it is composed doesn?t matter too much.
Small motors often have terrible efficiency.  The same is true for small fans!  Put them together and it?s pretty dismal.

This is a DOE-2 question, I think, but I am applying it to EnergyPro.  I

am asking here in the hopes that some will have a more in-depth

knowledge of DOE-2 and how it relates to fan power.  I am also hoping

that some here will be able to reflect on the theory and application of

fan power and energy as it relates to actual systems and modeling.



When inputting indoor fan power, I have used many sources for the fan

power.  I sometimes use the motor nameplate, which I believe is too high

in every case.



I also sometimes use FLA or RLA, which I also do not believe are

accurate, but sometimes give more realistic numbers.



Some manufacturers give fan BHP at design conditions, which I find to be

very helpful, but not everybody is that helpful.



It has been suggested that I calculate the fan BHP using the theoretical

formula *** Fan BHP = (cfm x static press "w.c.) / (6356 x fan

efficiency) *** and then use a conservative fan efficiency (maybe 50%)

for a good number.  This gives a much lower value than the other

methods, and I am trying to see if there is anything wrong with this

approach.



As I understand the usage, indoor fan power is divided by motor and

drive efficiency to come up with fan energy.  So the fan BHP is the

starting point.  Having this too high drives up fan energy, sometimes

dramatically, and can influence the proposed case quite a bit if there

are lots of fans, even small fans.





Any thoughts on this approach would be very much appreciated.

Small FHP HVAC motors can have efficiencies below 50% which is why ECM motors are becomming popular in that size range - they are typically 65-85% efficient.  See in the presentation below where w/cfm is 1/3 with ECM vs PSC.

The data is very hard to come by, but 44% for the motor only I believe is about right in those smaller motors.  35% wouldn't surprise me with maybe a 60-65% direct drive blower so 20% wire-air wouldn't be out of the ballpark in my opinion.  The motors are historically single phase split capacitor historically and a poorer quality than a small 3 phase induction motor.   

On a tangent, 3 phase induction motor efficiencies really drop off below 1.5 HP or so.  Unless of a very high quality / HE then the part load efficiency can also be very poor despite the full load efficiency looking OK.  So a small 3 phase motor could have 85% full load / full speed efficiency but at 25% load (say 50% speed and 50% torque) the efficiency can be dramatically poorer.  We have managed to get part load motor efficiency data from TECO and others in the past that go down to 50% torque but at full speed (thus 50% load) so not that helpful as variable speed / variable pressure systems spend time at much lower loads.  The data does typically show a peak efficiency at 75% load however where I2R losses have dropped but eddy current and other losses haven't started to dominate the losses and thus drive efficiency down which they do at lower loads. 

We have a large project where we have asked contractors and thus suppliers to test select equipment on their test rigs to generate better part load data.  We will see how we go.

Fortunately with a lot of smaller equipment digital motors or electrically commutated motors have lifted efficiencies dramatically as they are direct drive and being digital the variable speed controls are intrinsic to the motor.

Getting part load efficiencies out of VSD drive suppliers we have found to be like drawing blood out of a stone.  I assume that there is a large fixed component of losses so at part load in % terms the VSD losses could grow from 3% say to 7-10%. Don't forget your belts as well if you are taking a fan manufacturer's bhp figures as they typically do not include the belts - maybe 3-5% in losses if well aligned and tensioned.

If you have variable flow, variable pressure systems that spend a lot of time at very low loads, the VSD can affect the motor efficiency at lower loads.  There was an ASHRAE Transactions paper or RP from the late 90's I recall that showed motor part load efficiency without a VSD drive and then with and there was a difference.  If I remember correctly they did the test with a SE motor but may have also done with a HE motor and the HE motors are more resilient to the impacts of a VSD.

I guess all I am trying to say is that getting a full load design point is one thing, but make sure it includes all the losses and more importantly make sure you take a view on what happens at part load as that is where larger modern systems operate.  Smaller systems may be constant flow / constant speed but increasingly we are seeing variable speed FCUs etc available on the market using ECMs.

Graham

Well, OK, I will bow to your expertise, but a 44% motor sounds pretty 
dismal to me, as you suggest.

Would a conservative number be 20%, air to wire?  Is so, I am looking 
for FAN efficiency.  NOT motor or drive efficiency, which are taken care 
of by the modeling software separately.

Would 50% for FAN efficiency by reasonable?

If so, this allows me to use the theoretical air BHP equation to 
calculate fan BHP at design conditions using 50% fan efficiency. This 
would be a big breakthrough for me, actually.

I do like the idea of actual testing, which is rare as hen's teeth.  
Even amp numbers are way too high.  I have had RLA that show more HP 
than the nominal motor HP.  That's gotta be wrong.

I have not seen a single ECM fan coil unit with an improved fan BHP.  
Not one.  If you got one, please share your knowledge!

Why don't you see if you can get fan curves for some small fans - they'll show fan efficiency.
p.s., I think 50% for the fan is darn good for most rooftop equipment; anything smaller will almost certainly be worse.  I did some modeling for a manufacturer a while back who used ~2,000 cfm backward inclined fans - 40% static efficiency

Well, OK, I will bow to your expertise, but a 44% motor sounds pretty dismal to me, as you suggest.

Would a conservative number be 20%, air to wire?  Is so, I am looking for FAN efficiency.  NOT motor or drive efficiency, which are taken care of by the modeling software separately.

Would 50% for FAN efficiency by reasonable?

If so, this allows me to use the theoretical air BHP equation to calculate fan BHP at design conditions using 50% fan efficiency.  This would be a big breakthrough for me, actually.

I do like the idea of actual testing, which is rare as hen's teeth.  Even amp numbers are way too high.  I have had RLA that show more HP than the nominal motor HP.  That's gotta be wrong.

The motors are historically single phase split capacitor historically and a poorer quality than a small 3 phase induction motor.

On a tangent, 3 phase induction motor efficiencies really drop off below 1.5 HP or so.  Unless of a very high quality / HE then the part load efficiency can also be very poor despite the full load efficiency looking OK.  So a small 3 phase motor could have 85% full load / full speed efficiency but at 25% load (say 50% speed and 50% torque) the efficiency can be dramatically poorer.  We have managed to get part load motor efficiency data from TECO and others in the past that go down to 50% torque but at full speed (thus 50% load) so not that helpful as variable speed / variable pressure systems spend time at much lower loads.  The data does typically show a peak efficiency at 75% load however where I2R losses have dropped but eddy current and other losses haven't started to dominate the losses and thus drive efficiency down which they do at lower loads.

We have a large project where we have asked contractors and thus suppliers to test select equipment on their test rigs to generate better part load data.  We will see how we go.

Fortunately with a lot of smaller equipment digital motors or electrically commutated motors have lifted efficiencies dramatically as they are direct drive and being digital the variable speed controls are intrinsic to the motor.

Getting part load efficiencies out of VSD drive suppliers we have found to be like drawing blood out of a stone.  I assume that there is a large fixed component of losses so at part load in % terms the VSD losses could grow from 3% say to 7-10%. Don't forget your belts as well if you are taking a fan manufacturer's bhp figures as they typically do not include the belts - maybe 3-5% in losses if well aligned and tensioned.

If you have variable flow, variable pressure systems that spend a lot of time at very low loads, the VSD can affect the motor efficiency at lower loads.  There was an ASHRAE Transactions paper or RP from the late 90's I recall that showed motor part load efficiency without a VSD drive and then with and there was a difference.

I guess all I am trying to say is that getting a full load design point is one thing, but make sure it includes all the losses and more importantly make sure you take a view on what happens at part load as that is where larger modern systems operate.  Smaller systems may be constant flow / constant speed but increasingly we are seeing variable speed FCUs etc available on the market using ECMs.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan Power

This is a DOE-2 question, I think, but I am applying it to EnergyPro.  I
am asking here in the hopes that some will have a more in-depth
knowledge of DOE-2 and how it relates to fan power.  I am also hoping
that some here will be able to reflect on the theory and application of
fan power and energy as it relates to actual systems and modeling.

When inputting indoor fan power, I have used many sources for the fan
power.  I sometimes use the motor nameplate, which I believe is too high
in every case.

I also sometimes use FLA or RLA, which I also do not believe are
accurate, but sometimes give more realistic numbers.

Some manufacturers give fan BHP at design conditions, which I find to be
very helpful, but not everybody is that helpful.

It has been suggested that I calculate the fan BHP using the theoretical
formula *** Fan BHP = (cfm x static press "w.c.) / (6356 x fan
efficiency) *** and then use a conservative fan efficiency (maybe 50%)
for a good number.  This gives a much lower value than the other
methods, and I am trying to see if there is anything wrong with this
approach.

As I understand the usage, indoor fan power is divided by motor and
drive efficiency to come up with fan energy.  So the fan BHP is the
starting point.  Having this too high drives up fan energy, sometimes
dramatically, and can influence the proposed case quite a bit if there
are lots of fans, even small fans.


Any thoughts on this approach would be very much appreciated.

Yes, good ideas, Jim, but I am disappointed in your 2,000 CFM fan with 
40% static efficiency. That's scary.

We use Aspen fan coils, and I don't know if they have fan curves. I'll 
ask.  They are most likely smaller though, so even more scary.

Robert,
It's a major fan manufacturer!  I'm not too surprised (just a little).  These happen to use ECM and the variable speed feature covers a lot of "sins", but you are right - a bit scary.

Yes, good ideas, Jim, but I am disappointed in your 2,000 CFM fan with 40% static efficiency.  That's scary.

We use Aspen fan coils, and I don't know if they have fan curves.  I'll ask.  They are most likely smaller though, so even more scary.

p.s., I think 50% for the fan is darn good for most rooftop equipment; anything smaller will almost certainly be worse.  I did some modeling for a manufacturer a while back who used ~2,000 cfm backward inclined fans - 40% static efficiency

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Fan Power

Well, OK, I will bow to your expertise, but a 44% motor sounds pretty dismal to me, as you suggest.

Would a conservative number be 20%, air to wire?  Is so, I am looking for FAN efficiency.  NOT motor or drive efficiency, which are taken care of by the modeling software separately.

Would 50% for FAN efficiency by reasonable?

If so, this allows me to use the theoretical air BHP equation to calculate fan BHP at design conditions using 50% fan efficiency.  This would be a big breakthrough for me, actually.

I do like the idea of actual testing, which is rare as hen's teeth.  Even amp numbers are way too high.  I have had RLA that show more HP than the nominal motor HP.  That's gotta be wrong.

I have not seen a single ECM fan coil unit with an improved fan BHP.  Not one.  If you got one, please share your knowledge!


Cheers from sunny California.

The data is very hard to come by, but 44% for the motor only I believe is about right in those smaller motors.  35% wouldn't surprise me with maybe a 60-65% direct drive blower so 20% wire-air wouldn't be out of the ballpark in my opinion.  The motors are historically single phase split capacitor historically and a poorer quality than a small 3 phase induction motor.

On a tangent, 3 phase induction motor efficiencies really drop off below 1.5 HP or so.  Unless of a very high quality / HE then the part load efficiency can also be very poor despite the full load efficiency looking OK.  So a small 3 phase motor could have 85% full load / full speed efficiency but at 25% load (say 50% speed and 50% torque) the efficiency can be dramatically poorer.  We have managed to get part load motor efficiency data from TECO and others in the past that go down to 50% torque but at full speed (thus 50% load) so not that helpful as variable speed / variable pressure systems spend time at much lower loads.  The data does typically show a peak efficiency at 75% load however where I2R losses have dropped but eddy current and other losses haven't started to dominate the losses and thus drive efficiency down which they do at lower loads.

We have a large project where we have asked contractors and thus suppliers to test select equipment on their test rigs to generate better part load data.  We will see how we go.

Fortunately with a lot of smaller equipment digital motors or electrically commutated motors have lifted efficiencies dramatically as they are direct drive and being digital the variable speed controls are intrinsic to the motor.

Getting part load efficiencies out of VSD drive suppliers we have found to be like drawing blood out of a stone.  I assume that there is a large fixed component of losses so at part load in % terms the VSD losses could grow from 3% say to 7-10%. Don't forget your belts as well if you are taking a fan manufacturer's bhp figures as they typically do not include the belts - maybe 3-5% in losses if well aligned and tensioned.

If you have variable flow, variable pressure systems that spend a lot of time at very low loads, the VSD can affect the motor efficiency at lower loads.  There was an ASHRAE Transactions paper or RP from the late 90's I recall that showed motor part load efficiency without a VSD drive and then with and there was a difference.  If I remember correctly they did the test with a SE motor but may have also done with a HE motor and the HE motors are more resilient to the impacts of a VSD.

I guess all I am trying to say is that getting a full load design point is one thing, but make sure it includes all the losses and more importantly make sure you take a view on what happens at part load as that is where larger modern systems operate.  Smaller systems may be constant flow / constant speed but increasingly we are seeing variable speed FCUs etc available on the market using ECMs.

Graham

Small motors often have terrible efficiency.  The same is true for small fans!  Put them together and it's pretty dismal.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan Power

This is a DOE-2 question, I think, but I am applying it to EnergyPro.  I
am asking here in the hopes that some will have a more in-depth
knowledge of DOE-2 and how it relates to fan power.  I am also hoping
that some here will be able to reflect on the theory and application of
fan power and energy as it relates to actual systems and modeling.

When inputting indoor fan power, I have used many sources for the fan
power.  I sometimes use the motor nameplate, which I believe is too high
in every case.

I also sometimes use FLA or RLA, which I also do not believe are
accurate, but sometimes give more realistic numbers.

Some manufacturers give fan BHP at design conditions, which I find to be
very helpful, but not everybody is that helpful.

It has been suggested that I calculate the fan BHP using the theoretical
formula *** Fan BHP = (cfm x static press "w.c.) / (6356 x fan
efficiency) *** and then use a conservative fan efficiency (maybe 50%)
for a good number.  This gives a much lower value than the other
methods, and I am trying to see if there is anything wrong with this
approach.

As I understand the usage, indoor fan power is divided by motor and
drive efficiency to come up with fan energy.  So the fan BHP is the
starting point.  Having this too high drives up fan energy, sometimes
dramatically, and can influence the proposed case quite a bit if there
are lots of fans, even small fans.


Any thoughts on this approach would be very much appreciated.

*Title:** *EnergyPlus for Early Design and Single Zone Studies; David
Fannon AIA, Senior Associate, Senior High Performance Specialist, Syska
Hennessy Group, Inc.****

** **

*Description:** *This talk focuses on using COMFEN to run simplified
EnergyPlus models which inform early design-decisions and perform simple
single-zone studies quickly and relatively inexpensively.  Using examples
from recent projects, we will discuss ways to use COMFEN both an interface
for rapid simulation and as a ready-made database that can be manipulated
outside the GUI for comparative studies.  The presentation concludes with
some notes on analyzing the results, the limitations of the tool and
Quality Assurance processes.****

** **

*About the Speaker:** *David is a New York- based member of Syska
Hennessy's High Performance Solutions team, with broad perspective and
experience as a designer, building science researcher and teacher.  His
expertise lies in integrating research, analysis, and design to provide
luminous, thermal and acoustic comfort while reducing resource consumption
in buildings. In the summer of 2011 David traveled to Japan as part of the
Architecture.Energy.2011 workshop to assist architects rebuilding after the
natural and nuclear disasters. He spent two years as a student and
researcher in the Center for the Built Environment at the University of
California Berkeley, and is currently completing his degree. David holds a
Bachelor of Architecture degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and
is a registered architect in the State of New York.****



*Presentation 2*

** **

*Title: *N++: A demonstration of the latest GUI for EnergyPlus; Vladimir
Bajic ? Senior Energy Engineer and Software Developer ****

*
*

*Description: *N++ is a building energy modeling software created to
emulate the architectural and engineering design process. As a front
interface for the highly capable EnergyPlus simulation engine, N++ allows
the user to input project information into the energy simulation in an
intuitive, highly visible fashion that simplifies the energy modeling
process for designers who are new to energy analysis. During the
presentation Mr. Bajic will demonstrate the construction of an energy model
in N++, exemplifying the innovative features that simplify the construction
of complex building geometries, lighting designs and mechanical systems.
The presentation will also demonstrate the flexible capability of N++ to
build multiple parametric runs and produce an energy code baseline quickly
and easily.****

*
*

*About the Speaker**: *Mr. Bajic is a mechanical engineer with over 16
years of experience in the HVAC industry as a designer, energy modeler and
software developer. His experience is both international and domestic.
Mr.Bajic?s main focus is building software applications that will help
architects and engineers design more efficient buildings as part of an
integrated design process. Mr. Bajic is currently a senior energy engineer
at Viridian Energy & Environmental (a Vidaris company). He is also the
founder of the ExpertApp (www.expertapp.com), a software company that is
specialized in creating engineering and architectural cad-based

Presentation 1

Title: EnergyPlus for Early Design and Single Zone Studies; David Fannon  
AIA, Senior Associate, Senior High Performance Specialist, Syska Hennessy  
Group, Inc.

Description: This talk focuses on using COMFEN to run simplified EnergyPlus  
models which inform early design-decisions and perform simple single-zone  
studies quickly and relatively inexpensively.  Using examples from recent  
projects, we will discuss ways to use COMFEN both an interface for rapid  
simulation and as a ready-made database that can be manipulated outside the  
GUI for comparative studies.  The presentation concludes with some notes on  
analyzing the results, the limitations of the tool and Quality Assurance  
processes.

About the Speaker: David is a New York- based member of Syska Hennessy's  
High Performance Solutions team, with broad perspective and experience as a  
designer, building science researcher and teacher.  His expertise lies in  
integrating research, analysis, and design to provide luminous, thermal and  
acoustic comfort while reducing resource consumption in buildings. In the  
summer of 2011 David traveled to Japan as part of the  
Architecture.Energy.2011 workshop to assist architects rebuilding after the  
natural and nuclear disasters. He spent two years as a student and  
researcher in the Center for the Built Environment at the University of  
California Berkeley, and is currently completing his degree. David holds a  
Bachelor of Architecture degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and  
is a registered architect in the State of New York.


Presentation 2

Title: N++: A demonstration of the latest GUI for EnergyPlus; Vladimir  
Bajic ? Senior Energy Engineer and Software Developer

Description: N++ is a building energy modeling software created to emulate  
the architectural and engineering design process. As a front interface for  
the highly capable EnergyPlus simulation engine, N++ allows the user to  
input project information into the energy simulation in an intuitive,  
highly visible fashion that simplifies the energy modeling process for  
designers who are new to energy analysis. During the presentation Mr. Bajic  
will demonstrate the construction of an energy model in N++, exemplifying  
the innovative features that simplify the construction of complex building  
geometries, lighting designs and mechanical systems. The presentation will  
also demonstrate the flexible capability of N++ to build multiple  
parametric runs and produce an energy code baseline quickly and easily.

About the Speaker: Mr. Bajic is a mechanical engineer with over 16 years of  
experience in the HVAC industry as a designer, energy modeler and software  
developer. His experience is both international and domestic. Mr.Bajic?s  
main focus is building software applications that will help architects and  
engineers design more efficient buildings as part of an integrated design  
process. Mr. Bajic is currently a senior energy engineer at Viridian Energy  
& Environmental (a Vidaris company). He is also the founder of the  
ExpertApp (www.expertapp.com), a software company that is specialized in  
creating engineering and architectural cad-based applications focused on  
integrated sustainable design.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] non-refrigerated warehouse roof insulation R-value
Message-ID: <CAJaiD7oTTdn8RipQ=zGrp9tsiAiXNeOH4cFJ4fT-NYje+VD-nQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Are there any existing studies that investigate the relationship between
the roof insulation R-value and energy performance in a non-refrigerated
warehouse/distribution center?

The ASHRAE 90.1 prescriptive baseline is R-20 c.i. and I'm inclined to
believe it is not an envelope dominated building type. In a one story
warehouse that is more than half a million square feet in area, the roof
area can be considerable compared to walls and windows, while the indoor
temperature might be allowed to swing a little more than in other
commercial building types.

Thank you,
Ramana Koti.

Dear Sirs

I made a simulation of two one floor building for offices.
The results indicate the following:
Area / Sypply / Design Capacity
2810 sqft / 3974 cfm / 271cfm/ton
1017 swft / 1306 cfm / 302cfm/ton

Why the software gives these results so differente from the usual rule 
of thumb 400cfm/ton?

Thank you very much.

Khristiam,

I don't know the exact situation of your building, but here are some things
to consider:  

The CFM supplied to a space is driven by the sensible loads in the space.
The coil capacity, however, is driven by the sensible loads in the space,
the latent loads in the space (moisture from people breathing, for example),
the additional sensible loads on the coil (a fan, for example), and the
additional latent loads on the coil (outdoor air, for example).  

If the only loads on your system were sensible space loads, your CFM/ton
would always be about 545 cfm, based on the sensible heat equation
(generally BTU/hr = 1.1*CFM*(deltaT), assuming the temperature difference
between your room air and your supply air is about 20F.  As you add latent
loads and coil loads, the capacity increases while the CFM remains the same.
As a rule it often comes out to around 400 CFM/ton as you say.  But if you
have a high percentage of latent loads or high coil loads, the capacity will
increase more and the CFM/ton will go down further.  Additionally, if you
have a high deltaT between supply air and room air, you will require lower
CFM to meet the load, and your CFM/ton will again go down.

To summarize, the things I can think of that will give you low CFM/tons are:
--High percentage of latent loads
--High percentage of coil loads
--Lower than normal cooling supply air temperature
--Higher than normal room setpoint temperature

I hope this helps,
Christian

Brendan,
I suppose there is a trade off between the options of all buildings in one
file and individual models.
The all buildings in one file option treats other buildings as shading
objects in E+ and as wind shields & shading in design builder, but does not
allow for the use of zone multipliers.

The individual model option allows for zone multipliers and this means
shorter simulation run time.

So I guess it depends on your use; if you want fast run time, single models
are best but if you want to model the geographical features more accurately
than multi model would be best.  If you set the project up in DB, then
export to E+ than the other models will be shading objects, for existing
buildings this is what I like to do.
The logic is that for existing buildings the owners are likely to make
changes to individual zones, so use of zone multipliers may not provide
useful info.

hope this helps and best of regards-

Bldg-simmers -

We are less than a month away from the University of Idaho Integrated
Design Lab's week long EnergyPlus and Radiance Workshop: Modeling Energy
Efficient Buildings.  There are slots still available for the full training
and half day options.  We will be closing registration post February 15th
at 5.00pm MST, and reserve the right to cancel the training on or before
this date due to insufficient enrollment.

This is a great opportunity for beginners just learning how to use
OpenStudio, EnergyPlus, and Radiance for whole building energy and daylight
simulation.  Additionally, intermediate users will gain new, valuable
skills and insights into the workflow used by the University of Idaho
Integrated Design Lab on consulting and research projects.  Everything from
geometry creation, night flush ventilation, daylight rendering/simulation,
and advanced HVAC system definition will be covered!  Advanced users are
welcome to attend the training and hone their existing modeling skill
sets while hopefully learning something new.

The City of Boise is also boasts a pedestrian-friendly urban environment
that is packed full of diverse amenities including: abundant local
restaurants and craft breweries, beautiful desert wilderness adjacent to
the city, and a charming, walkable downtown.

Please email jdunn at uidaho.edu with any inquiries and questions!

Check out the full flyer here:

Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E800FDFA8E5@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues:

In Short


?         We have new DAYSIM version (4.0) plus web site. Check it out at http://daysim.ning.com/.

?         Andy McNeil from LBNL kindly added a new DAYSIM discussion list to Radiance Online at http://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists/archives/radiance-daysim.


For those interested in the details

Apart from offering a download link for the latest DAYSIM version, the new site also offers an interactive API documentation that describe all DAYSIM subprograms and header file keywords<http://daysim.ning.com/page/daysim-header-file>. Focus users of the site are Daysim expert users who want to go beyond the capabilities of the various DAYSIM GUIs (see below) as well as third party GUI developers who want to implement DAYSIM into their programs. The development of the site was supported by the US Department of Energy Energy-Efficiency HUB<http://www.eebhub.org/about-eebhub>. (Thank you to all US tax payers among you.) The current DAYSIM development team includes MIT, the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) and Penn State University (PSU). With the new version come a few  changes and new features.

DAYSIM GUIs
Given the rising number of DAYSIM GUIs, we decided to phase out the old, rather unattractive JAVA GUI that came with the old Daysim and instead rely on third parties to develop plug-ins. In case you are still interested in using the old GUI, you can still  download Daysim 3.1e from the new web site. DAYSIM GUIs that I am aware are listed below. If your GUI is missing or if the table below misrepresents a software, please let me know.

Annual Glare Analysis
Daysim 4.0 includes and improved, more robust version of gen_dgp_profile<http://daysim.ning.com/subprogramgendgpprofile> written by Jan Wienold (ISE). The program calculates annual daylight glare probabilities profiles at selected view points within a scene based on a Radiance scene file, a Radiance View File and an epw weather file.


DYNAMIC SHADING MODULE
With support from SAGE Electrochromic we implemented the capability to model show shading groups independently in Daysim. This allows users to model a variety of rather complicated dynamic facades<http://daysim.ning.com/page/daysim-header-file-keyword-advanced-dynamic-shading>.


Electric Lighting
The shading module can be integrated with various electric lighting controls. Rick Mistrick (PSU) is currently expanding the list of supported controls. PSU is also working on a new DAYSIM program that allows to explicitly model and control electric light sources using IES files. There will also be a module that supports the placement of photo sensors within a scene. We expect these new programs to make their way into DAYSIM later this year.


Happy Daylight Simulations,

Hi All,

 

Does anyone have clarity on modeling OA flow rates in laboratory spaces,
specifically how they relate to the LEED baseline requirement for OA
flow when the proposed model has DCV?  

 

We have a client that wants a specific ACH rate (100% OA, once-thru
system) that is well above the ASHRAE 62.1 OA requirements for
laboratory space in Table 6-1.  We would like to use VAV hoods,
occupancy-based exhaust modulation, etc.  But since this is considered
DCV, is GBCI really going to require us to bring the lab OA volume(flow
reduction) in the proposed system?

 

Thanks for any advice!

DCV, is GBCI really going to require us to bring the lab OA volume(flow

Thanks for any advice!

Hi James,

 

In a recent project we used a combination of CFD, the 62.1 IAQ procedure,
and short-term exposure limits from OHS regulations to verify the ACH rate.
The VRP rates were comparatively low.  For an acetone spill event we arrived
at a figure of 8 ACH.  The baseline, then, would be the same.  We had DCV on
the system, but not for lab spaces where ventilation flow was simply turned
down at night.

Sorry, that last sentence didn't make any sense (thanks Bill).  Should read:

 

We have a client that wants a specific ACH rate (100% OA, once-thru system)
that is well above the ASHRAE 62.1 OA requirements for laboratory space in
Table 6-1.  We would like to use VAV hoods, occupancy-based exhaust
modulation, etc.  But since this is considered DCV, is GBCI really going to
require us to bring the lab OA volume down to ASHRAE 62.1 minimum
requirements for the baseline model?  Or will we be allowed to set the
baseline OA flow for the laboratory at the minimum prescribed rates (say 8
ACH), and take credit for flow reduction in the proposed system?

If you model a reduced OA requirement at night, which is typical and also required in G3.1.1 exception d., the baseline will still have to run at 100% design flow but with a lower OA%, while the proposed model can ramp down to save fan energy.)

Also - when you switch from a standard VAV system to a chilled beam system in a heat gain driven lab there is some reduction. For instance if your EHS mandated ACH is 6ACH, and thermal loads require you to go up to 8ACH to meet the cooling needs, that 8ACH has to be 100% OA (sine you cannot return lab air). A Chilled beam system would allow you to hold the air changes at 6ACH.

Thanks for the replies everyone!

 

I forgot to mention that this is a LEED v4 project, and the verbiage in
90.1-2010 has changed a little bit.

 

With lab exhaust systems > 5,000 CFM (which ours has), you have to
either have a 50% effective heat recovery device, or the ability to
throttle back non-regulated zones to 50% of the exhaust / makeup air
when not used (there i a fancy equation if you want to combine partial
heat recovery and partial flow reduction).  I think you also have the
option to provide direct makeup air that is simply tempered to within a
few degrees of the space setpoint.

 

So I guess this answers the question for me - I'll end up modeling DCV
for both the proposed and baseline (to 50% of peak ACH for baseline, and
whatever we decide for the proposed), along with heat recovery for the
proposed.  I won't have to bring the OA for the baseline all the way
down to ASHRAE 62 values per G3.1.2.11 and 6.5.6.1/6.5.7.2.  The other
option is to model 100% full ACH flow for the baseline system along with
a 50% effective heat recovery device, and see if that is more/less
efficient than the other baseline option.

 

Since G3.1.2.11 in 90.1-2010 now references Section 6, and 6.5.6.1
references 6.5.7.2 which gives multiple options for compliance, it
sounds like there are multiple baseline options for laboratory systems
with exhaust > 5,000 CFM in the new LEED v4.

 

I wonder if GBCI will provide a ruling on this to clarify down the
road...

baseline will still have to run at 100% design flow but with a lower
OA%, while the proposed model can ramp down to save fan energy.)

Sorry, that last sentence didn't make any sense (thanks Bill).  Should
read:

 

We have a client that wants a specific ACH rate (100% OA, once-thru
system) that is well above the ASHRAE 62.1 OA requirements for
laboratory space in Table 6-1.  We would like to use VAV hoods,
occupancy-based exhaust modulation, etc.  But since this is considered
DCV, is GBCI really going to require us to bring the lab OA volume down
to ASHRAE 62.1 minimum requirements for the baseline model?  Or will we
be allowed to set the baseline OA flow for the laboratory at the minimum
prescribed rates (say 8 ACH), and take credit for flow reduction in the
proposed system?

Hi All,

 

Does anyone have clarity on modeling OA flow rates in laboratory spaces,
specifically how they relate to the LEED baseline requirement for OA
flow when the proposed model has DCV?  

 

We have a client that wants a specific ACH rate (100% OA, once-thru
system) that is well above the ASHRAE 62.1 OA requirements for
laboratory space in Table 6-1.  We would like to use VAV hoods,
occupancy-based exhaust modulation, etc.  But since this is considered
DCV, is GBCI really going to require us to bring the lab OA volume(flow
reduction) in the proposed system?

 

Thanks for any advice!

Dear colleagues,

I vaguely recall past discussions on this forum as to the penetration rate on building energy modeling in new construction (and retrofit?). Would some of you have relevant numbers for the US and other countries to share.

I think you need to define "automatically" carefully.
DesignBuilder does a fair amount of the work and Simergy intends to do something similar.
As an example, the proper ASHRAE 90.1 EER / COP is not known until you actually run the simulation and find out the capacity.  It seems to me that some of the criteria must be ascertained from a successful simulation before you can have a complete Baseline.
Another example that has been discussed in this forum  is calculating the proper fan and pump pressure rise to comply with 90.1

That is a good point Jim. To actually generate a baseline following either of the protocols, it is necessary to first do a sizing run. So the automation would need to be a two-step process.

If you have waterside systems it really becomes three steps:

1)      Run with all guesses to determine airside sizing

2)      Run with determined airside sizing and guessed waterside sizing

3)      Run with known airside and waterside sizing

Then the complications of the rotations and satisfying unmet hours criteria.
If you view modeling like a video game with level to achieve and get a good soundtrack, then you can be happily oblivious about how much time you are spending on it.

You do need to be careful about "automatic" - it's a complex thing to fully automate.  There are more exceptions than rules.

IES VE has a PRM Navigator which automates baselines for both 90.1-2004 and 2007 following the PRM methodology (Appendix G).

The PRM Navigator does auto-generate much of the baseline - but also allows the user to go in and see and "break" or edit the baseline as needed for different conditions.

Echoing everyone's caution for "Automatic" - I think it also depends on what you are using it for. If it's for a detailed compliance modeling, then I would really caution against it. If it's for quick EEM explorations I am sure it's a simpler matter.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Automatic Generation of Baseline Models

You do need to be careful about "automatic" - it's a complex thing to fully automate.  There are more exceptions than rules.

IES VE has a PRM Navigator which automates baselines for both 90.1-2004 and 2007 following the PRM methodology (Appendix G).

The PRM Navigator does auto-generate much of the baseline - but also allows the user to go in and see and "break" or edit the baseline as needed for different conditions.

I am hoping the building simulation community can help answer a question for me. What software packages out there automatically generate baseline models for the ASHRAE 90.1 Energy Cost Budget Methodology or Appendix G? Thanks.

What I was really interested in is software that does the whole process automatically. No manipulation on the part of the user at all. You input a proposed building design, and following one of the rulesets results are generated. Does that exist and if it does, for which protocols?

I would say that the LEED plugin for IDA ICE 4.5 does a pretty good job. 
For most buildings you need very little manupilation.

Hi!

Are questions about residential modeling software like rem/rate welcome

Energypro from Energysoft does a 90.1 Appendix G baseline
and comparison with the proposed too and generally is good enough for LEED
reviewer. Not very permeable though, so you need two learn DOE2 to really
understand what you are modelling.

Bldg-simmers -

We are happy to announce that our week-long EnergyPlus and Radiance
Training on Feb 25th will now incorporate a session on using EnergyPlus's
new variable refrigerant flow (VRF) modeling capability.

This is a new feature of EnergyPlus as of version 7.0, which came out at
the end of 2011.  Version 7.2 has expanded the functionality of the system
and included inherent heat recovery and water-cooled condenser options.
 Our lab has had a chance to use this new system on two consulting projects
and was able to incorporate it at the last moment into our training.

We are about a week away from our cutoff date (Feb 15, 5.00 MST), but still
have slots available for the full week or just portions of the workshop.

Please email jdunn at uidaho.edu with any inquiries and questions!

Check out the full flyer here:
http://www.idlboise.com/pdf/uiidl_eplus_radiance_training.pdf

Check out a full description of the workshop, its sessions, and pricing
options here: http://idlboise.com/energyplus-radiance-workshop-2013

I should add that users can chose to create the app g baseline models and modify them if necessary or chose to simply run them at simulation time.

AECOsim Energy Simulator does check the HVAC systems and sizing before creating the models. The HVAC systems are automatically created based on preconfigured HVAC systems. (All done with EnergyPlus v7.2).

I am hoping the building simulation community can help answer a question for me. What software packages out there automatically generate baseline models for the ASHRAE 90.1 Energy Cost Budget Methodology or Appendix G? Thanks.

Thank you for sharing, Dru. I am curious, what process AECOsim uses to
model G3.1.3.5 and G3.1.3.10 requirements for hot- and chilled-water pumps,
as they are not direct inputs,

Hi Attiq,

It's easy to blur how "thermal zoning" should/shouldn't be handled without sufficient context.  Recognize that this term can have slightly different implications/definitions when you are discussing HVAC design, energy modeling, and LEED/90.1 requirements.  Context is critical.

More specifically, there are often multiple right answers to how you can choose to define thermal zones for a given model: rest assured it will be your call to make (and justify) in the end.  I generally start by defining which areas are covered by the different conditioning systems.  Then, if you have multizone systems, divide those floor areas up into zones with respect to the associated system.  One way to think of that is "one zone per thermostat."  These zones may or may not be defined by interior partitions.

Further, if the model's complexity is anticipated to be unwieldy down the road, I'll consider consolidating zones with similar load profiles, occupancy characteristics, & systems (i.e. a series of contiguous private offices along a shared perimeter).  90.1 and the 90.1 User's manual go into more depth in regards to what is considered acceptable.  Also, be mindful of procedural limitations for your energy modeling software/tools of choice when making these zoning simplification decisions - your chosen software may dictate to what extent this even makes sense from a time-efficiency perspective.

Specific to LEED and multi-tenanted buildings, it has been my experience that LEED reviewers will demand the most recent tenant layouts/information at the time of model review be incorporated into the model.  If your present design includes any un-tenanted "shell" space for future tenants, you'd be well advised to plan ahead as you assemble your model for how you might address needing to re-zone parts of the project in the indeterminate future.  Additionally, I have read LEED core & shell includes guidelines for how to address the future loads of such spaces (Equipment, LPD's and so forth), though I believe you can choose to document different figures if there are building performance specs the future tenants are to be held to.
Best of luck!

Hi list members:

 

Anybody knows the definition of Density of Air (DENSTY) in the weather file
for eQUEST/DOE-2? The unit is (LB/CU FT), but I am not sure whether it is
pound of dry air or moisture air. Thanks for any suggestion.

 

Regards

Message-ID: <513FDF89A7D69F45AC14DF0C92C70CD0388E2850@Exchange-oma.meg.local>

Building Simulation Community -

I'm having issues with humidity in some models I'm running while trying to use ApacheHVAC. I have set my "Maximum Percent Saturation" to 50%, and in the VE ASHRAE Loads Results Data tab of the loads data spreadsheet it shows that max input as 50%. If I go into Vista and highlight my "filename.asp" file for the run that is linked to my ApacheHVAC system and run the "Heating and Cooling Report" and look at the "Comfort - Occupied" section all of my rooms have a Max% Relative Humidity of 85-100%. This is the same if I select "Systems" from the drop down and investigate Relative Humidity on a node by node basis at the rooms in my ApacheHVAC system.

Rooms in my model that are not assigned to an ApacheHVAC system and are left with the default ApacheSystems system show that they are being maintained at 50% RH.

All rooms whether assigned to the ApacheHVAC systems or the default systems show that they're letting room temperatures float to Unoccupied setpoints during the "Comfort - Occupied" times.

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated, the buildings I'm trying to work on are located in Louisville, KY and Tampa, FL so not accounting for dehumidification is going to vastly effect the cooling load.

Thanks,

Dear fellow energy modelers,
*
*
*We (myself and more than 100 other modelers) want to make answers more
accessible to the building energy modeling community. There are many venues
(usually forums or mailing lists like this one) where modelers are already
asking questions, but, though these services include an archive of all
previous questions, answers, discussions, and announcements, they lack the
organization and structure to make the knowledge base of answers easily
accessible.*
*
The computer programming community has faced this same problem and has come
up with a solution called stackoverflow.com <http://stackoverflow.com/about>,
a website that focuses entirely on providing answers. The Stack Overflow
platform relies on the community to up-vote good answers to increase the
visibility for others who may ask the same question in the future. When
others vote for your answers you gain "reputation points" that help
establish your expertise in the community, which in turn provides a better
incentive to provide answers even to the most beginner-level questions.

Since launching in 2008, Stack Overflow has been extremely successful:
boasting 17 million unique visitors and 8.3 million answers! The success of
Stack Overflow has led to several other question and answer
sites<http://stackexchange.com/sites>from
photography <http://photo.stackexchange.com/> to
cooking<http://cooking.stackexchange.com/>to Jewish
law <http://judaism.stackexchange.com/>, all using the same platform as
Stack Overflow and successfully supporting their respective communities.

We would like to do the same for the building energy modeling community,
but before we can launch a fully functional site we need your help to prove
that we have a large enough active community to support such a site and to
help establish the scope of support the site will offer. This is the only
requirement to use Stack Oveflow's platform; it is completely free and open

Hi Neal,

I applaud you for this effort, and I just signed in to take part.  However,
the StackOverflow point system is very frustrating.  The site fluctuates
between telling me that I have a reputation of 51, and then a reputation of
1.  I was able to upvote a few questions, but now the site thinks that I
have a reputation of 1, and so I can't take part in the discussion.  I'm
not sure if others have had the same experiences, but I'd be curious to
know.  I know that you are limited to the number of votes you can cast over
the course of a day, but do you loose "reputation" for upvoting other posts?

Karen,

Thanks for bringing this up. There are a few steps that you need to go
through before you can vote:

1. Follow the site<http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/45232/building-performance-simulation-analysis>(this
requires that you enter an email address)

[image: Inline image 3]

2. Confirm your address (an email will automatically be generated and sent
to the address you enter)


3. Register for an account (until you register you will have only 1
reputation point)

[image: Inline image 2]

4. After you register you will be given 50 more points and the privilege to
vote. This also gives you a chance to change your name from the generic
userXXXXX.

It may take a while for the Stack Exchange servers to update and get
everything ready for you to participate. It looks like you now have 51
points and you've used all 5 of your votes. Let me know if you are still
having trouble.

Thanks,

Neal Kruis

Difficult to diagnose from your description but certain zone level system
settings become redundant when you use aphvac.

Are you using the controllers in aphvac to control humidity via coils or
are you expecting aphvac to the "find" settings in your zone "room
conditions"tab?

It's not always obvious what settings become redundant.

I'm using all prototype systems, and they all have humidity controllers attached to the coil/room when imported.  Looking at those controllers they have a setpoint of 50% RH with a 10% deadband.  I don't know if that's standard with the prototype systems or if it's pulling that from my room conditions tab, but either way everything seems to be pointing to 50% RH.

Hi all,

As a follower of multiple lists such as BLDG-SIM, TRNSYS, EnergyPlus, etc.,
I've often been frustrated with email support lists. For one, if you
subscribe late, you miss out on searching the archive of answers, leading
to questions being asked multiple times. Two, many questions spill across
multiple lists, also a redundancy.

I can see a real benefit in using the Stack Exchange model and the
connected potential for building a real online community of building
simulation professionals. The whole concept is based on voting for
questions and answers. Without this participation, the site cannot
function.

With over 100 followers, this concept has momentum. If it is realized, it
will be a fundamental shift in how we all interact. Critically, it will
shift traffic away from the traditional tool Q&A lists, potentially
splitting user communities. This might influence how vendors communicate
with their users. How will you react?

I am an avid supporter of the idea, but we need an educated and community
supported transition, so please learn about this "new" technology, and ask
questions!

The proposal:
http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/45232/building-performance-simulation-analysis

Right now, the proposal in the "definition" phase. What types of questions
define our community?

(Follow & Upvote!)

Please excuse cross postings.

DesignBuilder are offering a 5-day modular training course in central London March 18-22. The course will be an excellent opportunity to find out from the experts how to get the most out of DesignBuilder and learn best practice modelling techniques. Days 1-4 are suitable for less experienced users and the Detailed HVAC Day 5 is suitable for experienced DesignBuilder users as well as attendees of days 1-4. The course is structured to give you plenty of worked examples so you can 'learn by doing'.

Summary of course contents:


*         Day 1, 18th March, Modeller. The aim of the day is to provide trainees with the knowledge required to confidently set up building geometry using blocks, zone up and define and select constructions and glazing.

*         Day 2, 19th March, Basic Simulation. Introduces heating and cooling design, solar, lighting, HVAC and scheduled natural ventilation, data entry and basic simulation.

*         Day 3, 20th March, Calculated Natural Ventilation and CFD. A two part day starting with sessions on EnergyPlus calculated natural ventilation, leading on to an introduction to CFD covering both internal and external CFD including linked EnergyPlus and CFD simulations

*         Day 4, 21st March, Daylighting & Introduction to Detailed HVAC. A two part day, starting with use of Radiance Daylighting for design and LEED/BREEAM assessments, followed by an introduction to Detailed HVAC illustrated through use of the new v3.2 HVAC templates.

*         Day 5, 22nd March, Detailed HVAC. This day provides a deeper study of some the latest DesignBuilder EnergyPlus HVAC functionality covering a range of common systems and control methods. The new simulation results viewer will be used to check EnergyPlus HVAC outputs in detail.

Kevin,

 

Is this not because the room heat loads and cooling loads calculation sheet
pulls results from your .clg and .htg files not your .aps file?

I'm using all prototype systems, and they all have humidity controllers
attached to the coil/room when imported.  Looking at those controllers they
have a setpoint of 50% RH with a 10% deadband.  I don't know if that's
standard with the prototype systems or if it's pulling that from my room
conditions tab, but either way everything seems to be pointing to 50% RH.

Difficult to diagnose from your description but certain zone level system
settings become redundant when you use aphvac. 

Are you using the controllers in aphvac to control humidity via coils or are
you expecting aphvac to the "find" settings in your zone "room
conditions"tab?

It's not always obvious what settings become redundant.

I'm having issues with humidity in some models I'm running while trying to
use ApacheHVAC. I have set my "Maximum Percent Saturation" to 50%, and in
the VE ASHRAE Loads Results Data tab of the loads data spreadsheet it shows
that max input as 50%. If I go into Vista and highlight my "filename.asp"
file for the run that is linked to my ApacheHVAC system and run the "Heating
and Cooling Report" and look at the "Comfort - Occupied" section all of my
rooms have a Max% Relative Humidity of 85-100%. This is the same if I select
"Systems" from the drop down and investigate Relative Humidity on a node by
node basis at the rooms in my ApacheHVAC system.

Rooms in my model that are not assigned to an ApacheHVAC system and are left
with the default ApacheSystems system show that they are being maintained at
50% RH.

All rooms whether assigned to the ApacheHVAC systems or the default systems
show that they're letting room temperatures float to Unoccupied setpoints
during the "Comfort - Occupied" times.

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated, the buildings I'm trying to
work on are located in Louisville, KY and Tampa, FL so not accounting for
dehumidification is going to vastly effect the cooling load.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <770DA51B8CC79343A32830010D6E379A0A688F@PJWXMB-0001L.LEC-ADMIN.dmu.ac.uk>

Hi All,

Sorry for cross-posting... We are starting the second round trial of jEPlus Simulation Server (JESS). The first round was open to jEPlus users and DesignBuilder competition participants only. This time it is open to everyone who is willing to have a taste of "cloud computing". You can send jEPlus projects or plain EnergyPlus simulation jobs to the DMU cluster, and then sit back waiting for results to come back. This page explains how it works: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jeplus/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:jess_service

All you need to do is following a few simple steps:

1.       Log on to jEPlus website, register a new account if you are not yet a user, and download the JESS Client (with EP-Launch Support) package

2.       Send an email to jeplus.services at gmail.com<mailto:jeplus.services at gmail.com>, and ask for a JESS account. Please indicate in the email the type of jobs you intend to run

3.       Depending on your simulation jobs, separate instructions on how to use the Client are provided on the website

Since the number of accounts we can offer is limited, they will be provided on first come first served basis. If the demand is high, it may take a couple of days before we get back to you. This is a free trial, i.e. we are not charging you anything  for using this facility. However, running E+ simulations remotely can cause high data traffic, so be careful if your internet connection is not unlimited. The trial will run for at least 6 weeks starting today.

Best regards,

Yi

Kevin,

Depending on your system, if you've got high levels of infiltration in a high humidity area, large latent loads within the spaces etc. downstream or room RH could potentially be high. Otherwise, if it's not meeting the off-coil RH, either you've got a profile issue (your coil is effectively off) or some part of your system is undersized. You'll need to interrogate step by step to find the issue.

Taking Chris' point further ApacheHVAC doesn't 'look' at any value from your Room Conditions tab. In that respect it's a dumb beast. It's up to you to make sure the room conditions and setpoint controllers within ApacheHVAC match, so that your loads and your coil/airflow sizing tie up.

Hope that helps,
Ed

All rooms whether assigned to the ApacheHVAC systems or the default systems show that they're letting room temperatures float to Unoccupied setpoints during the "Comfort - Occupied" times.

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated, the buildings I'm trying to work on are located in Louisville, KY and Tampa, FL so not accounting for dehumidification is going to vastly effect the cooling load.

Thanks,

Absolutely!  I regularly use COMcheck to document my proposed LPD tallies and the corresponding baseline LPD inputs.

The only caveat to be aware of is that COMcheck presently cannot document 90.1-2007 inclusive of addendum i, which is of concern if you specifically are determining/documenting exterior lighting wattages for SSc8 for LEED 2009 projects registered after November 2011.  I've contacted the developers, and from the response I understand they do not intend to address this issue.

Christian,

Your question is a bit puzzling, since COMcheck doesn?t literally ?report? LPDs.  It reveals the allowable LPDs based on the energy code specified by the user at input time; but it?s the responsibility of the user to input the actual (proposed) LPDs by either the whole-building method or the space-by-space method.  COMcheck only tells you whether you?re exceeding the code limitation you specified.  

I would think that you could always rely on the soundness of the ?allowable? LPDs shown in COMcheck, since they are reflecting the code requirements.  However, and energy simulation model inputs always need to be the LPDs that are actually in the building design.

Hi Larry,

To read it another way, COMcheck literally does generate compliance reports which document proposed and allowable LPD?s in an itemized fashion.  I answered previously assuming Christian is asking specifically about whether the reports themselves are considered acceptable documentation for LPD tallies/calcs.

Such reports, while intended to document prescriptive code compliance, can serve double-duty as effective LEED model documentation for derived LPD inputs (and other credits).  Since LEED EAc1 modeling requires documenting both the baseline and proposed model LPD?s (which correspond to the prescribed allowable and installed watts, respectively), I?ve found COMcheck compliance reports to be quite a timesaver over the self-made spreadsheets I used to assemble.

The .cck files incidentally, by nature of their common structure, are also easier to pass around with other designers to pick up and work with, relative to a ?roll your own documentation? approach.

Regards,

~Nick

COMcheck LPDs are based on inputs made by design team when documenting code
compliance. Quality of these inputs depend on how seriously energy code is
taken by design team and code officials, and vary from project to project.
In my experience, they are often way off, and seem to be taken out of thin
air. Aside from that, based on Table G3.1, Proposed Building Performance
column ".a. Where a complete lighting system exists, the actual lighting
power for each thermal block shall be used in the model." LPDs by thermal
block are not entered/reported in COMCheck, so I don't really see how
COMCheck LPDs may be used in the model even if they were correct.

Hi List!

Here's some additional clarification resulting from some off-list discussion:

In my experience, the person demonstrating energy code compliance and the person doing the energy modeling is often the same person (me!), so I'm writing from a perspective that it's a given the COMcheck reports are assembled with the same rigor expected of the energy model.  In function, I personally recognize COMcheck reports as a time-saving tool to simultaneously document model inputs while demonstrating code compliance.

Those providing energy modeling services independent of those producing compliance documentation should at least make themselves aware that there may be conflicts between both sets of documentation to watch out for.  I do not think this possibility should discourage you from using COMcheck or similar tools to enhance your personal workflow and documentation.  The format by which you choose to document your model should not have any bearing on whether you will need to explain discrepancies with other documentation.

When others are assembling COMcheck reports (or other compliance documentation), as the energy modeler I will make a point to review our inputs against each other for corrections, as there shouldn't be two sets of documentation floating out there with conflicting results.  I take on QC measures like this to avoid such review commentary altogether.  In a positive light, making such checks is an easy way to QC your model inputs against the actual design, and may even reveal design decisions which haven't been realized in the model.

Hope this helps!

~Nick

Hi folks,

Just a quick note to let you all know that the Radiance installers have been updated, and are available for download at the NREL OpenStudio site. These packages include the brand new 'gendaymtx' utility that greatly speeds up the annual calculation when using the daylight coefficient tools in Radiance.

We hope to add gendaymtx into the OpenStudio tool chain and workflow in the coming weeks, but in the meantime, I'm sure Greg would appreciate any feedback from users willing to try it out on their own, especially those Windows users out there. There's a man page explaining its use, and it's pretty straightforward.

Grab yours here:

Ok, bye.

Hi German,

Yes, gendaymtx is in the HEAD, the installers in the NREL site are based on the HEAD as of Thursday of last week, I believe. And no, the GPU dctimestep is not needed for this to work (nor is that version of dctimestep in HEAD). Nope, gendaymtx works with all the standard Radiance tools. You simply need a weather file formatted the way it wants, which is the same format as a DAYSIM weather file. Andy McNeil notes that DAYSIM has a tool to convert the EnergyPlus weather file format (.epw) to the DAYSIM format. OpenStudio will be modified to automatically provide gendaymtx with the epw data in the format it expects. I noticed that gendaymtx also accepts weather data from STDIN, and that there is an option to feed it less than a full year (8760) of data. We will leverage this ability in OpenStudio for sure, as well.

Exciting times!

- Rob

Good to know!

Is gendaymtx available in the HEAD version of Radiance? Is the GPU version of dctimestep needed for using that?

THANKS VERY MUCH

Project -14 (Tall-Bldg ? Infiltration due to Stack-Effect) is shown in website http://bepan.info/, tab ?Proj-Bldgs? http://bepan.info/proj-bldgs and click ?P-14-Tall-Bldg-Press? http://bepan.info/proj-bldgs/p-14-tall-bldg-press
 
The methodology of the Excel program shown in the website.  It calculates the infiltration in vertical section floors of tall buildings taking into account stack effect for each section. Wind Velocity and Direction was not considered so all exposure orientations are equivalent.
 
Excel program examples and summary for 85-story and 180-story buildings in Minneapolis and Dubai are shown in (open or download):

A typical High-Rise Mixed-Use used for teaching is shown in website http://bepan.info/ and tab ?Proj-Bldgs? http://bepan.info/proj-bldgs and click ?P-14-Tall-Bldg-Press? http://bepan.info/proj-bldgs/p13-high-rise-bldg 
 
The vertical sections of the examples include (1) ground-lobby, (2) retail, (3) financial, (4) general-office, (5) hotel services, (6) hotel rooms, (7) apartments, (8) dining-miscellaneous. 
 
The sections are not identical.
Each section used different floor plans & envelope types.
Different envelope types were selected from the CONTAM library for each section. 
The envelope properties are from NIST?s CONTAM library.
5a - CONTAM-Library - Enclosure Leakage Areas (Infiltr-Flow at Press-Temp)
5a is an Excel program that converts the CONTAM leakage areas into infiltration flows at different indoor-outdoor pressure & temperature differences in SI and IP units.
5b - CONTAM-Library - from NIST - Enclosure-Leakage-Areas
5b is the original leakage areas in the CONTAM library.
 
To do this for 8760 hours in an energy program would require excessive execution relative to the significance infiltration energy compared to total energy which is about 1% in summer and 12% in winter for a cold climate like Minneapolis. 
 
Program description is shown in:
3a - Tall-Bldg - Stack-Effect-Infltr ? Excel-Program - User Guide - Report
3b - Infiltration in Tall Buildings - DOE21E & eQUEST Analysis
3c - Figures - Excel Program User Guide - Infiltr in Tall-Bldgs
 
The Excel program uses pressure, temperature & humidity conditions indoors & outdoors but does not take into account wind velocity and direction and therefore exposure orientations. Outdoor temperature is calculated for altitudes based on the ground design weather for summer & winter. 
 
It shows how to obtain ? (To-Ti), ? (Wo-Wi) and ? (Ho-Hi) from 8760 weather file
This method of ? (To-Ti), ? (Wo-Wi) and ? (Ho-Hi) from 8760 weather file is equivalent to 8760 hour calculation of energy programs as shown in:
4a - The ? method is equivalent to 8760 hour calculations of energy programs
 
The energy estimate of infiltration is based on:
DESIGN DATASUMMERWINTER
Indoor DB (F) = Ti7572
Indoor RH %) = RHi5035
?(To:Ti) for 8760-hrs7,654250,474
?(Wo:Wi) for 8760-hrs7.7316.81
? (Ho:Hi) for 8760-hrs8,81775,425

Indoor humidity ratio Wi (lbs/lb) and enthalpy Hi (btu/lb) is calculated from the dry bulb temperature (Ti) and relative humidity (RHi)
 
The difference between indoor and outdoor Temperature (To-Ti), Humidity Ratio (Wo-Wi) and Enthalpy (Ho-Hi) for summer & winter conditions for 8760 hours is required for the Tall-Bldg-Infiltr Excel program. 
 
Instructions for obtaining these values are under ?C1c ?Excel Weather-Analysis of Converted DOE2.bin file?.  Go to website http://bepan.info/  and then http://bepan.info/weather    and open or download:
Using Q?(To~Ti,Ts), Q?(Wo~W,Ws), Q?(Ho~H,Hs) apprx = 8760-Hr-Calcs
1 - TEMPLATE - DOE2 BIN Weather to Excel & Analyze
2 - TEMPLATE - Sum (Ti,Ts~To, Wi,Ws~Wo & Hi,Hs~Ho) 8760 Hrs?
3 - LOCATIONS - Sum (Ti,Ts~To, Wi,Ws~Wo & Hi,Hs~Ho) for 8760-hrs?
 
The program requires converting DOE2 8760-hour ?Weather.bin? binary file to a ?Weather.ft? text file using the DOE2 weather processor, and then converting the text file to an Excel file ?Weather.xlsx?.  Go to website http://bepan.info/  and then http://bepan.info/weather    
Under ?C1a - INSTRUCTIONS - DOE2 Wthr - *.dat - *.bin - *.xls? open or download:
9 - Weather _NCDC.tpe to DOE2.bin to Tables-Charts
11 - Template - Shanghai ? DOE2-Weather-Analysis - Short
12 - Template - Beijing ? DOE2-Weather-Analysis - Long

?Weather.epw? must be first converted to ?Weather.bin? binary file.  Instructions are under:
?C1b - INSTRUCTIONS ? Converting EnergyPlus Weather Files?
1 - Convert Energy-Plus.EPW to DOE2.BIN
2 - Convert EPW Text File to Charts-Reports
5 - Original - USA_MN_Minneapolis-St.Paul.Intl.AP.726580_TMY3.epw
6 - Edited - USA_MN_Minneapolis-St.Paul.Intl.AP.726580_TMY3.epw
7 - Read Text File into Excel - EPW-Minneapolis.xlsx
8 ? Template-Excel - Minneapolis - EPW-Weather-Analysis.xls
8 ? Template-Excel - Minneapolis - EPW-Weather-Analysis.xls
 
It shows that:
(1) % Infiltration in large commercial tall buildings is about: 
Less than 1 % in Summer, and about 15 % in Winter
(2) Lights & Equip is 60 % of total energy in summer and DHW is 10 % of total energy in winter
(3) For different types envelopes (selected from the CONTAM library) the infiltration per envelope area is between: 
0.02 and 0.09 cfm per sqft of envelope area in summer 
0.04 and 0.16 cfm per sqft of envelope area in winter 
using stack effect & varying the outdoor conditions due to elevation
(4) The infiltration cost ($)/year is: 
$138,065 ($0.21/sf Envelop-Area) for the 82 floor-bldg and 
$809,768 (($0.48/sf Envelope-Area) for the 177 floor-bldg. 
It is based on $0.15 per kwh for electricity and $0.75 per therm for natural gas.
(5) eQUEST default is 0.038 cfm per sqft summer and winter for all envelope types.
 
The envelope properties are from NIST?s CONTAM library.
5a - CONTAM-Library - Enclosure Leakage Areas (Infiltr-Flow at Press-Temp)
 
Below are some of my views:
Modern tall bldgs envelopes are steel-frame and glass (very light).
The envelope panels are manufactured off-site to exact dimensions using numerical control machines that allow for glass & frame expansion & contraction for the site location.
Also the requirement for entrance vestibules with a revolving door on the outside minimizes the stack effect infiltration in tall bldgs
There is less leakage in these bldgs compared older bldgs such as the 102 Empire State Bldg in New York built in 1930.
 
For air-conditioned pressurized bldg, the infiltration in summer can be neglected compared to the internal & other external loads.
I think stack-effect infiltration-exfiltration applies only to very tall bldgs.
For all other bldgs is no need to go to all this trouble.
Infiltration is greatest during cold weather when the air outside is denser than the dry air inside.
 
Wind velocity and direction also makes a difference. 
There is infiltration in a pressurized bldg even in cold weather.
Infiltration air enters from the windward side and exits from the leeward side (exfiltration)??
In summer the colder air inside is denser than the hotter air outside.
Infiltration is still a factor in pressurized bldgs even in summer.
 
There other specific issues that can be analyzed independently of 8760 hour energy programs.  Go to website http://bepan.info/  and then tab ?Engg-Calcs?  http://bepan.info/engg-calcs to review some Excel programs that were created to study problems associated with particular projects such as.
1a - LCCA-Economics-Tables-Generator
1b - LCCA-Life-Cycle-Cost-Analysis
1c - LCCA-Lighting T5 versus T8 Cost
2 - Altitude VS Air-Properties
3a - Design-Weather-Generator
3b - PV-Solar-Radiation-Calculations
3c - Envelope-Radiation-Loads-Estimate 
 
Also under tab ?Design? are preliminary databases that can be developed and expanded such as: 
2 - Design-Standards
3 - Design-Criteria
5 - Energy-Savings-Options
6 - Typical-Utility-Rates
?7 - Bldg-Cost-Data??
11 - Pipe-Sizing-Data
14 - Pumps-Fans
 
The website includes my notes for graduate courses and assisting Ph.D. candidates in ?Energy Efficient Building Design?.  The objectives are shown in http://bepan.info/contents Open or download:
1 - BEPAR OBJECTIVES (draft for review at IIT-meeting 11-4-11
2 - BEPAR Proposed Database Organization & Forms to Submit Case Studies
BEPAN - OBJECTIVES:
(1) Develop case studies for different types of buildings with energy conservation options using different energy analysis programs. A statistical database of building performance by building types can be useful to A-E firms as a reference guide in the design of, and for projecting the performance of new buildings.
(2) Develop case studies of campuses and townships. Campuses & townships can save energy by using cogeneration plant for power and HVAC. Example: Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) comparing the present IIT campus Mechanical-Electrical Systems with a proposed central system that includes a Cogeneration plant for power and HVAC - http://www.iit.edu/about/campus_map.shtml
(3) Develop courses and graduate programs in energy efficient building design and would emphasize design practice using case studies. The two year graduate programs can be taught part-time by adjunct faculty working full-time at A-E firms if the basic teaching notes are developed by the group.
(4) Develop research topics by Academia in A-E design submitted by A-E design firms. A-E design firms cannot justify the overhead cost of Research & Development but a Group representing A-E design firms can accomplish this with the support of academic research institutions.

Hi Sheelam,

probably this is not possible without tweaking. As far as I am aware,
Design Builder uses the standard backwards algorithm of Radiance. That
one is not really made for typical solar tubes, if you want to consider
direct sun and you have no diffuser on top of the tube. If you would run
your Radiance simulations directly, you could either use a sky where the
direct sun contribution would be spread over a wider solid angle (see
Tregenza's sky subdivision scheme) or apply extensions such as the
Photon Map. I doubt that these are available in Design Builder (though I
do not really know this for sure). If you need a front end, you can have
a look at Daysim, which includes the Photon Map and also supports the
daylight coefficient method using Tregenza and higher resolution sky models.

I would recommend a look at the Radiance workshop presentation of the
recent years, which are all available at www.radiance-online.org.

Cheers, Lars.

I know nothing much about DesignBuilder, but if it uses Radiance for the daylighting calculations, the best way to accurately model a tubular daylight device is to obtain the photometric distribution file AKA ".ies file" for the make and size of TDD you are modeling. They are all somewhat of a hack, since they attempt to characterize the distribution and intensity of a thing that redirects an infinitely variable light source, using a single file. But there are ways to scale the intensity, and even to account for exterior obstructions at the roof aperture, by doing some evaluations of the global exterior illuminance and comparing it to the assumption that the photo metric file made, and scaling accordingly.

In any event, this is really the best way to characterize a TDD in Radiance, because you are treating the luminous aperture as a direct light source, rather than attempting to use Radiance's indirect calculation to hope enough random rays find their way up the TDD and out to the hemisphere and actually intercept the sun and other major contributors (like big puffy cumulus clouds), which is unlikely at best.

HI all

Do you have any idea why there are only three packages approved for
California title 24 ACM?

Approved software list is at link below.

Because the California Energy Commission has a thorough and some would say onerous certification procedure requiring the software vender to do a suite of 160 certification test runs to demonstrate that their software produces results that are consistent with the Commission's results.  All this is spelled out in Chapter 5 (if my memory is correct) of the Commission's 350+ page ACM (Alternate Compliance Method) manual. How this will change in the future is not clear since the Commission has embarked in 2007 on a new procedure where they would take charge of the entire compliance calculation procedure, instead of specifying the rules.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan Power
Message-ID: <51279BE0.4090007@wichert.org>

This is a DOE-2 question, I think, but I am applying it to EnergyPro.  I 
am asking here in the hopes that some will have a more in-depth 
knowledge of DOE-2 and how it relates to fan power.  I am also hoping 
that some here will be able to reflect on the theory and application of 
fan power and energy as it relates to actual systems and modeling.

When inputting indoor fan power, I have used many sources for the fan 
power.  I sometimes use the motor nameplate, which I believe is too high 
in every case.

I also sometimes use FLA or RLA, which I also do not believe are 
accurate, but sometimes give more realistic numbers.

Some manufacturers give fan BHP at design conditions, which I find to be 
very helpful, but not everybody is that helpful.

It has been suggested that I calculate the fan BHP using the theoretical 
formula *** Fan BHP = (cfm x static press "w.c.) / (6356 x fan 
efficiency) *** and then use a conservative fan efficiency (maybe 50%) 
for a good number.  This gives a much lower value than the other 
methods, and I am trying to see if there is anything wrong with this 
approach.

As I understand the usage, indoor fan power is divided by motor and 
drive efficiency to come up with fan energy.  So the fan BHP is the 
starting point.  Having this too high drives up fan energy, sometimes 
dramatically, and can influence the proposed case quite a bit if there 
are lots of fans, even small fans.


Any thoughts on this approach would be very much appreciated.

Robert,

 

I've also run into problems obtaining combined (fan and motor) efficiency
and input power, mostly with terminal units such as heat pumps and fan coil
units but also with individual fans.  What I've often done is used the watts
listed in their electrical tables.  For example, below if you take their
size 20 at high fan speed, they classify the motor HP at 1/30HP or 25W
(output power).  I've taken the subsequent columns to mean input power so
the watts at 115V is then 57W which would make the motor is 44% efficient
and that seems reasonable to me.  The listed amps don't necessarily equate
to the same wattages, they are usually higher so my only theory is that this
is the starting amps.  

 

I'd be interested in finding out what other have to say.  I have tried
talking to some local equipment reps without any luck.

 

Aaron

Message-ID: <CAB_-mWPv5VdRp67kbZk+85J27UZOC3doTgrTqL8wPwPVFKJSfw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

has anyone curves on the part ;load performance of a brine water heat pump
with invertor technology?

We are considering applying this technology in a NZEB renovation (
www.zehr.be), but most available models are oversized. The smallest has a
nominal output of 10kW, and can modulate down to around 3kW. We will use it
in winter to heat and produce sanitary hot water when the solar thermal
system does not produce enough.

Thermal buffering can be done in the buidling structure (floor heating) and
with a tank.

Estimated peak heating load is around 4 to 5 kW for house heating, normal 4
person family demand for sanitary hot water.

Thanks for any suggestions!

Leen

A 50% efficient MOTOR cannot be correct.   50% efficient fan, yes.  

I actually think a lot of the amps given are something akin to MCA.

Based on Aaron?s calculations, it sounds like 44% = motor efficiency x fan efficiency,  That?s the net which affects energy use ? how it is composed doesn?t matter too much.
Small motors often have terrible efficiency.  The same is true for small fans!  Put them together and it?s pretty dismal.

Small FHP HVAC motors can have efficiencies below 50% which is why ECM motors are becomming popular in that size range - they are typically 65-85% efficient.  See in the presentation below where w/cfm is 1/3 with ECM vs PSC.

Robert,



I?ve also run into problems obtaining combined (fan and motor) efficiency and input power, mostly with terminal units such as heat pumps and fan coil units but also with individual fans.  What I?ve often done is used the watts listed in their electrical tables.  For example, below if you take their size 20 at high fan speed, they classify the motor HP at 1/30HP or 25W (output power).  I?ve taken the subsequent columns to mean input power so the watts at 115V is then 57W which would make the motor is 44% efficient and that seems reasonable to me.  The listed amps don?t necessarily equate to the same wattages, they are usually higher so my only theory is that this is the starting amps.



I?d be interested in finding out what other have to say.  I have tried talking to some local equipment reps without any luck.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan Power



This is a DOE-2 question, I think, but I am applying it to EnergyPro.  I

am asking here in the hopes that some will have a more in-depth

knowledge of DOE-2 and how it relates to fan power.  I am also hoping

that some here will be able to reflect on the theory and application of

fan power and energy as it relates to actual systems and modeling.



When inputting indoor fan power, I have used many sources for the fan

power.  I sometimes use the motor nameplate, which I believe is too high

in every case.



I also sometimes use FLA or RLA, which I also do not believe are

accurate, but sometimes give more realistic numbers.



Some manufacturers give fan BHP at design conditions, which I find to be

very helpful, but not everybody is that helpful.



It has been suggested that I calculate the fan BHP using the theoretical

formula *** Fan BHP = (cfm x static press "w.c.) / (6356 x fan

efficiency) *** and then use a conservative fan efficiency (maybe 50%)

for a good number.  This gives a much lower value than the other

methods, and I am trying to see if there is anything wrong with this

approach.



As I understand the usage, indoor fan power is divided by motor and

drive efficiency to come up with fan energy.  So the fan BHP is the

starting point.  Having this too high drives up fan energy, sometimes

dramatically, and can influence the proposed case quite a bit if there

are lots of fans, even small fans.





Any thoughts on this approach would be very much appreciated.

The data is very hard to come by, but 44% for the motor only I believe is about right in those smaller motors.  35% wouldn't surprise me with maybe a 60-65% direct drive blower so 20% wire-air wouldn't be out of the ballpark in my opinion.  The motors are historically single phase split capacitor historically and a poorer quality than a small 3 phase induction motor.   

On a tangent, 3 phase induction motor efficiencies really drop off below 1.5 HP or so.  Unless of a very high quality / HE then the part load efficiency can also be very poor despite the full load efficiency looking OK.  So a small 3 phase motor could have 85% full load / full speed efficiency but at 25% load (say 50% speed and 50% torque) the efficiency can be dramatically poorer.  We have managed to get part load motor efficiency data from TECO and others in the past that go down to 50% torque but at full speed (thus 50% load) so not that helpful as variable speed / variable pressure systems spend time at much lower loads.  The data does typically show a peak efficiency at 75% load however where I2R losses have dropped but eddy current and other losses haven't started to dominate the losses and thus drive efficiency down which they do at lower loads. 

We have a large project where we have asked contractors and thus suppliers to test select equipment on their test rigs to generate better part load data.  We will see how we go.

Fortunately with a lot of smaller equipment digital motors or electrically commutated motors have lifted efficiencies dramatically as they are direct drive and being digital the variable speed controls are intrinsic to the motor.

Getting part load efficiencies out of VSD drive suppliers we have found to be like drawing blood out of a stone.  I assume that there is a large fixed component of losses so at part load in % terms the VSD losses could grow from 3% say to 7-10%. Don't forget your belts as well if you are taking a fan manufacturer's bhp figures as they typically do not include the belts - maybe 3-5% in losses if well aligned and tensioned.

If you have variable flow, variable pressure systems that spend a lot of time at very low loads, the VSD can affect the motor efficiency at lower loads.  There was an ASHRAE Transactions paper or RP from the late 90's I recall that showed motor part load efficiency without a VSD drive and then with and there was a difference.  If I remember correctly they did the test with a SE motor but may have also done with a HE motor and the HE motors are more resilient to the impacts of a VSD.

I guess all I am trying to say is that getting a full load design point is one thing, but make sure it includes all the losses and more importantly make sure you take a view on what happens at part load as that is where larger modern systems operate.  Smaller systems may be constant flow / constant speed but increasingly we are seeing variable speed FCUs etc available on the market using ECMs.

Graham

Well, OK, I will bow to your expertise, but a 44% motor sounds pretty 
dismal to me, as you suggest.

Would a conservative number be 20%, air to wire?  Is so, I am looking 
for FAN efficiency.  NOT motor or drive efficiency, which are taken care 
of by the modeling software separately.

Would 50% for FAN efficiency by reasonable?

If so, this allows me to use the theoretical air BHP equation to 
calculate fan BHP at design conditions using 50% fan efficiency. This 
would be a big breakthrough for me, actually.

I do like the idea of actual testing, which is rare as hen's teeth.  
Even amp numbers are way too high.  I have had RLA that show more HP 
than the nominal motor HP.  That's gotta be wrong.

I have not seen a single ECM fan coil unit with an improved fan BHP.  
Not one.  If you got one, please share your knowledge!


Cheers from sunny California.

Why don't you see if you can get fan curves for some small fans - they'll show fan efficiency.
p.s., I think 50% for the fan is darn good for most rooftop equipment; anything smaller will almost certainly be worse.  I did some modeling for a manufacturer a while back who used ~2,000 cfm backward inclined fans - 40% static efficiency

So a small 3 phase motor could have 85% full load / full speed efficiency but at 25% load (say 50% speed and 50% torque) the efficiency can be dramatically poorer.  We have managed to get part load motor efficiency data from TECO and others in the past that go down to 50% torque but at full speed (thus 50% load) so not that helpful as variable speed / variable pressure systems spend time at much lower loads.  The data does typically show a peak efficiency at 75% load however where I2R losses have dropped but eddy current and other losses haven't started to dominate the losses and thus drive efficiency down which they do at lower loads.

We have a large project where we have asked contractors and thus suppliers to test select equipment on their test rigs to generate better part load data.  We will see how we go.

Fortunately with a lot of smaller equipment digital motors or electrically commutated motors have lifted efficiencies dramatically as they are direct drive and being digital the variable speed controls are intrinsic to the motor.

Getting part load efficiencies out of VSD drive suppliers we have found to be like drawing blood out of a stone.  I assume that there is a large fixed component of losses so at part load in % terms the VSD losses could grow from 3% say to 7-10%. Don't forget your belts as well if you are taking a fan manufacturer's bhp figures as they typically do not include the belts - maybe 3-5% in losses if well aligned and tensioned.

If you have variable flow, variable pressure systems that spend a lot of time at very low loads, the VSD can affect the motor efficiency at lower loads.  There was an ASHRAE Transactions paper or RP from the late 90's I recall that showed motor part load efficiency without a VSD drive and then with and there was a difference.  If I remember correctly they did the test with a SE motor but may have also done with a HE motor and the HE motors are more resilient to the impacts of a VSD.

I guess all I am trying to say is that getting a full load design point is one thing, but make sure it includes all the losses and more importantly make sure you take a view on what happens at part load as that is where larger modern systems operate.  Smaller systems may be constant flow / constant speed but increasingly we are seeing variable speed FCUs etc available on the market using ECMs.

Graham

A 50% efficient MOTOR cannot be correct.   50% efficient fan, yes.

I actually think a lot of the amps given are something akin to MCA.

Let's see what others say...

Robert,

I've also run into problems obtaining combined (fan and motor) efficiency and input power, mostly with terminal units such as heat pumps and fan coil units but also with individual fans.  What I've often done is used the watts listed in their electrical tables.  For example, below if you take their size 20 at high fan speed, they classify the motor HP at 1/30HP or 25W (output power).  I've taken the subsequent columns to mean input power so the watts at 115V is then 57W which would make the motor is 44% efficient and that seems reasonable to me.  The listed amps don't necessarily equate to the same wattages, they are usually higher so my only theory is that this is the starting amps.

I'd be interested in finding out what other have to say.  I have tried talking to some local equipment reps without any luck.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan Power

This is a DOE-2 question, I think, but I am applying it to EnergyPro.  I
am asking here in the hopes that some will have a more in-depth
knowledge of DOE-2 and how it relates to fan power.  I am also hoping
that some here will be able to reflect on the theory and application of
fan power and energy as it relates to actual systems and modeling.

When inputting indoor fan power, I have used many sources for the fan
power.  I sometimes use the motor nameplate, which I believe is too high
in every case.

I also sometimes use FLA or RLA, which I also do not believe are
accurate, but sometimes give more realistic numbers.

Some manufacturers give fan BHP at design conditions, which I find to be
very helpful, but not everybody is that helpful.

It has been suggested that I calculate the fan BHP using the theoretical
formula *** Fan BHP = (cfm x static press "w.c.) / (6356 x fan
efficiency) *** and then use a conservative fan efficiency (maybe 50%)
for a good number.  This gives a much lower value than the other
methods, and I am trying to see if there is anything wrong with this
approach.

As I understand the usage, indoor fan power is divided by motor and
drive efficiency to come up with fan energy.  So the fan BHP is the
starting point.  Having this too high drives up fan energy, sometimes
dramatically, and can influence the proposed case quite a bit if there
are lots of fans, even small fans.


Any thoughts on this approach would be very much appreciated.

Yes, good ideas, Jim, but I am disappointed in your 2,000 CFM fan with 
40% static efficiency. That's scary.

We use Aspen fan coils, and I don't know if they have fan curves. I'll 
ask.  They are most likely smaller though, so even more scary.

Robert,
It's a major fan manufacturer!  I'm not too surprised (just a little).  These happen to use ECM and the variable speed feature covers a lot of "sins", but you are right - a bit scary.

Well, OK, I will bow to your expertise, but a 44% motor sounds pretty dismal to me, as you suggest.

Would a conservative number be 20%, air to wire?  Is so, I am looking for FAN efficiency.  NOT motor or drive efficiency, which are taken care of by the modeling software separately.

Would 50% for FAN efficiency by reasonable?

If so, this allows me to use the theoretical air BHP equation to calculate fan BHP at design conditions using 50% fan efficiency.  This would be a big breakthrough for me, actually.

I do like the idea of actual testing, which is rare as hen's teeth.  Even amp numbers are way too high.  I have had RLA that show more HP than the nominal motor HP.  That's gotta be wrong.

I have not seen a single ECM fan coil unit with an improved fan BHP.  Not one.  If you got one, please share your knowledge!


Cheers from sunny California.

The data is very hard to come by, but 44% for the motor only I believe is about right in those smaller motors.  35% wouldn't surprise me with maybe a 60-65% direct drive blower so 20% wire-air wouldn't be out of the ballpark in my opinion.  The motors are historically single phase split capacitor historically and a poorer quality than a small 3 phase induction motor.

On a tangent, 3 phase induction motor efficiencies really drop off below 1.5 HP or so.  Unless of a very high quality / HE then the part load efficiency can also be very poor despite the full load efficiency looking OK.  So a small 3 phase motor could have 85% full load / full speed efficiency but at 25% load (say 50% speed and 50% torque) the efficiency can be dramatically poorer.  We have managed to get part load motor efficiency data from TECO and others in the past that go down to 50% torque but at full speed (thus 50% load) so not that helpful as variable speed / variable pressure systems spend time at much lower loads.  The data does typically show a peak efficiency at 75% load however where I2R losses have dropped but eddy current and other losses haven't started to dominate the losses and thus drive efficiency down which they do at lower loads.

We have a large project where we have asked contractors and thus suppliers to test select equipment on their test rigs to generate better part load data.  We will see how we go.

Fortunately with a lot of smaller equipment digital motors or electrically commutated motors have lifted efficiencies dramatically as they are direct drive and being digital the variable speed controls are intrinsic to the motor.

Getting part load efficiencies out of VSD drive suppliers we have found to be like drawing blood out of a stone.  I assume that there is a large fixed component of losses so at part load in % terms the VSD losses could grow from 3% say to 7-10%. Don't forget your belts as well if you are taking a fan manufacturer's bhp figures as they typically do not include the belts - maybe 3-5% in losses if well aligned and tensioned.

If you have variable flow, variable pressure systems that spend a lot of time at very low loads, the VSD can affect the motor efficiency at lower loads.  There was an ASHRAE Transactions paper or RP from the late 90's I recall that showed motor part load efficiency without a VSD drive and then with and there was a difference.  If I remember correctly they did the test with a SE motor but may have also done with a HE motor and the HE motors are more resilient to the impacts of a VSD.

I guess all I am trying to say is that getting a full load design point is one thing, but make sure it includes all the losses and more importantly make sure you take a view on what happens at part load as that is where larger modern systems operate.  Smaller systems may be constant flow / constant speed but increasingly we are seeing variable speed FCUs etc available on the market using ECMs.

Graham

Based on Aaron's calculations, it sounds like 44% = motor efficiency x fan efficiency,  That's the net which affects energy use - how it is composed doesn't matter too much.
Small motors often have terrible efficiency.  The same is true for small fans!  Put them together and it's pretty dismal.

A 50% efficient MOTOR cannot be correct.   50% efficient fan, yes.

I actually think a lot of the amps given are something akin to MCA.

Let's see what others say...

Robert,

I've also run into problems obtaining combined (fan and motor) efficiency and input power, mostly with terminal units such as heat pumps and fan coil units but also with individual fans.  What I've often done is used the watts listed in their electrical tables.  For example, below if you take their size 20 at high fan speed, they classify the motor HP at 1/30HP or 25W (output power).  I've taken the subsequent columns to mean input power so the watts at 115V is then 57W which would make the motor is 44% efficient and that seems reasonable to me.  The listed amps don't necessarily equate to the same wattages, they are usually higher so my only theory is that this is the starting amps.

I'd be interested in finding out what other have to say.  I have tried talking to some local equipment reps without any luck.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan Power

This is a DOE-2 question, I think, but I am applying it to EnergyPro.  I
am asking here in the hopes that some will have a more in-depth
knowledge of DOE-2 and how it relates to fan power.  I am also hoping
that some here will be able to reflect on the theory and application of
fan power and energy as it relates to actual systems and modeling.

When inputting indoor fan power, I have used many sources for the fan
power.  I sometimes use the motor nameplate, which I believe is too high
in every case.

I also sometimes use FLA or RLA, which I also do not believe are
accurate, but sometimes give more realistic numbers.

Some manufacturers give fan BHP at design conditions, which I find to be
very helpful, but not everybody is that helpful.

It has been suggested that I calculate the fan BHP using the theoretical
formula *** Fan BHP = (cfm x static press "w.c.) / (6356 x fan
efficiency) *** and then use a conservative fan efficiency (maybe 50%)
for a good number.  This gives a much lower value than the other
methods, and I am trying to see if there is anything wrong with this
approach.

As I understand the usage, indoor fan power is divided by motor and
drive efficiency to come up with fan energy.  So the fan BHP is the
starting point.  Having this too high drives up fan energy, sometimes
dramatically, and can influence the proposed case quite a bit if there
are lots of fans, even small fans.


Any thoughts on this approach would be very much appreciated.

Descriptions



Presentation 1


Title: EnergyPlus for Early Design and Single Zone Studies; David Fannon AIA, Senior Associate, Senior High Performance Specialist, Syska Hennessy Group, Inc.

 Description: This talk focuses on using COMFEN to run simplified EnergyPlus models which inform early design-decisions and perform simple single-zone studies quickly and relatively inexpensively.  Using examples from recent projects, we will discuss ways to use COMFEN both an interface for rapid simulation and as a ready-made database that can be manipulated outside the GUI for comparative studies.  The presentation concludes with some notes on analyzing the results, the limitations of the tool and Quality Assurance processes.

 About the Speaker: David is a New York- based member of Syska Hennessy's High Performance Solutions team, with broad perspective and experience as a designer, building science researcher and teacher.  His expertise lies in integrating research, analysis, and design to provide luminous, thermal and acoustic comfort while reducing resource consumption in buildings. In the summer of 2011 David traveled to Japan as part of the Architecture.Energy.2011 workshop to assist architects rebuilding after the natural and nuclear disasters. He spent two years as a student and researcher in the Center for the Built Environment at the University of California Berkeley, and is currently completing his degree. David holds a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and is a registered architect in the State of New York.





Presentation 2 Title: N++: A demonstration of the latest GUI for EnergyPlus; Vladimir Bajic ? Senior Energy Engineer and Software Developer 


Description: N++ is a building energy modeling software created to emulate the architectural and engineering design process. As a front interface for the highly capable EnergyPlus simulation engine, N++ allows the user to input project information into the energy simulation in an intuitive, highly visible fashion that simplifies the energy modeling process for designers who are new to energy analysis. During the presentation Mr. Bajic will demonstrate the construction of an energy model in N++, exemplifying the innovative features that simplify the construction of complex building geometries, lighting designs and mechanical systems. The presentation will also demonstrate the flexible capability of N++ to build multiple parametric runs and produce an energy code baseline quickly and easily.


About the Speaker: Mr. Bajic is a mechanical engineer with over 16 years of experience in the HVAC industry as a designer, energy modeler and software developer. His experience is both international and domestic. Mr.Bajic?s main focus is building software applications that will help architects and engineers design more efficient buildings as part of an integrated design process. Mr. Bajic is currently a senior energy engineer at Viridian Energy & Environmental (a Vidaris company). He is also the founder of the ExpertApp (www.expertapp.com), a software company that is specialized in creating engineering and architectural cad-based applications focused on integrated sustainable design.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] non-refrigerated warehouse roof insulation R-value
Message-ID: <CAJaiD7oTTdn8RipQ=zGrp9tsiAiXNeOH4cFJ4fT-NYje+VD-nQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Are there any existing studies that investigate the relationship between
the roof insulation R-value and energy performance in a non-refrigerated
warehouse/distribution center?

The ASHRAE 90.1 prescriptive baseline is R-20 c.i. and I'm inclined to
believe it is not an envelope dominated building type. In a one story
warehouse that is more than half a million square feet in area, the roof
area can be considerable compared to walls and windows, while the indoor
temperature might be allowed to swing a little more than in other
commercial building types.

Thank you,
Ramana Koti.

Dear Sirs

I made a simulation of two one floor building for offices.
The results indicate the following:
Area / Sypply / Design Capacity
2810 sqft / 3974 cfm / 271cfm/ton
1017 swft / 1306 cfm / 302cfm/ton

Why the software gives these results so differente from the usual rule

Khristiam,

I don't know the exact situation of your building, but here are some things
to consider:  

The CFM supplied to a space is driven by the sensible loads in the space.
The coil capacity, however, is driven by the sensible loads in the space,
the latent loads in the space (moisture from people breathing, for example),
the additional sensible loads on the coil (a fan, for example), and the
additional latent loads on the coil (outdoor air, for example).  

If the only loads on your system were sensible space loads, your CFM/ton
would always be about 545 cfm, based on the sensible heat equation
(generally BTU/hr = 1.1*CFM*(deltaT), assuming the temperature difference
between your room air and your supply air is about 20F.  As you add latent
loads and coil loads, the capacity increases while the CFM remains the same.
As a rule it often comes out to around 400 CFM/ton as you say.  But if you
have a high percentage of latent loads or high coil loads, the capacity will
increase more and the CFM/ton will go down further.  Additionally, if you
have a high deltaT between supply air and room air, you will require lower
CFM to meet the load, and your CFM/ton will again go down.

To summarize, the things I can think of that will give you low CFM/tons are:
--High percentage of latent loads
--High percentage of coil loads
--Lower than normal cooling supply air temperature
--Higher than normal room setpoint temperature

I hope this helps,
Christian
