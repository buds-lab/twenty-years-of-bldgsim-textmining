Subject: [Bldg-sim] DOE-2 Report - PFP VAV- Box Fan power
Message-ID: <CAM04QhfpRrvM4=oshkbjF2giO9=50c2hvAJsxKhX+m3wKmCTiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Group, I'am struggling to find where in the DOE-2 report do I find the
fan power and flow of the PFP VAV box.
Any hints?
I'm am assuming that the power is reported on the "Report SV-A SYSTEM
DESIGN PARAMETERS", on the Column "Fan (kW)". Am I looking on the right
place.
I've marked where I'm looking in the attached image in case I'm not clear.

Thanks in advance.

Best,
Santiago.

LBNL releases EnergyPlusToFMU version 1.0.0.

 

EnergyPlusToFMU is a software package written in Python which allows users
to export the building simulation program EnergyPlus version 8.0 or higher 

 

as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation using the Functional
Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard version 1.0. This FMU can then be imported
into 

 

a variety of simulation programs that support the import of the Functional
Mock-up Interface for co-simulation. This capability allows for instance to
model the envelope 

 

of a building in EnergyPlus, export the model as an FMU, import and link the
model with an HVAC system model developed in a system simulation tool such
as the Modelica environment Dymola.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling 90.1 Baseline Envelope for Existing + Additions
Message-ID: <CAM04QhdUHTnoqgi9GS5XgwG0f-U4XAwOOxf6PvrxZY7Xbc1Ucg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear forum users, I have modelled a project following Appendix G. and have
received a review regarding my interpretation of % glazed area on the
baseline.

The project is a mayor renovations + Additions (existing conditioned
warehouse + New office building attached). There were no modification on %
area of vertical and horizontal glazing on the existing bit of the building.

My approach was to model existing envelope, shape and fenestration, exactly
the same in both proposed and baseline. The addition was modelled following
the "maximum 40% for vertical fenestration and 5% for skylight" rule. The
result of the whole building for baseline is, 28% vertically glazed and 12%
of skylights (the existing bit was very different than 40%, and 5%
respectively)
The reviewer states that the end result for the baseline should still be
40% and 5%. It is not very clear to me how would I get there.. Do I have to
make the existing fenestration proportionally smaller, just like I would do
for the baseline of a completely new building?

Thanks in advance.

Santiago.

Proposed and Baseline areas/layouts matching works perfectly until you exceed either 40% for vertical or 5% for skylights.  See Table G3.1.5, baseline items c. and d.  This might be coincidence, but just to be cover all bases: 28% + 12% = 40% is an incorrect reading - the skylight and vertical fenestration thresholds are independent.

I think you are to leave the vertical fenestrations alone (being under the 40% threshold) and you need to proportionally lower the area of the skylights in the baseline model to get back to 5%.  Proposed model needs to match actual design so it's skylights remain the same.

I'm not certain how or if the project being a major renovation has any bearing on the matter.

Are you making the case that the existing skylights are envelope components not being touched, and so should remain equal in area between the models despite exceeding the 5% threshold?  Do you have additional new skylights complicating the matter?

Nick, thanks for the response. The answer is yes, I'am trying to make a
case for exceeding the 5% threshold for existing bit of the project, which
is not modified.
The project is a big existing conditioned warehouse, with lots of skylights
(18% of roof area), the new bit is an office building, with more skylights
(properly shaded this time!). I thought it would be fare to have a baseline
which maintains the existing bit exactly the same (18% skylights), and the
new addition according to Table G3.1.5 (5%). The global skylight area for
the whole project is *12%*, and this was reviewed.
The opposite happens for vertical fenestration, warehouse has almost no
windows, and the new office is fully glazed. With the same criteria,
existing stays the same, new is 40% max; then the proposed ends up with
global 32% WWR and baseline only 28%. This was reviewed as well.  Am
I explaining my self?

I thought this would be fair, and in fact it made so much sense I thought
it was the only possible interpretation... Its very good to remember one an
be *very* wrong.

So my approach should be:
- For vertical fenestration, 32% both baseline and proposed.
- For the skylights, I would multiple every skylight by  5/12 to get a
global 5% skylight.

 Hmmm....energy savings are going to plummet.
Thank you again Nick.

Santiago.

Santiago,

 

I would reach out to the reviewer and argue that your original
interpretation is correct. Appendix G Table 3.1.5 f that you quoted below
clearly suggests that the baseline building design for renovation projects
shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions. The section covers
all aspects of envelope including thermal and solar properties, assembly
type, and surface area, so there is no indication that the "existing
conditions" mentioned in 3.1.5 f exclude fenestration / skylight area. I
don't see why this rule should be void for projects that include both
renovation and addition. Section G1.3 is also relevant: G1.3 Trade-Off
Limits. When the proposed modifications apply to less than the whole
building, only parameters related to the systems to be modified shall be
allowed to vary. Parameters relating to unmodified existing conditions or to
future building components shall be identical for determining both the
baseline building performance and the proposed building performance. Since
the window/skylight area is not modified, it should produce neither penalty
nor credit for the proposed design. 

 

Maria

Nick, thanks for the response. The answer is yes, I'am trying to make a case
for exceeding the 5% threshold for existing bit of the project, which is not
modified.

The project is a big existing conditioned warehouse, with lots of skylights
(18% of roof area), the new bit is an office building, with more skylights
(properly shaded this time!). I thought it would be fare to have a baseline
which maintains the existing bit exactly the same (18% skylights), and the
new addition according to Table G3.1.5 (5%). The global skylight area for
the whole project is 12%, and this was reviewed. 

The opposite happens for vertical fenestration, warehouse has almost no
windows, and the new office is fully glazed. With the same criteria,
existing stays the same, new is 40% max; then the proposed ends up with
global 32% WWR and baseline only 28%. This was reviewed as well.  Am I
explaining my self?

 

I thought this would be fair, and in fact it made so much sense I thought it
was the only possible interpretation... Its very good to remember one an be
very wrong.

 

So my approach should be: 

- For vertical fenestration, 32% both baseline and proposed. 

- For the skylights, I would multiple every skylight by  5/12 to get a
global 5% skylight. 

 

 Hmmm....energy savings are going to plummet. 

Thank you again Nick.

 

Santiago.

 

2013/11/4 Nick Caton <ncaton at smithboucher.com>

Proposed and Baseline areas/layouts matching works perfectly until you
exceed either 40% for vertical or 5% for skylights.  See Table G3.1.5,
baseline items c. and d.  This might be coincidence, but just to be cover
all bases: 28% + 12% = 40% is an incorrect reading - the skylight and
vertical fenestration thresholds are independent.

 

I think you are to leave the vertical fenestrations alone (being under the
40% threshold) and you need to proportionally lower the area of the
skylights in the baseline model to get back to 5%.  Proposed model needs to
match actual design so it's skylights remain the same.

 

I'm not certain how or if the project being a major renovation has any
bearing on the matter.  

 

Are you making the case that the existing skylights are envelope components
not being touched, and so should remain equal in area between the models
despite exceeding the 5% threshold?  Do you have additional new skylights
complicating the matter?

Dear forum users, I have modelled a project following Appendix G. and have
received a review regarding my interpretation of % glazed area on the
baseline.


The project is a mayor renovations + Additions (existing conditioned
warehouse + New office building attached). There were no modification on %
area of vertical and horizontal glazing on the existing bit of the building.

My approach was to model existing envelope, shape and fenestration, exactly
the same in both proposed and baseline. The addition was modelled following
the "maximum 40% for vertical fenestration and 5% for skylight" rule. The
result of the whole building for baseline is, 28% vertically glazed and 12%
of skylights (the existing bit was very different than 40%, and 5%
respectively)
The reviewer states that the end result for the baseline should still be 40%
and 5%. It is not very clear to me how would I get there.. Do I have to make
the existing fenestration proportionally smaller, just like I would do for
the baseline of a completely new building?

Thanks in advance.

Santiago.

Maria thanks for sharing your opinion. I will reach out to the reviewer.
 It's good to know there can be different interpretation. I do understand
that if you are certifying as "New construction and Mayor renovations" it
might make sense that you need demonstrating savings against the full new
Baseline defined by Appendix G.  It would be nice if future editions of the
standard were more clear about this and other issues that seem to fall in
grey areas.

Thanks.
Santiago.

I also agree with Maria's input.  When existing conditions are known, those should supercede the baseline requirements set up for to address new construction.

I've experienced a grouping of major renovation LEED projects where the reviewer in fact pushed me to document and model actual existing opaque envelope constructions instead of the standard baseline constructions, which actually boosted the performance ratings quite a bit.  This was simple on my part as I already had the needed information worked into my proposed model.

In making your case with your reviewer ahead of time (which I'd reinforce as sound advice) and for your model documentation moving forward, I advise clearly and separately documenting the area totals for skylights and roof areas between the existing/untouched portions of the building and the new areas of the building.  As you originally posed the question to the lists, we had to speculate in that direction.

The project is a mayor renovations + Additions (existing conditioned warehouse + New office building attached). There were no modification on % area of vertical and horizontal glazing on the existing bit of the building.

My approach was to model existing envelope, shape and fenestration, exactly the same in both proposed and baseline. The addition was modelled following the "maximum 40% for vertical fenestration and 5% for skylight" rule. The result of the whole building for baseline is, 28% vertically glazed and 12% of skylights (the existing bit was very different than 40%, and 5% respectively)
The reviewer states that the end result for the baseline should still be 40% and 5%. It is not very clear to me how would I get there.. Do I have to make the existing fenestration proportionally smaller, just like I would do for the baseline of a completely new building?

Thanks in advance.

Santiago.

The baseline guidelines might both still apply though, let me throw this interpretation out there. Either way, you should ask for clarification on your proposed path before submitting if possible.


1.       Model the existing as-is per the reference that you noted. Seems straightforward.

2.       Whole-building totals might still be required to match the 40% and 5%, unless superseded by #1. This seems to be the point of discussion with the reviewer.

In that case the baseline total glazing for the existing portion would be modeled as existing. The new construction baseline would have any remainder of glazing area up to 40%. It sounded like you would be below 40% total, so model as you did before with the basline = proposed.

For skylights the existing building "consumes" more than 5% of the whole project, therefore the skylight area would be capped at whatever the actual percentage is based on the existing. The baseline would not have skylights in the new construction unless they were required to be added by some other part of the code or local requirements in order to meeet the 5% requirement. This could benefit you if the project is adding photocell control of the lighting in the new addition in conjunction with the skylights.

G1.3 is tricky since there is also a new portion to the project that can still impact the overall percentages, even if the existing portion is modeled as-is. And none of the complex is excluded from the renovation, although the envelope may not be changing. Assuming that lighting, HVAC, and interiors are being renovated in the existing warehouse? Otherwise your LEED project boundary should only be the new addition.

Maria thanks for sharing your opinion. I will reach out to the reviewer.  It's good to know there can be different interpretation. I do understand that if you are certifying as "New construction and Mayor renovations" it might make sense that you need demonstrating savings against the full new Baseline defined by Appendix G.  It would be nice if future editions of the standard were more clear about this and other issues that seem to fall in grey areas.

Thanks.

Santiago,

I would reach out to the reviewer and argue that your original interpretation is correct. Appendix G Table 3.1.5 f that you quoted below clearly suggests that the baseline building design for renovation projects shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions. The section covers all aspects of envelope including thermal and solar properties, assembly type, and surface area, so there is no indication that the "existing conditions" mentioned in 3.1.5 f exclude fenestration / skylight area. I don't see why this rule should be void for projects that include both renovation and addition. Section G1.3 is also relevant: G1.3 Trade-Off Limits. When the proposed modifications apply to less than the whole building, only parameters related to the systems to be modified shall be allowed to vary. Parameters relating to unmodified existing conditions or to future building components shall be identical for determining both the baseline building performance and the proposed building performance. Since the window/skylight area is not modified, it should produce neither penalty nor credit for the proposed design.

Maria

2013/11/4 Santiago Velez <santiagogvelez at gmail.com<mailto:santiagogvelez at gmail.com>>
Nick, thanks for the response. The answer is yes, I'am trying to make a case for exceeding the 5% threshold for existing bit of the project, which is not modified.
The project is a big existing conditioned warehouse, with lots of skylights (18% of roof area), the new bit is an office building, with more skylights (properly shaded this time!). I thought it would be fare to have a baseline which maintains the existing bit exactly the same (18% skylights), and the new addition according to Table G3.1.5 (5%). The global skylight area for the whole project is 12%, and this was reviewed.
The opposite happens for vertical fenestration, warehouse has almost no windows, and the new office is fully glazed. With the same criteria, existing stays the same, new is 40% max; then the proposed ends up with global 32% WWR and baseline only 28%. This was reviewed as well.  Am I explaining my self?

I thought this would be fair, and in fact it made so much sense I thought it was the only possible interpretation... Its very good to remember one an be very wrong.

So my approach should be:
- For vertical fenestration, 32% both baseline and proposed.
- For the skylights, I would multiple every skylight by  5/12 to get a global 5% skylight.

 Hmmm....energy savings are going to plummet.
Thank you again Nick.

Santiago.

Proposed and Baseline areas/layouts matching works perfectly until you exceed either 40% for vertical or 5% for skylights.  See Table G3.1.5, baseline items c. and d.  This might be coincidence, but just to be cover all bases: 28% + 12% = 40% is an incorrect reading - the skylight and vertical fenestration thresholds are independent.

I think you are to leave the vertical fenestrations alone (being under the 40% threshold) and you need to proportionally lower the area of the skylights in the baseline model to get back to 5%.  Proposed model needs to match actual design so it's skylights remain the same.

I'm not certain how or if the project being a major renovation has any bearing on the matter.

Are you making the case that the existing skylights are envelope components not being touched, and so should remain equal in area between the models despite exceeding the 5% threshold?  Do you have additional new skylights complicating the matter?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling 90.1 Baseline Envelope for Existing + Additions

Dear forum users, I have modelled a project following Appendix G. and have received a review regarding my interpretation of % glazed area on the baseline.

The project is a mayor renovations + Additions (existing conditioned warehouse + New office building attached). There were no modification on % area of vertical and horizontal glazing on the existing bit of the building.

My approach was to model existing envelope, shape and fenestration, exactly the same in both proposed and baseline. The addition was modelled following the "maximum 40% for vertical fenestration and 5% for skylight" rule. The result of the whole building for baseline is, 28% vertically glazed and 12% of skylights (the existing bit was very different than 40%, and 5% respectively)
The reviewer states that the end result for the baseline should still be 40% and 5%. It is not very clear to me how would I get there.. Do I have to make the existing fenestration proportionally smaller, just like I would do for the baseline of a completely new building?

Thanks in advance.

Santiago.

David, exactly, that is another way to go. Even if I decide to maintain 40%
and 5% thresholds, there are some different ways of getting there,
considering the mixed existing + addition issue. This is why I agree
requesting some feedback is the way to go.
The existing warehouse was included because is part of the LEED scope and
because it doesn't meet *Table G3.1.2  Additions and alteration to exclude
existing building  "c. Design space temperature and HVAC system operating
setpoints and schedules on either side of the boundary between included and
excluded parts of the building are essentially the same."*

Some renovation is happening in the existing bit, lightings is fully
replaced to LED and roof insulation is added. Shading for skylights was
suggested and opted out by the client for various reasons during design. In
the project's weather, 3A, insulations is not as big of an issue as solar
radiation control. So worst case scenario, shading those skylights might be
simple solution to be close to the savings the project was aiming. On the
other hand It is never nice to tell a client you have to add something to
the project once construction has finished, so its worth defending our
approach and our clients interests with reviewers.

Santiago.

Message-ID: <770DA51B8CC79343A32830010D6E379A260C57AA@PC3XMB-0002L.LEC-ADMIN.dmu.ac.uk>

Hi all,

The preview version of jEPlus v1.5 has been made available on SourceForge. There are two key new features: an E+ IDF version converter GUI, and the GUI for executing Python scripts. The version converter tool scans a folder for files to convert, and it doesn?t rely on the version information in the IDF files, which can be a bother when you have many IDF snippets. Here is a short video tutorial demonstrating its use: http://youtu.be/RUDpmdkYI_g.

The Python runner tool has more symbolic significance than its functions at the moment. We have started learning Python and found it THE solution to our old post-processing/visualization problem after getting loads of parametric results. The idea is that users can write and share Python scripts, which will extend the functionality of the toolkit. But since we are still learning, there aren?t many examples we can show.

jEPlus v1.5 also offers experimental support for INSEL, although I am not sure how many INSEL users are here?

Best regards,

Yi

Dear Juan,
I am not an EE$ user, but the approach below is one I used in EnergyPlus before it could model VRF.  It may help you...

*         VRF with heat recovery:  A water source heat pump system does exactly the same functions as heat recovery VRF systems, but uses different equipment.  To model the VRF:
o   Assign fan power to match the VRF fan power
o   We'll want all of the actual power use to be reflected at the System level, not zone level, so define the WSHP compressor with a COP of 10,000.  That results in compressor power = load.
o   The WSHP plant loop will have a Boiler and Chiller, and only one or the other will operate to meet the loop needs, just like VRF.  Since neither of these have part load performance similar to the VRF outdoor unit, we want to make their energy use reflect loads only, and that requires boiler efficiency = 1.00 and chiller COP = 10,000.  (Note: This could also be accomplished using District heating and cooling)
o   After reporting the energy use for the boiler and chiller using  Meter:Custom, apply the proper VRF part load factors in a post-process calculation.

Hi Juan,

It is pretty tough to simulate VRF in EE4 unless you take some workaround
by modifying Doe file and export hourly results. Post processing is
necessary.

I strongly suggest that you should use Energypro (the same developer of EE4
if I am not wrong). Check this out

Subject: [Bldg-sim]  VRF in EE4 workaround questions
Message-ID: <CAOKTROahhf-EF+BHWV0vtC220my1JkXAmHtBqi42m6fJocqaNg@mail.gmail.com>

HI again,

I'm trying to model a VRF system using an infinitely efficient heat pump
(so as to bring the cooling/heating loads to the systems level and then
adjust with part-load performance at a post-processing stage).

The problem with this approach is that the heat pump units are using the
compressors even when they are just transferring heat within the loop
without input from the central plant, while the VRF system recovers heat
without any power input. Would using a COP of 10,000 take care of this as
this would result in an infinitely efficient compressor? How will the
condenser energy consumption be incorporated?


Thanks again,

Sebastian

Juan,
It's been a while I haven't used EE4 but I remember there was a limit on the COP that you can use. No matter what you enter, the COP in EE4 is limited to 8 I believe.
You need to do some tests or check your .doe file for the EIR (1/COP) value.

Hello All,
I am using Energy Plus software to analyse a building located in Barcelona,
Spain. In the LEED report it is indicating the Electric Demand for space
cooling & Interior Lighting is zero, is it possible?
I have tried many times to solve this but unable to do so, please suggest

I am also having a similar problem for an office building in Ohio using eQuest.  The annual peak demand by end use report shows zero demand for cooling, yet there is the expected amount of space cooling in the monthly peak demand by end use and the expected amount of space cooling consumption kWh usage.  Everything else seems to be in order....

Could this be an eQuest glitch?

You have already decided that it is impossible for a working HVAC and lighting system to have zero demand.  Have you confirmed that these systems are actually operating? i.e., is there energy consumption?  If not, check schedules to make sure the systems turn on or (for HVAC) check setpoints to confirm that there is a demand.
If energy is consumed, but demand is not shown, you probably want to send the file to the E+ Help Desk. (I'm not sure how eQuest users get help :()

Best bet for eQuest-specific help is usually the [Equest-users] archives and the mailing list community, and there's an E+ counterpart mailing list as well.   That said a substantial amount of eQuest-specific and E+-specific queries are handled here as well on [Bldg-sim] - sometimes it's not always clear when a question is specific to software or more general in nature so the the [bldg-sim] serves as an effective catch-all.

To Tom's eQuest query (and I'm speaking specifically to eQuest - E+ users will have to confirm if any of this applies on your end):
It's important to recognize that monthly and annual "peak demand" values reported in most detailed/graphical reports do not strictly represent the maximum draw of each end-use - they represent the hour with the maximum draw on the associated meter, broken out by end-use through that hour.

By extension, your cooling system(s) can be operating normally and keeping the spaces cool when called for, but not be operating within the hour of maximum draw for each month or for the year.  This is not uncommon in the winter months for temperate and heating-dominated climates, particularly when there's substantial electric heating in play to overwhelm what the cooling systems require.

So that said, the graphical "Annual peak demand by end use" report is if I'm not mistaken reporting enduse draws for the peak hour over the whole simulated year - not seeing cooling in this pie chart is simply indicative of more substantial heating operating under the same meter.  You can review and confirm if and when cooling plays a part in your monthly peak demands by reviewing the monthly graphical charts or via the PS-E/PS-F detailed reports.

Have you all looked at your hourly output to see what's going on there?
That always seems like a prudent first step in model debugging. I look at
hourly output from all models. That gets you closer to the root of the
problem, rather than looking at a particular report that you might or might
not understand.

Message-ID: <1814910251.20527.1384341996011.open-xchange@app02.ox.hosteurope.de>

Dear group,

I've recently released version 0.19 of a free Rhino/Grasshopper3d plugin,
written in Python, that allows you to spatially map e+ zone report variables in
design/visualization models- no matter what e+ sim tool the data came from
(readvarseso gen'd csv files are your friend).

It's been tested in a class here at the TU Berlin a bit already ( see the blog:
http://mrcomfy.org/?p=452 | http://mrcomfy.org/?p=481 ), went through some
update cycles and I think it's now useful enough to warrant me sharing it with
you- have a look at http://mrcomfy.org - full documentation is available there.

This is, of course, not a super new idea, but the precedents I could unearth are
either not openly available or do things slighty different, e.g. OpenStudio's
zone color coding. I'd be nonetheless grateful if you could point me to other
published precedents should they spontaneously occurr to you, since I'll do a
writeup of the method and would like to give credit where it's due.

All the best,

Max

PS I've been lurking on this list with another eMail address for ~6 years; it
feels strange to suddenly be contributing something, huh, tangible.

 Construction Evaluation Protocol

Dear Energy Simulation Professionals:
I wanted to make you were aware of the public comment period that opened up yesterday for a specific DOE Uniform Methods Project (UMP) measure - "Commercial New Construction Evaluation Protocol". See http://ump.pnnl.gov/forum.php for the comment site.  The main site for the UMP is here: https://www1.eere.energy.gov/office_eere/de_ump.html


Per the protocol description - "This protocol describes  best practices for evaluating "whole building performance" new construction projects in the commercial sector. The focus is on measures (or packages of measures) whose impacts are best evaluated using building simulation." The protocol describes a savings verification workflow adherent to IPMVP Option D, including descriptions of data requirements and collection methods. In addition, the protocol introduces (5) new terms for different (evolving) models used in new construction design assistance. And much more.
If you work on new construction energy models of commercial buildings that need to claim 'verified savings' over a baseline for some purpose (utility program incentives, LEED certification, etc.), I encourage you to read and comment on this proposed protocol. While guised as a protocol (not a standard), if not harmonized with existing protocols and evolving standards it may end up creating confusion in the marketplace than necessary.

At any rate, the comment period for this remains open until December 20th.

All the Best,

_Chris

Hi all,

I wonder whether I could find FWT or EPW weather files for Istanbul Turkey
that I can use for VE IES Radiance simulation.  Any suggestions would be
appreciated.

Thank you

If you're using the weather file with IES Radiance, you should make sure that the weather 
file contains Daylight Illuminances (Global, Direct Normal, Diffuse,Zenith, etc.), and not 
just the Solar Radiation, which indicates the amount of heat rather than light. Both of 
the two following weather files contain illuminance data, albeit they're all calculated:

There is an old ASHRAE IWEC weather file for Istanbul (circa 2001) in EPW format that can 
be downloaded for free from the EnergyPlus Weather web site.

There is  a new ASHRAE IWEC2 weather file for Istanbul (circa 2010) that is available at 
my Web site, but it is not free.  IWEC2 weather files are based on recorded weather 
station data for 12 to 25 years, and available for 3,012 locations outside the US and Canada.

For more info on  purchasing individual IWEC2 weather files, please go to

Roger the huge challenge.  Bear in mind that the project won't want to 
pay any more no matter how many things they change and the profession 
quickly becomes a losing proposition.

Dear all,

We are a group of students working on an academic project, regarding energy

I think you're much better off getting the weather data for the nearest location in Puerto 
Rico, than some generic site with similar weather (how would you know that it's similar, 
anyway?).  There are 6-7 weather stations in Puerto Rico in the TMY3 weather data set, of 
which the closest to El Yunque is Roosevelt-Roads 16 km to the east, but on the coast.  
The other alternative is a station called Palmer 16 kilometer to the north, for which 
Weather Underground seems to have data (search www.wunderground.com).  However, converting 
Weather Underground weather data to usable files for EnergyPlus simulations would take 
some effort.  I've done that twice, and it could easily take a day or two of work.

I assume that you're concerned with the microclimate differences between the rain forest 
and the nearby locations.  I think you can only get those if there is a weather station 
within the rain forest.  I frankly don't think you can reliably get such the microclimatic 
differences using modeled weather data, except for possibly adiabatic expansion 
(temperature depression) due to differences in elevation. Having said that, it's also easy 
to do the same adiabatic correction using measured data. Unless you find hourly measured 
data from the rain forest itself, my recommendation would be to use Roosevelt-Roads TMY3 
and correct for the elevation if you're so interested.

Depends on what you mean by ?successfully?  As far as the OS is concerned, yes, it runs fine under Windows 8.1.  I did get a fatal error in the GLASS category when running a simple 2-story office building with the default properties.  So, not a total success!

But, Win 8.1 seems to be healthy.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] natural ventilation scenario and LEED
Message-ID: <004c01cee716$f1cd8d80$d568a880$@naturalintelligence.us>

I have a factory/warehouse that is using natural ventilation for cooling. What is unusual is that the openings are fixed openings.

 

At first glance it seems that it would not even qualify as an enclosed space and therefore would not be eligible for energy modeling for LEED. The project is registered at USGBC however, of course I realize that may mean nothing.

 

If this project could be eligible for LEED certification, I am trying to come up with an approach and all I can think of is pretending the openings are operable and then following the guidelines as outlined in the Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED handbook.

 

I would appreciate any guidance anyone can offer on this seeming conundrum!

We are modelling a retail store with cold rooms. The manufacturer claims to have installed high efficient refrigeration units than a commonly used equipment. The project is going for rating under commercial interior. Please let me know the baseline to model the refrigeration units and the methodology to model. Also is it possible to claim savings for refrigeration units for commercial interior projects. (Only savings from HVAC can be accounted in CI rating)?.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1 system type in maintenance garage / office
Message-ID: <B7FE24EB2E85FD47B9EB4A8DA59E76EFB4383FFE71@TREXCHMAIL.corp.tridel.com>

All,

A (hopefully) simple ASHRAE 90.1 baseline system question.

I have a building which is part office, part maintenance/storage garage.  The garage/maintenance portion is about ? of the total GFA.  Appendix G system type is #5 - Packaged VAV w RH.  However, I want to apply G3.1.1c as an exception, which states that system 3 or 4 should be used for zones which have special pressurization relationships, cross contamination requirements or code-required airflow rates. This is definitely the case.

My question is do I use system 3 or 4 for the garage/maintenance zones (both the predominant condition and the zones with the special requirements) or the office zones?  The wording leads me to believe its actual the office zones which need to be system type 3, but this seems backwards, and it's essentially the reverse of what is installed, which is VAV in the office, PSZ in the garage.

Regards,

Adam

On a recent LEED project I received a review comment that stated:

"The exception [it was exception G3.1.1b in my case] should be applied to lesser portion of building served by the system." The reviewer's interpretation was that the primary system selection applied to the LARGER BY AREA portion of the project, and the break-out system per the exception goes to the lessor by area portion of the project, which in your case sounds like you would end-up with a bizzaro switch on system types between the baseline and proposed model.

I guess this is just another one of those examples to file away when you end up with outlandish baseline systems per the Appendix G prescribed methodology that seems counter-intuitive.

You both may get additional answers by posting your questions to the 
LEEDuser.com since these are mostly LEED questions.

For the nat. ventilation question: Is there any mechanical equipment at 
all in the building? It is my understanding that you can model the HVAC 
that you have in order to submit to LEED. If not, I think you'll need to 
share more information about the building's geometry to get an answer. 
Being registered as a LEED project means nothing as far as it qualifying 
as an eligible project. Also, you can't model operable openings that 
don't exist. Sorry!

For the cold rooms question: refrigeration is a process load and all 
process loads must be modeled the same in the baseline and proposed 
cases, unfortunately. The only advantage you get from more efficient 
process loads is less "noise" in the overall model which helps in your 
overall percentage of energy savings.

Jill,
It seems you may be mis-understand the questions-- also the normal policy
of the list is to respond to individual posts on their own so that other
people who may have other ideas about the subject then yourself can reply.

With regards to fixed window natural ventilation: Christian who posed the
natural ventilation question has most likely completed more LEED projects
then most people on the list, surly he knows about LEED user and also knows
that there are countless loopholes in and interpretations of ASHRAE 90.1,
especially for natural ventilation a subject that is loosely defined by the
so called rules.  I would suggest to use the design builder external CFD
module to demonstrate your concept. I think that it sounds like a situation
of a semi heated space,  and that you may be able to make a case for the
same in the baseline as proposed if this an existing building and this is
the the condition of the building envelope before renovation-- if it is a
new building then the design could be changed to be acceptable by the
standards of 90.1 if necessary.

With regards to cold rooms; you could use the Energy Plus walk in
refrigerator objects to model them, and could do an exceptional calculation
to claim the energy saving benefits.

Rathna,

For commercial refrigeration baseline details take a look at the Technical Guide Book 2012 by Alliant Energy. http://www.alliantenergy.com/wcm/groups/wcm_internet/@int/documents/document/mdaw/mdiz/~edisp/023759.pdf

Table 43 on p. 128 lists characteristics of new construction baseline systems, although it does not give a baseline efficiency for compressors. There is an equation to estimate compressor efficiency on p. 125, but the paragraph underneath states ?This equation should not be used to determine baseline compressor efficiency.?

For insulation of cold storage rooms take a look at Table 2 (p. 50) of ASHRAE?s Design Essentials for Refrigerated Storage Facilities.

NREL has been working on a document identifying commercial refrigeration baselines, including compressor efficiency, but I don?t think it has been published yet.

I?m not certain about the LEED rules since I don?t do many LEED models, but I believe you can take credit for reducing process loads using an exceptional calculation and documenting your justification for claiming the savings. I suspect that you will need to do an exceptional calculation anyway because some modeling programs won?t allow the thermostat settings to go as low the cold rooms will be.

Sincerely,

Dear all,

We are modelling a retail store with cold rooms. The manufacturer claims to have installed high efficient refrigeration units than a commonly used equipment. The project is going for rating under commercial interior. Please let me know the baseline to model the refrigeration units and the methodology to model. Also is it possible to claim savings for refrigeration units for commercial interior projects. (Only savings from HVAC can be accounted in CI rating)?.

 Crist?an, defining thermal blocks for energy modelling can be tricky
sometimes and there is always many 'right' answers. It also depends on what
you are trying to demonstrate with your model. In this case,I'm having
trouble to understand what is happening in there. There might be some
issues with other Acad Referenced files... All I see is a floorplan with
what looks like the the outline of the building's envelope. With only this
info, IMO, is not enough to determine the 'correct' thermal block for LEED
Core&Shell. I would  be happy to meet you on skype and give you hand since
we are from the same part of the world (i.e. South America).

Best,
Santiago.

All,
A number of professionals in the Dallas/Fort Worth area are putting together a new IBPSA-USA chapter.  We have about a dozen participants so far but are still looking for more members.  Anyone involved in building energy and thermal modeling is welcome to participate.  Membership is for those local to Collin, Dallas, Denton or Tarrant counties but we're willing to extend that to others in the North Texas area if they're willing to attend meetings in the metro area.  No meeting venue has been identified yet.  We will try to find a centrally located one or rotate venues at our places of business.  Student members from schools like SMU, TCU, UNT, UTA, UTD, etc. are welcome.  So if you are a local modeler and would like to participate, please get in touch.  Information on IBPSA-USA membership can be found here<http://www.ibpsa.us/membership.shtml>.  Thanks,

Dear all,

We are evaluating a technology for energy recuperation and would therefore
do a thermodynamic analysis of the potential applications. Data centers is
one field of interest ...
Therefore, I am looking for some data on inlet and outlet temperatures and
flow rates of data centers of different sizes.

Just the temperatures and flow rates is sufficient at this stage. However
information on the temperature fluctuation (amplitude and frequency) might
be relevant as well.

Thanks a lot!

Dear all,

We are working on a project that has a special occupancy space and we need
to determine a setback/setup temperature for moments that the space is not
occupied during working hours.

Section 6.4.3.3.2, of ASHRAE 90.1, states that setback temperature must be
13?C or lower, and setup temperature, 32?C or higher. I understand these
temperatures are for off-hours.

Are there such limits of setback/setup temperature for working hours? Or is
it defined by design?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments
Message-ID: <CAPAgWcytjqd1r6NjfUW83w1BGJ=fg1=+kCmy8LMezzK6jw3pAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm modelling a mixed office/residential tower building with 160 apartments
in tropical climate, for LEED. The apartments are centrally cooled with fan
coil units, in the living room and bedrooms. The design team sized the
chiller with a diversity of 0.5, probably assuming that when the occupants
are in the living room, they're not cooling the bedrooms or something of
the sort.

Given the number of apartments, I modelled each apartment as a single
block. I cannot use zone multipliers because of the specific geometry of
the building. I have one combined FCU for each apartment, which is of
course either on or off. I'm also grouping apartments based on orientation,
but that's beside the point.

My question is about an approach to modelling the diversity of use of FCUs
in the apartments. With my modelling simplification, I cannot model the
diversity of cooling within an apartment. So what would be an acceptable
approach?

I can only think of turning cooling off in half of the apartments, though
apartments with cooling turned off are occupied and have internal loads.
Would a LEED reviewer be ok with such an approach. Or is there a better way?

Thanks,
Patrick

*         View results graphically or in a grid.

*         Export results for further analysis in a spreadsheet.

*         View tabular results held in .htm files and associate the tabular results with an .eso dataset.

*         Select the time interval from Monthly, Daily, Hourly and Timestep - depending on the data in the .eso file.

*         Available reports are listed for the selected time interval and can be selected for viewing.

*         A crosshair option allows you to display numeric values for all displayed data series for any point in time.

*         Show multiple graphs on the screen at once.

*         Include multiple Y-axes on each graph as required by the selected reports.

*         When viewing datasets for long simulation periods the zoom function allows you to focus in on shorter time per iods.

*         Sort the list of available outputs by Area or Report type

*         Store all session data and settings in a single compact file for ease of storage and communication. Session files can be emailed to colleagues and easily opened to see precisely the same results as the sender.

*         Associate the .eso extension with the Results Viewer allowing easy integration with EPLaunch and other EnergyPlus GUIs.

Message-ID: <CAM04QhfpRrvM4=oshkbjF2giO9=50c2hvAJsxKhX+m3wKmCTiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Group, I'am struggling to find where in the DOE-2 report do I find the
fan power and flow of the PFP VAV box.
Any hints?
I'm am assuming that the power is reported on the "Report SV-A SYSTEM
DESIGN PARAMETERS", on the Column "Fan (kW)". Am I looking on the right
place.
I've marked where I'm looking in the attached image in case I'm not clear.

Thanks in advance.

Best,
Santiago.

LBNL releases EnergyPlusToFMU version 1.0.0.

 

EnergyPlusToFMU is a software package written in Python which allows users
to export the building simulation program EnergyPlus version 8.0 or higher 

 

as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation using the Functional
Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard version 1.0. This FMU can then be imported
into 

 

a variety of simulation programs that support the import of the Functional
Mock-up Interface for co-simulation. This capability allows for instance to
model the envelope 

 

of a building in EnergyPlus, export the model as an FMU, import and link the
model with an HVAC system model developed in a system simulation tool such
as the Modelica environment Dymola.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling 90.1 Baseline Envelope for Existing + Additions
Message-ID: <CAM04QhdUHTnoqgi9GS5XgwG0f-U4XAwOOxf6PvrxZY7Xbc1Ucg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear forum users, I have modelled a project following Appendix G. and have
received a review regarding my interpretation of % glazed area on the
baseline.

The project is a mayor renovations + Additions (existing conditioned
warehouse + New office building attached). There were no modification on %
area of vertical and horizontal glazing on the existing bit of the building.

My approach was to model existing envelope, shape and fenestration, exactly
the same in both proposed and baseline. The addition was modelled following
the "maximum 40% for vertical fenestration and 5% for skylight" rule. The
result of the whole building for baseline is, 28% vertically glazed and 12%
of skylights (the existing bit was very different than 40%, and 5%
respectively)
The reviewer states that the end result for the baseline should still be
40% and 5%. It is not very clear to me how would I get there.. Do I have to
make the existing fenestration proportionally smaller, just like I would do
for the baseline of a completely new building?

Thanks in advance.

Santiago.

Proposed and Baseline areas/layouts matching works perfectly until you exceed either 40% for vertical or 5% for skylights.  See Table G3.1.5, baseline items c. and d.  This might be coincidence, but just to be cover all bases: 28% + 12% = 40% is an incorrect reading - the skylight and vertical fenestration thresholds are independent.

I think you are to leave the vertical fenestrations alone (being under the 40% threshold) and you need to proportionally lower the area of the skylights in the baseline model to get back to 5%.  Proposed model needs to match actual design so it's skylights remain the same.

I'm not certain how or if the project being a major renovation has any bearing on the matter.

Are you making the case that the existing skylights are envelope components not being touched, and so should remain equal in area between the models despite exceeding the 5% threshold?  Do you have additional new skylights complicating the matter?

Nick, thanks for the response. The answer is yes, I'am trying to make a
case for exceeding the 5% threshold for existing bit of the project, which
is not modified.
The project is a big existing conditioned warehouse, with lots of skylights
(18% of roof area), the new bit is an office building, with more skylights
(properly shaded this time!). I thought it would be fare to have a baseline
which maintains the existing bit exactly the same (18% skylights), and the
new addition according to Table G3.1.5 (5%). The global skylight area for
the whole project is *12%*, and this was reviewed.
The opposite happens for vertical fenestration, warehouse has almost no
windows, and the new office is fully glazed. With the same criteria,
existing stays the same, new is 40% max; then the proposed ends up with
global 32% WWR and baseline only 28%. This was reviewed as well.  Am
I explaining my self?

I thought this would be fair, and in fact it made so much sense I thought
it was the only possible interpretation... Its very good to remember one an
be *very* wrong.

So my approach should be:
- For vertical fenestration, 32% both baseline and proposed.
- For the skylights, I would multiple every skylight by  5/12 to get a
global 5% skylight.

 Hmmm....energy savings are going to plummet.
Thank you again Nick.

Santiago.

Santiago,

 

I would reach out to the reviewer and argue that your original
interpretation is correct. Appendix G Table 3.1.5 f that you quoted below
clearly suggests that the baseline building design for renovation projects
shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions. The section covers
all aspects of envelope including thermal and solar properties, assembly
type, and surface area, so there is no indication that the "existing
conditions" mentioned in 3.1.5 f exclude fenestration / skylight area. I
don't see why this rule should be void for projects that include both
renovation and addition. Section G1.3 is also relevant: G1.3 Trade-Off
Limits. When the proposed modifications apply to less than the whole
building, only parameters related to the systems to be modified shall be
allowed to vary. Parameters relating to unmodified existing conditions or to
future building components shall be identical for determining both the
baseline building performance and the proposed building performance. Since
the window/skylight area is not modified, it should produce neither penalty
nor credit for the proposed design. 

 

Maria

Nick, thanks for the response. The answer is yes, I'am trying to make a case
for exceeding the 5% threshold for existing bit of the project, which is not
modified.

The project is a big existing conditioned warehouse, with lots of skylights
(18% of roof area), the new bit is an office building, with more skylights
(properly shaded this time!). I thought it would be fare to have a baseline
which maintains the existing bit exactly the same (18% skylights), and the
new addition according to Table G3.1.5 (5%). The global skylight area for
the whole project is 12%, and this was reviewed. 

The opposite happens for vertical fenestration, warehouse has almost no
windows, and the new office is fully glazed. With the same criteria,
existing stays the same, new is 40% max; then the proposed ends up with
global 32% WWR and baseline only 28%. This was reviewed as well.  Am I
explaining my self?

 

I thought this would be fair, and in fact it made so much sense I thought it
was the only possible interpretation... Its very good to remember one an be
very wrong.

 

So my approach should be: 

- For vertical fenestration, 32% both baseline and proposed. 

- For the skylights, I would multiple every skylight by  5/12 to get a
global 5% skylight. 

 

 Hmmm....energy savings are going to plummet. 

Thank you again Nick.

 

Santiago.

Proposed and Baseline areas/layouts matching works perfectly until you
exceed either 40% for vertical or 5% for skylights.  See Table G3.1.5,
baseline items c. and d.  This might be coincidence, but just to be cover
all bases: 28% + 12% = 40% is an incorrect reading - the skylight and
vertical fenestration thresholds are independent.

 

I think you are to leave the vertical fenestrations alone (being under the
40% threshold) and you need to proportionally lower the area of the
skylights in the baseline model to get back to 5%.  Proposed model needs to
match actual design so it's skylights remain the same.

 

I'm not certain how or if the project being a major renovation has any
bearing on the matter.  

 

Are you making the case that the existing skylights are envelope components
not being touched, and so should remain equal in area between the models
despite exceeding the 5% threshold?  Do you have additional new skylights
complicating the matter?

Dear forum users, I have modelled a project following Appendix G. and have
received a review regarding my interpretation of % glazed area on the
baseline.


The project is a mayor renovations + Additions (existing conditioned
warehouse + New office building attached). There were no modification on %
area of vertical and horizontal glazing on the existing bit of the building.

My approach was to model existing envelope, shape and fenestration, exactly
the same in both proposed and baseline. The addition was modelled following
the "maximum 40% for vertical fenestration and 5% for skylight" rule. The
result of the whole building for baseline is, 28% vertically glazed and 12%
of skylights (the existing bit was very different than 40%, and 5%
respectively)
The reviewer states that the end result for the baseline should still be 40%
and 5%. It is not very clear to me how would I get there.. Do I have to make
the existing fenestration proportionally smaller, just like I would do for
the baseline of a completely new building?

Thanks in advance.

Santiago.

I am an undergraduate student in Architectural Technology at Tsinghua

universities that treat building performance challenges from a balanced
design-engineering perspective?. I am particularly interested in programs
that offer advanced building simulation subjects
(e.g. EnergyPlus,  Modelica) in a mix of high performance building design
and HVAC systems courses. Any pointers to existing programs would be
appreciated?.

Maria thanks for sharing your opinion. I will reach out to the reviewer.
 It's good to know there can be different interpretation. I do understand
that if you are certifying as "New construction and Mayor renovations" it
might make sense that you need demonstrating savings against the full new
Baseline defined by Appendix G.  It would be nice if future editions of the
standard were more clear about this and other issues that seem to fall in
grey areas.

Thanks.
Santiago.

I also agree with Maria's input.  When existing conditions are known, those should supercede the baseline requirements set up for to address new construction.

I've experienced a grouping of major renovation LEED projects where the reviewer in fact pushed me to document and model actual existing opaque envelope constructions instead of the standard baseline constructions, which actually boosted the performance ratings quite a bit.  This was simple on my part as I already had the needed information worked into my proposed model.

In making your case with your reviewer ahead of time (which I'd reinforce as sound advice) and for your model documentation moving forward, I advise clearly and separately documenting the area totals for skylights and roof areas between the existing/untouched portions of the building and the new areas of the building.  As you originally posed the question to the lists, we had to speculate in that direction.

The opposite happens for vertical fenestration, warehouse has almost no windows, and the new office is fully glazed. With the same criteria, existing stays the same, new is 40% max; then the proposed ends up with global 32% WWR and baseline only 28%. This was reviewed as well.  Am I explaining my self?

I thought this would be fair, and in fact it made so much sense I thought it was the only possible interpretation... Its very good to remember one an be very wrong.

So my approach should be:
- For vertical fenestration, 32% both baseline and proposed.
- For the skylights, I would multiple every skylight by  5/12 to get a global 5% skylight.

 Hmmm....energy savings are going to plummet.
Thank you again Nick.

Proposed and Baseline areas/layouts matching works perfectly until you exceed either 40% for vertical or 5% for skylights.  See Table G3.1.5, baseline items c. and d.  This might be coincidence, but just to be cover all bases: 28% + 12% = 40% is an incorrect reading - the skylight and vertical fenestration thresholds are independent.

I think you are to leave the vertical fenestrations alone (being under the 40% threshold) and you need to proportionally lower the area of the skylights in the baseline model to get back to 5%.  Proposed model needs to match actual design so it's skylights remain the same.

I'm not certain how or if the project being a major renovation has any bearing on the matter.

Are you making the case that the existing skylights are envelope components not being touched, and so should remain equal in area between the models despite exceeding the 5% threshold?  Do you have additional new skylights complicating the matter?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling 90.1 Baseline Envelope for Existing + Additions

Dear forum users, I have modelled a project following Appendix G. and have received a review regarding my interpretation of % glazed area on the baseline.

The project is a mayor renovations + Additions (existing conditioned warehouse + New office building attached). There were no modification on % area of vertical and horizontal glazing on the existing bit of the building.

My approach was to model existing envelope, shape and fenestration, exactly the same in both proposed and baseline. The addition was modelled following the "maximum 40% for vertical fenestration and 5% for skylight" rule. The result of the whole building for baseline is, 28% vertically glazed and 12% of skylights (the existing bit was very different than 40%, and 5% respectively)
The reviewer states that the end result for the baseline should still be 40% and 5%. It is not very clear to me how would I get there.. Do I have to make the existing fenestration proportionally smaller, just like I would do for the baseline of a completely new building?

Thanks in advance.

Santiago.

The baseline guidelines might both still apply though, let me throw this interpretation out there. Either way, you should ask for clarification on your proposed path before submitting if possible.


1.       Model the existing as-is per the reference that you noted. Seems straightforward.

2.       Whole-building totals might still be required to match the 40% and 5%, unless superseded by #1. This seems to be the point of discussion with the reviewer.

In that case the baseline total glazing for the existing portion would be modeled as existing. The new construction baseline would have any remainder of glazing area up to 40%. It sounded like you would be below 40% total, so model as you did before with the basline = proposed.

For skylights the existing building "consumes" more than 5% of the whole project, therefore the skylight area would be capped at whatever the actual percentage is based on the existing. The baseline would not have skylights in the new construction unless they were required to be added by some other part of the code or local requirements in order to meeet the 5% requirement. This could benefit you if the project is adding photocell control of the lighting in the new addition in conjunction with the skylights.

G1.3 is tricky since there is also a new portion to the project that can still impact the overall percentages, even if the existing portion is modeled as-is. And none of the complex is excluded from the renovation, although the envelope may not be changing. Assuming that lighting, HVAC, and interiors are being renovated in the existing warehouse? Otherwise your LEED project boundary should only be the new addition.

Maria thanks for sharing your opinion. I will reach out to the reviewer.  It's good to know there can be different interpretation. I do understand that if you are certifying as "New construction and Mayor renovations" it might make sense that you need demonstrating savings against the full new Baseline defined by Appendix G.  It would be nice if future editions of the standard were more clear about this and other issues that seem to fall in grey areas.

Thanks.

Santiago,

I would reach out to the reviewer and argue that your original interpretation is correct. Appendix G Table 3.1.5 f that you quoted below clearly suggests that the baseline building design for renovation projects shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions. The section covers all aspects of envelope including thermal and solar properties, assembly type, and surface area, so there is no indication that the "existing conditions" mentioned in 3.1.5 f exclude fenestration / skylight area. I don't see why this rule should be void for projects that include both renovation and addition. Section G1.3 is also relevant: G1.3 Trade-Off Limits. When the proposed modifications apply to less than the whole building, only parameters related to the systems to be modified shall be allowed to vary. Parameters relating to unmodified existing conditions or to future building components shall be identical for determining both the baseline building performance and the proposed building performance. Since the window/skylight area is not modified, it should produce neither penalty nor credit for the proposed design.

Maria

Nick, thanks for the response. The answer is yes, I'am trying to make a case for exceeding the 5% threshold for existing bit of the project, which is not modified.
The project is a big existing conditioned warehouse, with lots of skylights (18% of roof area), the new bit is an office building, with more skylights (properly shaded this time!). I thought it would be fare to have a baseline which maintains the existing bit exactly the same (18% skylights), and the new addition according to Table G3.1.5 (5%).

David, exactly, that is another way to go. Even if I decide to maintain 40%
and 5% thresholds, there are some different ways of getting there,
considering the mixed existing + addition issue. This is why I agree
requesting some feedback is the way to go.
The existing warehouse was included because is part of the LEED scope and
because it doesn't meet *Table G3.1.2  Additions and alteration to exclude
existing building  "c. Design space temperature and HVAC system operating
setpoints and schedules on either side of the boundary between included and
excluded parts of the building are essentially the same."*

Some renovation is happening in the existing bit, lightings is fully
replaced to LED and roof insulation is added. Shading for skylights was
suggested and opted out by the client for various reasons during design. In
the project's weather, 3A, insulations is not as big of an issue as solar
radiation control. So worst case scenario, shading those skylights might be
simple solution to be close to the savings the project was aiming. On the
other hand It is never nice to tell a client you have to add something to
the project once construction has finished, so its worth defending our
approach and our clients interests with reviewers.

Hi all,

The preview version of jEPlus v1.5 has been made available on SourceForge. There are two key new features: an E+ IDF version converter GUI, and the GUI for executing Python scripts. The version converter tool scans a folder for files to convert, and it doesn?t rely on the version information in the IDF files, which can be a bother when you have many IDF snippets. Here is a short video tutorial demonstrating its use: http://youtu.be/RUDpmdkYI_g.

The Python runner tool has more symbolic significance than its functions at the moment. We have started learning Python and found it THE solution to our old post-processing/visualization problem after getting loads of parametric results. The idea is that users can write and share Python scripts, which will extend the functionality of the toolkit. But since we are still learning, there aren?t many examples we can show.

jEPlus v1.5 also offers experimental support for INSEL, although I am not sure how many INSEL users are here?

Best regards,

Yi

Dear Juan,
I am not an EE$ user, but the approach below is one I used in EnergyPlus before it could model VRF.  It may help you...

*         VRF with heat recovery:  A water source heat pump system does exactly the same functions as heat recovery VRF systems, but uses different equipment.  To model the VRF:
o   Assign fan power to match the VRF fan power
o   We'll want all of the actual power use to be reflected at the System level, not zone level, so define the WSHP compressor with a COP of 10,000.  That results in compressor power = load.
o   The WSHP plant loop will have a Boiler and Chiller, and only one or the other will operate to meet the loop needs, just like VRF.  Since neither of these have part load performance similar to the VRF outdoor unit, we want to make their energy use reflect loads only, and that requires boiler efficiency = 1.00 and chiller COP = 10,000.  (Note: This could also be accomplished using District heating and cooling)
o   After reporting the energy use for the boiler and chiller using  Meter:Custom, apply the proper VRF part load factors in a post-process calculation.

Hi Juan,

It is pretty tough to simulate VRF in EE4 unless you take some workaround
by modifying Doe file and export hourly results. Post processing is
necessary.

I strongly suggest that you should use Energypro (the same developer of EE4
if I am not wrong). Check this out

Message-ID: <CAOKTROahhf-EF+BHWV0vtC220my1JkXAmHtBqi42m6fJocqaNg@mail.gmail.com>

HI again,

I'm trying to model a VRF system using an infinitely efficient heat pump
(so as to bring the cooling/heating loads to the systems level and then
adjust with part-load performance at a post-processing stage).

The problem with this approach is that the heat pump units are using the
compressors even when they are just transferring heat within the loop
without input from the central plant, while the VRF system recovers heat
without any power input. Would using a COP of 10,000 take care of this as
this would result in an infinitely efficient compressor? How will the
condenser energy consumption be incorporated?


Thanks again,

Sebastian

Juan,
It's been a while I haven't used EE4 but I remember there was a limit on the COP that you can use. No matter what you enter, the COP in EE4 is limited to 8 I believe.
You need to do some tests or check your .doe file for the EIR (1/COP) value.

Would using a COP of 10,000 take care of this as this would result in an infinitely efficient compressor? How will the condenser energy consumption be incorporated?

Thanks again,
Sebastian

I am also having a similar problem for an office building in Ohio using eQuest.  The annual peak demand by end use report shows zero demand for cooling, yet there is the expected amount of space cooling in the monthly peak demand by end use and the expected amount of space cooling consumption kWh usage.  Everything else seems to be in order....

Could this be an eQuest glitch?

You have already decided that it is impossible for a working HVAC and lighting system to have zero demand.  Have you confirmed that these systems are actually operating? i.e., is there energy consumption?  If not, check schedules to make sure the systems turn on or (for HVAC) check setpoints to confirm that there is a demand.
If energy is consumed, but demand is not shown, you probably want to send the file to the E+ Help Desk. (I'm not sure how eQuest users get help :()

Best bet for eQuest-specific help is usually the [Equest-users] archives and the mailing list community, and there's an E+ counterpart mailing list as well.   That said a substantial amount of eQuest-specific and E+-specific queries are handled here as well on [Bldg-sim] - sometimes it's not always clear when a question is specific to software or more general in nature so the the [bldg-sim] serves as an effective catch-all.

To Tom's eQuest query (and I'm speaking specifically to eQuest - E+ users will have to confirm if any of this applies on your end):
It's important to recognize that monthly and annual "peak demand" values reported in most detailed/graphical reports do not strictly represent the maximum draw of each end-use - they represent the hour with the maximum draw on the associated meter, broken out by end-use through that hour.

By extension, your cooling system(s) can be operating normally and keeping the spaces cool when called for, but not be operating within the hour of maximum draw for each month or for the year.  This is not uncommon in the winter months for temperate and heating-dominated climates, particularly when there's substantial electric heating in play to overwhelm what the cooling systems require.

So that said, the graphical "Annual peak demand by end use" report is if I'm not mistaken reporting enduse draws for the peak hour over the whole simulated year - not seeing cooling in this pie chart is simply indicative of more substantial heating operating under the same meter.  You can review and confirm if and when cooling plays a part in your monthly peak demands by reviewing the monthly graphical charts or via the PS-E/PS-F detailed reports.

~Nick

Have you all looked at your hourly output to see what's going on there?
That always seems like a prudent first step in model debugging. I look at
hourly output from all models. That gets you closer to the root of the
problem, rather than looking at a particular report that you might or might
not understand.

It's been tested in a class here at the TU Berlin a bit already ( see the blog:
http://mrcomfy.org/?p=452 | http://mrcomfy.org/?p=481 ), went through some
update cycles and I think it's now useful enough to warrant me sharing it with
you- have a look at http://mrcomfy.org - full documentation is available there.

This is, of course, not a super new idea, but the precedents I could unearth are
either not openly available or do things slighty different, e.g. OpenStudio's
zone color coding. I'd be nonetheless grateful if you could point me to other
published precedents should they spontaneously occurr to you, since I'll do a
writeup of the method and would like to give credit where it's due.

All the best,

Max

PS I've been lurking on this list with another eMail address for ~6 years; it
feels strange to suddenly be contributing something, huh, tangible.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Now Open for Public Comment - DOE UMP Commercial New
 Construction Evaluation Protocol
Message-ID: <6692B6E504A5054682FDE225163A6E6F0FC2B3D5@mbx027-e1-nj-2.exch027.domain.local>

Dear Energy Simulation Professionals:
I wanted to make you were aware of the public comment period that opened up yesterday for a specific DOE Uniform Methods Project (UMP) measure - "Commercial New Construction Evaluation Protocol". See http://ump.pnnl.gov/forum.php for the comment site.  The main site for the UMP is here: https://www1.eere.energy.gov/office_eere/de_ump.html


Per the protocol description - "This protocol describes  best practices for evaluating "whole building performance" new construction projects in the commercial sector. The focus is on measures (or packages of measures) whose impacts are best evaluated using building simulation." The protocol describes a savings verification workflow adherent to IPMVP Option D, including descriptions of data requirements and collection methods. In addition, the protocol introduces (5) new terms for different (evolving) models used in new construction design assistance. And much more.
If you work on new construction energy models of commercial buildings that need to claim 'verified savings' over a baseline for some purpose (utility program incentives, LEED certification, etc.), I encourage you to read and comment on this proposed protocol. While guised as a protocol (not a standard), if not harmonized with existing protocols and evolving standards it may end up creating confusion in the marketplace than necessary.

At any rate, the comment period for this remains open until December 20th.

All the Best,

_Chris

If you're using the weather file with IES Radiance, you should make sure that the weather 
file contains Daylight Illuminances (Global, Direct Normal, Diffuse,Zenith, etc.), and not 
just the Solar Radiation, which indicates the amount of heat rather than light. Both of 
the two following weather files contain illuminance data, albeit they're all calculated:

There is an old ASHRAE IWEC weather file for Istanbul (circa 2001) in EPW format that can 
be downloaded for free from the EnergyPlus Weather web site.

There is  a new ASHRAE IWEC2 weather file for Istanbul (circa 2010) that is available at 
my Web site, but it is not free.  IWEC2 weather files are based on recorded weather 
station data for 12 to 25 years, and available for 3,012 locations outside the US and Canada.

For more info on  purchasing individual IWEC2 weather files, please go to

Roger the huge challenge.  Bear in mind that the project won't want to 
pay any more no matter how many things they change and the profession 
quickly becomes a losing proposition.

Dear all,

We are a group of students working on an academic project, regarding energy
simulation for design, and the site is in EI Yunque national forest in
Puerto Rico. Since it is a rain forest the weather data from San Juan is of
no use. Does anyone happen to have the weather data from the site, or from
a site with a similar weather?

I think you're much better off getting the weather data for the nearest location in Puerto 
Rico, than some generic site with similar weather (how would you know that it's similar, 
anyway?).  There are 6-7 weather stations in Puerto Rico in the TMY3 weather data set, of 
which the closest to El Yunque is Roosevelt-Roads 16 km to the east, but on the coast.  
The other alternative is a station called Palmer 16 kilometer to the north, for which 
Weather Underground seems to have data (search www.wunderground.com).  However, converting 
Weather Underground weather data to usable files for EnergyPlus simulations would take 
some effort.  I've done that twice, and it could easily take a day or two of work.

I assume that you're concerned with the microclimate differences between the rain forest 
and the nearby locations.  I think you can only get those if there is a weather station 
within the rain forest.  I frankly don't think you can reliably get such the microclimatic 
differences using modeled weather data, except for possibly adiabatic expansion 
(temperature depression) due to differences in elevation. Having said that, it's also easy 
to do the same adiabatic correction using measured data. Unless you find hourly measured 
data from the rain forest itself, my recommendation would be to use Roosevelt-Roads TMY3 
and correct for the elevation if you're so interested.

Depends on what you mean by ?successfully?  As far as the OS is concerned, yes, it runs fine under Windows 8.1.  I did get a fatal error in the GLASS category when running a simple 2-story office building with the default properties.  So, not a total success!

But, Win 8.1 seems to be healthy.

Cheers!

I have a factory/warehouse that is using natural ventilation for cooling. What is unusual is that the openings are fixed openings.

 

At first glance it seems that it would not even qualify as an enclosed space and therefore would not be eligible for energy modeling for LEED. The project is registered at USGBC however, of course I realize that may mean nothing.

 

If this project could be eligible for LEED certification, I am trying to come up with an approach and all I can think of is pretending the openings are operable and then following the guidelines as outlined in the Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED handbook.

 

I would appreciate any guidance anyone can offer on this seeming conundrum!

Message-ID: <1385115239.2711.YahooMailNeo@web194005.mail.sg3.yahoo.com>

Dear all,
We are modelling a retail store with cold rooms. The manufacturer claims to have installed high efficient refrigeration units than a commonly used equipment. The project is going for rating under commercial interior. Please let me know the baseline to model the refrigeration units and the methodology to model. Also is it possible to claim savings for refrigeration units for commercial interior projects. (Only savings from HVAC can be accounted in CI rating)?.

Message-ID: <B7FE24EB2E85FD47B9EB4A8DA59E76EFB4383FFE71@TREXCHMAIL.corp.tridel.com>

All,

A (hopefully) simple ASHRAE 90.1 baseline system question.

I have a building which is part office, part maintenance/storage garage.  The garage/maintenance portion is about ? of the total GFA.  Appendix G system type is #5 - Packaged VAV w RH.  However, I want to apply G3.1.1c as an exception, which states that system 3 or 4 should be used for zones which have special pressurization relationships, cross contamination requirements or code-required airflow rates. This is definitely the case.

My question is do I use system 3 or 4 for the garage/maintenance zones (both the predominant condition and the zones with the special requirements) or the office zones?  The wording leads me to believe its actual the office zones which need to be system type 3, but this seems backwards, and it's essentially the reverse of what is installed, which is VAV in the office, PSZ in the garage.

Regards,

Adam

On a recent LEED project I received a review comment that stated:

"The exception [it was exception G3.1.1b in my case] should be applied to lesser portion of building served by the system." The reviewer's interpretation was that the primary system selection applied to the LARGER BY AREA portion of the project, and the break-out system per the exception goes to the lessor by area portion of the project, which in your case sounds like you would end-up with a bizzaro switch on system types between the baseline and proposed model.

I guess this is just another one of those examples to file away when you end up with outlandish baseline systems per the Appendix G prescribed methodology that seems counter-intuitive.

You both may get additional answers by posting your questions to the 
LEEDuser.com since these are mostly LEED questions.

For the nat. ventilation question: Is there any mechanical equipment at 
all in the building? It is my understanding that you can model the HVAC 
that you have in order to submit to LEED. If not, I think you'll need to 
share more information about the building's geometry to get an answer. 
Being registered as a LEED project means nothing as far as it qualifying 
as an eligible project. Also, you can't model operable openings that 
don't exist. Sorry!

For the cold rooms question: refrigeration is a process load and all 
process loads must be modeled the same in the baseline and proposed 
cases, unfortunately. The only advantage you get from more efficient 
process loads is less "noise" in the overall model which helps in your 
overall percentage of energy savings.

Jill,
It seems you may be mis-understand the questions-- also the normal policy
of the list is to respond to individual posts on their own so that other
people who may have other ideas about the subject then yourself can reply.

With regards to fixed window natural ventilation: Christian who posed the
natural ventilation question has most likely completed more LEED projects
then most people on the list, surly he knows about LEED user and also knows
that there are countless loopholes in and interpretations of ASHRAE 90.1,
especially for natural ventilation a subject that is loosely defined by the
so called rules.  I would suggest to use the design builder external CFD
module to demonstrate your concept. I think that it sounds like a situation
of a semi heated space,  and that you may be able to make a case for the
same in the baseline as proposed if this an existing building and this is
the the condition of the building envelope before renovation-- if it is a
new building then the design could be changed to be acceptable by the
standards of 90.1 if necessary.

With regards to cold rooms; you could use the Energy Plus walk in
refrigerator objects to model them, and could do an exceptional calculation
to claim the energy saving benefits.

I need some orientation about thermal blocks. my project is an office
building applying to core and shell leed certification. I dont understand
how to build/draw thermal blocks in accordance with section 8.a to 8.d.
This is a 15 floors building, and the open spaces are similiar to this

Rathna,

For commercial refrigeration baseline details take a look at the Technical Guide Book 2012 by Alliant Energy. http://www.alliantenergy.com/wcm/groups/wcm_internet/@int/documents/document/mdaw/mdiz/~edisp/023759.pdf

Table 43 on p. 128 lists characteristics of new construction baseline systems, although it does not give a baseline efficiency for compressors. There is an equation to estimate compressor efficiency on p. 125, but the paragraph underneath states ?This equation should not be used to determine baseline compressor efficiency.?

For insulation of cold storage rooms take a look at Table 2 (p. 50) of ASHRAE?s Design Essentials for Refrigerated Storage Facilities.

NREL has been working on a document identifying commercial refrigeration baselines, including compressor efficiency, but I don?t think it has been published yet.

I?m not certain about the LEED rules since I don?t do many LEED models, but I believe you can take credit for reducing process loads using an exceptional calculation and documenting your justification for claiming the savings. I suspect that you will need to do an exceptional calculation anyway because some modeling programs won?t allow the thermostat settings to go as low the cold rooms will be.

Sincerely,

 Crist?an, defining thermal blocks for energy modelling can be tricky
sometimes and there is always many 'right' answers. It also depends on what
you are trying to demonstrate with your model. In this case,I'm having
trouble to understand what is happening in there. There might be some
issues with other Acad Referenced files... All I see is a floorplan with
what looks like the the outline of the building's envelope. With only this
info, IMO, is not enough to determine the 'correct' thermal block for LEED
Core&Shell. I would  be happy to meet you on skype and give you hand since
we are from the same part of the world (i.e. South America).

Best,
Santiago.

All,
A number of professionals in the Dallas/Fort Worth area are putting together a new IBPSA-USA chapter.  We have about a dozen participants so far but are still looking for more members.  Anyone involved in building energy and thermal modeling is welcome to participate.  Membership is for those local to Collin, Dallas, Denton or Tarrant counties but we're willing to extend that to others in the North Texas area if they're willing to attend meetings in the metro area.  No meeting venue has been identified yet.  We will try to find a centrally located one or rotate venues at our places of business.  Student members from schools like SMU, TCU, UNT, UTA, UTD, etc. are welcome.  So if you are a local modeler and would like to participate, please get in touch.  Information on IBPSA-USA membership can be found here<http://www.ibpsa.us/membership.shtml>.  Thanks,

Dear all,

We are evaluating a technology for energy recuperation and would therefore
do a thermodynamic analysis of the potential applications. Data centers is
one field of interest ...
Therefore, I am looking for some data on inlet and outlet temperatures and
flow rates of data centers of different sizes.

Just the temperatures and flow rates is sufficient at this stage. However
information on the temperature fluctuation (amplitude and frequency) might
be relevant as well.

Thanks a lot!

Message-ID: <CANmRH8WHnr=PPZDkvsY1pA6E7DSEBHo2LyaY5PxwC-bX_Yf0Kw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

We are working on a project that has a special occupancy space and we need
to determine a setback/setup temperature for moments that the space is not
occupied during working hours.

Section 6.4.3.3.2, of ASHRAE 90.1, states that setback temperature must be
13?C or lower, and setup temperature, 32?C or higher. I understand these
temperatures are for off-hours.

Are there such limits of setback/setup temperature for working hours? Or is
it defined by design?

Regards,
Anderson Letti

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling diversity in single zone apartments
Message-ID: <CAPAgWcytjqd1r6NjfUW83w1BGJ=fg1=+kCmy8LMezzK6jw3pAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm modelling a mixed office/residential tower building with 160 apartments
in tropical climate, for LEED. The apartments are centrally cooled with fan
coil units, in the living room and bedrooms. The design team sized the
chiller with a diversity of 0.5, probably assuming that when the occupants
are in the living room, they're not cooling the bedrooms or something of
the sort.

Given the number of apartments, I modelled each apartment as a single
block. I cannot use zone multipliers because of the specific geometry of
the building. I have one combined FCU for each apartment, which is of
course either on or off. I'm also grouping apartments based on orientation,
but that's beside the point.

My question is about an approach to modelling the diversity of use of FCUs
in the apartments. With my modelling simplification, I cannot model the
diversity of cooling within an apartment. So what would be an acceptable
approach?

I can only think of turning cooling off in half of the apartments, though
apartments with cooling turned off are occupied and have internal loads.
Would a LEED reviewer be ok with such an approach. Or is there a better way?

Thanks,
Patrick

Subject: [Bldg-sim] New Free EnergyPlus Results Viewer
Message-ID: <A0E02212526D2847B8F1F78E9A5B17C901BEB75662EF@DBSERVER01.designbuilder.local>

<Please excuse cross postings>

DesignBuilder has now released v1.0 of our free standalone EnergyPlus Results Viewer application. The Results Viewer allows you to easily generate graphical views of data held in EnergyPlus .eso output files as well tabular results held in the .htm summary output files. You can load multiple .eso files into a session and compare results on the same graph.

An example screenshot is shown below comparing results for a ground source heat pump chilled ceiling system with displacement ventilation with and without changeover mixed mode natural ventilation.

The main Results Viewer v1.0 features are:


*         Opens and displays .eso and .htm summary files generated by all EnergyPlus applications, including DesignBuilder, OpenStudio, EPLaunch etc.

*         Can be used to display all building and HVAC output variables including HVAC node temperatures, mass flow rates and humidity levels.

*         Compare results sets for any number of simulations on the same graph - even sub-hourly timestep results when the number of timesteps is different between runs.

*         View results graphically or in a grid.

*         Export results for further analysis in a spreadsheet.

*         View tabular results held in .htm files and associate the tabular results with an .eso dataset.

*         Select the time interval from Monthly, Daily, Hourly and Timestep - depending on the data in the .eso file.

*         Available reports are listed for the selected time interval and can be selected for viewing.

*         A crosshair option allows you to display numeric values for all displayed data series for any point in time.

*         Show multiple graphs on the screen at once.

*         Include multiple Y-axes on each graph as required by the selected reports.

*         When viewing datasets for long simulation periods the zoom function allows you to focus in on shorter time per iods.

*         Sort the list of available outputs by Area or Report type

*         Store all session data and settings in a single compact file for ease of storage and communication. Session files can be emailed to colleagues and easily opened to see precisely the same results as the sender.

*         Associate the .eso extension with the Results Viewer allowing easy integration with EPLaunch and other EnergyPlus GUIs.

*         Integration with DesignBuilder v3.4 and later.
You can download the EnergyPlus Results Viewer at no cost from:
