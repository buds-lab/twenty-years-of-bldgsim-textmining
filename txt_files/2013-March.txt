Khristiam,

Is it possible that your space has extremely high latent (moisture) loads?
Your results would indicate an SHR (Sensible Heat Ratio) of only around 0.5,
which doesn't seem typical for office occupancies.

e.g., 300 cfm would give a sensible cooling of around 6600 Btu/h.  SHR =
6600/12000 = 0.55.

Regards,

Dear Sirs

I made a simulation of two one floor building for offices.
The results indicate the following:
Area / Sypply / Design Capacity
2810 sqft / 3974 cfm / 271cfm/ton
1017 swft / 1306 cfm / 302cfm/ton

Why the software gives these results so differente from the usual rule
of thumb 400cfm/ton?

Thank you very much.

Hello everyone,

I'm a new user to Energy Plus and am trying to work through a simple model using the HVAC Templates.  The configuration is a packaged VAV system with hot water loop and NG boiler, with heating cooling and airflows autosized.

My simulation is not running as it is giving me the following error:
"CheckEnvironmentSpecifications: Sizing for Zones has been requested but there are no design environments specified."  The same is given for system and plant objects.

I was under the impression from the I/O reference that the EXPIDF processor takes care of this and that these objects shouldn't be entered.  This seems to work for several of the example files as well (they do not define sizing, but do autosize).  What could I not be specifying, or specifying incorrectly to get this error? If I check No for Sizing Calcs under SimulationControl it also doesn't like this and will ask this to be checked as yes, so either way I don't know how to get around it.  IDF is attached.

Thanks,

Adam Barker

It's asking for design environments, or design days.  In the examples, 
you should see some SizingPeriod:DesignDay objects.  You will need to 
add similar objects for your location.  If you are using one of the 
standard EnergyPlus weather file locations, there is a ddy file included 
with the epw weather that contains all of the standard ASHRAE design 
days in EnergyPlus format.  Just copy/paste the desired design days from 
the ddy to your idf.

Adam,

You might get more response if you post your question to the EnergyPlus_Support bulletin 
board, which is focused specifically on EnergyPlus issues.

I think what's happening is that you've not specified any Design Days  
(SizingPeriod:DesignDay), so EnergyPlus doesn't know what to use for the design 
calculations.  Please note that "autosizing" works differently between EnergyPlus and 
DOE-2.  In DOE-2, it means that the program figures out the peak load over the simulation 
period which it uses to then "size" the equipment.  In EnergyPlus, it means that, given 
the design day specifications, the program will calculate the equipment size.   To me, 
that always seems more like "sizing", not "autosizing".

Hi Adam,

E+ is looking for sizing objects. At the top of the IDF in "SimulationControl" you have said yes, you want zone sizing, system sizing and plant sizing.
[cid:image001.jpg at 01CE1697.0A3BB140]

You have two choices


1)      Put no next to each of these objects ie - Do zone sizing - no etc.. Make sure you say yes to Run simulation though.



2)      Add these sizing objects, they can be found about half way through the idf and are called Sizing:zone, Sizing:System, Sizing:Plant


As far as I remember when you use the templates you do not need to specify these sizings so just changing SimulationControl to no for those areas will probably work

Good luck

Annie

      Simergy Public Beta 2 posted

A second public beta version of the Simergy free graphical user 
interface for EnergyPlus has been posted at 
http://simergy-beta.lbl.gov/.  Key features of Simergy include:

- Comprehensive and Loop Level HVAC System Templates for typical and 
high performance systems
- Drag and drop component-level editing of HVAC systems to adapt 
templates and build custom systems
- Geometry options:
     - import of building geometry from 3D CAD/BIM using IFC or gbXML
     - build custom geometry from 2D plans (dwg/dxf) or draw free form 
and extrude vertically
     - build your own geometry from base shapes
- Management of multiple design alternatives
- Pre-defined reports and interactive visualization of EnergyPlus output
- Training and support documentation including links to EnergyPlus 
documentation.

It is worth going through the 1 page Essential Reading included as part 
of the installation before using Simergy.

*Contest!
*

To encourage beta-testers to report issues, we have organized a contest 
with iPad 4's as prizes (donated by Simergy Development Partner Trane) 
for the contestants who document the greatest number of issues.  Details 
will be emailed shortly to people who register as beta testers.

Our thanks to all who have expressed interest in Simergy, particularly 
to those who have volunteered to be beta-testers.

This data is way better than I can get, Aaron.  I don't know the CFMs 
these fans move, but for me it is normal to see the smallest H.P. for 
the smallest 1.5 / 2 ton fan coil at 1/5 H.P.  Seeing something lower 
than that would be a godsend.  Who made these fans and how much air do 
they move? Typically the fan coil manufacturers that I work with don't 
bother giving fan H.P. (listed on your chart as Motor H.P.?) but rather 
jump right to the motor nominal H.P. which is always higher.

But I agree with you regarding amps.  Typically the amps are much higher 
than the corresponding H.P. for unknown reasons.  Startup current?  
Perhaps...

I also note that your data has higher watts at higher voltages in some 
cases, for unknown reasons, along with "peak" watts at 208/230 in other 
cases.  I can't explain that.

Thanks for sending this, but if you can identify the manufacturer and 
the product, I would be very grateful.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] performance evaluation in France
Message-ID: <CAB_-mWOip1E+EmTpG=31aofFMvMbtaF_3QA6-9AFHVebA3Vasg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear,

As for the whole of Europe, also in France performance evaluation tools
have been developped according to the EU directive.
I am trying to see how new innovative technologies can be implemented in
France. Generally they have to pass specific tests and can receive a
certification if the quality is high enough.

Could anyone provide me further information on this certification procedure?

Thanks a lot,

Leen

Hi All,
         Is there any ACPH  recommende value for operation theatre given in
ASHRAE 62  standards It is 100% fresh air AHU . but the cfm sized  is very
high 6cfm/sqft as per design and if i reduce it to 3cfm/sqft i am still not

Robert,

 

I was looking at the engineering manual for JCI fan-coil units,
http://bit.ly/YPtNcH.  They say "Fan Coil Units are equipped with permanent
split-capacitor (PSC) motors with three taps (High, Medium and Low) which
provides variable horsepower outputs."  So I understand the "Motor HP"
listed in the table below is output HP.  I'm not sure why the watts were
sometimes higher for higher voltages; they're generally pretty consistent
except for the size 20.

 

In another table they also list the power input for various configurations
at ARI conditions with airflow indicated.  They're generally around 0.3
W/cfm which sounds good to me but that's at 0" or 0.05" ESP which I think is
unrealistic for a ducted system.  At least the airflow is indicated and they
have the fan curves.

 

Regards,
Aaron

This data is way better than I can get, Aaron.  I don't know the CFMs these
fans move, but for me it is normal to see the smallest H.P. for the smallest
1.5 / 2 ton fan coil at 1/5 H.P.  Seeing something lower than that would be
a godsend.  Who made these fans and how much air do they move?  Typically
the fan coil manufacturers that I work with don't bother giving fan H.P.
(listed on your chart as Motor H.P.?) but rather jump right to the motor
nominal H.P. which is always higher.

But I agree with you regarding amps.  Typically the amps are much higher
than the corresponding H.P. for unknown reasons.  Startup current?
Perhaps...

I also note that your data has higher watts at higher voltages in some
cases, for unknown reasons, along with "peak" watts at 208/230 in other
cases.  I can't explain that.

Thanks for sending this, but if you can identify the manufacturer and the
product, I would be very grateful.


Cheers!

Robert,

 

I've also run into problems obtaining combined (fan and motor) efficiency
and input power, mostly with terminal units such as heat pumps and fan coil
units but also with individual fans.  What I've often done is used the watts
listed in their electrical tables.  For example, below if you take their
size 20 at high fan speed, they classify the motor HP at 1/30HP or 25W
(output power).  I've taken the subsequent columns to mean input power so
the watts at 115V is then 57W which would make the motor is 44% efficient
and that seems reasonable to me.  The listed amps don't necessarily equate
to the same wattages, they are usually higher so my only theory is that this
is the starting amps.  

 

I'd be interested in finding out what other have to say.  I have tried
talking to some local equipment reps without any luck.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan Power

 

This is a DOE-2 question, I think, but I am applying it to EnergyPro.  I 

am asking here in the hopes that some will have a more in-depth 

knowledge of DOE-2 and how it relates to fan power.  I am also hoping 

that some here will be able to reflect on the theory and application of 

fan power and energy as it relates to actual systems and modeling.

 

When inputting indoor fan power, I have used many sources for the fan 

power.  I sometimes use the motor nameplate, which I believe is too high 

in every case.

 

I also sometimes use FLA or RLA, which I also do not believe are 

accurate, but sometimes give more realistic numbers.

 

Some manufacturers give fan BHP at design conditions, which I find to be 

very helpful, but not everybody is that helpful.

 

It has been suggested that I calculate the fan BHP using the theoretical 

formula *** Fan BHP = (cfm x static press "w.c.) / (6356 x fan 

efficiency) *** and then use a conservative fan efficiency (maybe 50%) 

for a good number.  This gives a much lower value than the other 

methods, and I am trying to see if there is anything wrong with this 

approach.

 

As I understand the usage, indoor fan power is divided by motor and 

drive efficiency to come up with fan energy.  So the fan BHP is the 

starting point.  Having this too high drives up fan energy, sometimes 

dramatically, and can influence the proposed case quite a bit if there 

are lots of fans, even small fans.

 

 

Any thoughts on this approach would be very much appreciated.

Thanks Aaron,

That's very helpful.  I had looked at the Johnson units before and been 
distracted by their not having obvious DX ratings, seeming to have more 
on water loops than DX loops, but they do say that they provide DX coils 
too.

Thanks again!

You should check with the design team to see what the governing codes are from the local authorities. In terms of ASHRAE references, 2011 Handbook of Applications Chapter 8 or Standard 170 will take precedence over ASHRAE 62.1, since the criteria in this case is for infection control purposes which goes beyond the comfort requirements in 62.1. There are a number of other references that the design team might be using. These might include the client?s own design standards which may be even higher than the regulatory requirements.

Regarding your prior post about the reheat ? it will be a significant quantity, this is typical. However for reheat to be higher than the cooling end-use during a peak summer month should be reviewed. Assuming your location has economizer hours in the winter, the reheat could easily be higher than the cooling on an annual basis unless the design is including measures to reduce the need for reheat.

This is a timely subject.  I have been working on 
some very large distribution warehouses.  The 
staff are never all in one place at one time 
except morning, breaks and the end off 
shift.  The local authorities are asking that 
ASHRAE 62.1 be followed - warehouses at 0.06 
cfm/sf.  A half million square foot warehouse 
ends up with a lot of out door air that needs to 
be conditioned, especially in summer to remove 
the latent load.  I went through the Handbook of 
Applications and the Industrial Ventilation 
reference manual but found no guidance that would 
allow the OA to be lower than that value.

When one considers that over 3/4 of that space is 
solid from floor to ceiling with the stacks of 
crates, boxes etc.  it seems a very large amount 
of outdoor air for the floor space that is no "solid".

Does anyone have experience with this sort of 
facility and reducing outdoor air levels below that 0.06 cfm/sf.

Dear all,

For a non-residential building in California, I am assessing the possibility of including the electricity produced by a PV System in my energy consumption of my proposed building.

Do we know if this is possible, to balance my Net-zero Energy building against the reference building?

My energy consumption balance without the PV System might exceed that of the reference building.

Any ideas if this will be included in the 2013 version of title 24?

Thanks in advance for your answers.
Regards
Nadir Abdessemed

Dear Chris,
My understanding of the area ventilation requirement is concern for off-gassing of VOCs and similar chemicals which are deemed harmful.  It will be difficult to  avoid that requirement!
On the other hand, my experience with many warehouses and distribution centers is that it is very rare to have less than about 0.2 air changes per hour (average) from infiltration. For a 30 foot tall warehouse, that is equivalent to about 0.1 cfm / sq.ft.
The summary, assuming I did the math properly in a hurry, is that you?ll heat the 0.06 cfm/sq.ft. plus some more just for infiltration ? so nothing is ?wasted?.  Do you feel any better ??
p.s., Almost all of my warehouse experience is with heated-only facilities.  Perhaps the air conditioned facilities are better constructed, but I?m doubtful.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] OT fresh air

This is a timely subject.  I have been working on some very large distribution warehouses.  The staff are never all in one place at one time except morning, breaks and the end off shift.  The local authorities are asking that ASHRAE 62.1 be followed - warehouses at 0.06 cfm/sf.  A half million square foot warehouse ends up with a lot of out door air that needs to be conditioned, especially in summer to remove the latent load.  I went through the Handbook of Applications and the Industrial Ventilation reference manual but found no guidance that would allow the OA to be lower than that value.

When one considers that over 3/4 of that space is solid from floor to ceiling with the stacks of crates, boxes etc.  it seems a very large amount of outdoor air for the floor space that is no "solid".

Does anyone have experience with this sort of facility and reducing outdoor air levels below that 0.06 cfm/sf.

You should check with the design team to see what the governing codes are from the local authorities. In terms of ASHRAE references, 2011 Handbook of Applications Chapter 8 or Standard 170 will take precedence over ASHRAE 62.1, since the criteria in this case is for infection control purposes which goes beyond the comfort requirements in 62.1. There are a number of other references that the design team might be using. These might include the client???s own design standards which may be even higher than the regulatory requirements.

Regarding your prior post about the reheat ? it will be a significant quantity, this is ttypical. However for reheat to be higher than the cooling end-use during a peak summer month should be reviewed. Assuming your location has economizer hours in the winter, the reheat could easily be higher than the cooling on an annual basis unless the design is including measures to reduce the need for reheat.

HI Chris,

I did design a refrigerated warehouse and did 
struggle with this (The warehouse was to be LEED 
certified and we had to meet ASHRAE 62.1)
The solution I found was to use the IAQ procedure 
in 62.1.  We calculate the contaminant, mosthly 
CO2 from people and arrive with a total cfm a lot 
smaller (20 cfm/person) than the ventilation rate procedure.

Imagine if we had to use 0.06 cfm/sqft, the 
refrigeration load would have been a lot higher.
After discussion with a lot of other refrigerated 
warehouse designer, the rarelly introduce fresh air.

Hope this help

Martin

Leen,

Barring places with geothermal hot spots, ground temperatures are calculated using a 
simple equation developed by the late Dr. Tamami Kusuda at NBS (National Bureau of 
Standards, now renames NIST National Institute of Science and Technology) in the early 
1970's that assumes a constant deep ground temperature of the average annual air 
temperature + 1 K. This equation is basically a sine curve that dampens and lags the 
annual air temperature profile depending on the soil conductivity and depth below the 
surface.

All that is worked out in any of the processed weather files, such as the IWEC2 weather 
files available from ASHRAE for $229 for the entire set of 3,012 or individually from my 
company for $35 a station.  For your location (Nador), the closest IWEC2 weather file is 
for Melilla 8 kilometers to the north, for which the monthly ground temperatures at 1 
meter below grade are:
16.7  15.7  15.6  16.1  18.0  19.9  21.5  22.6  22.6  21.8  20.2  18.4
(converted to Celsius from Rankine in DOE-2 *.BINM weather file for Melilla)

Thank you very much Robert.

I wonder, if I drive the chiller plant directly with the PV system, couldn't we argue that I can then draw my system boundary around Chiller+PV for a very efficient cooling system, i.e. solar cooling ...?

This efficient system would then reduce my energy consumption associated to cooling, no?

Kind regards
Nadir

As far as I know, Nadir, that argument won't work with CA Title-24 
Energy Compliance.

Maybe next year!

How is it that the energy consumption of your building might exceed that 
of the reference building?  Using PVs seems like a very expensive way to

Robert

I'm not sure what climate you are designing for, but if it is heating-dominated I'd suggest you take a look at designing around devices such as the AmericanAldes CAR (Constant Air Regulator) flow control devices. Devices like these can provide a simple solution to preventing floor-to-floor stack effect issues (whose effects are not negligible in a high-rise located in a heating dominated climate) that exhaust systems will need to compensate for. If sized and installed correctly, they can mitigate odor migration (cooking, etc.) and allow an exhaust fan to actually be TAB/commissioned to the design flow and provide good pressure balance.

Couple that with AEROSEAL or similar technology applied to the exhaust risers, and I think you will have a best-in-class system that will serve the building well (no pun intended).

As far as 'design guides' - I' don't know if any specific pdf docs, etc. IMHO AmercianAldes website has a good document library you might want to check out.  I've had good experiences with my local Aldes rep in providing technical support as well.

All the Best,

Dear Joe,

I have the following concerns.

My (potentially and only formally badly performing) proposed building will not be a true representation of my (hopefully well performing, Net Zero Energy) real building as certain design features, according to my understanding, can not be considered in title 24 performance approach, e.g.:

-Exterior movable sun protection to ensure my 100% glazed fa?ade is sufficiently protected
-Solar protection by trees,
-increased daylight due to generous glazing
-geothermal cooling
-some more technologies successfully implemented in other countries but not mentioned in title 24 ...

The PV has actually nothing to do with this, we have them anyway to reach Net Zero. I just ask myself how we can formally represent our well performing building (again, irrespective of the PV) with a building that does not allow for the set of measures as suggested above.

Does this make sense?
Regards
Nadir, Transsolar

Robert,
I am assuming you are wanting to model them from an energy consumption
standpoint.  I am a fire protection engineer.  High rise building exhaust
systems have to be well coordinated with the building's smoke control
systems and requires close coordination with the adopted building and fire
codes.  That doesn't mean systems can't be designed for energy efficiency,
they just need fail safe controls that put them into very specific
sequences of operation once a smoke control event is triggered.  If
you Google "high rise building exhaust systems" you will get more than
enough current reading material on the subject to weed through.  I'd start
with some of the publications from the national labs and research based
articles.  There seems to be a fair amount of info on variable speed
systems in mid to high rise residential applications and historic
structures.  I do not design or study many systems for high rise buildings
so I do not have a specific reference to steer you toward.
Dennis

Nadir,

Have you actually done simulations to show that your proposed design 
fails to meet the Title-24 performance budget?  Title-24 is a minimum 
performance standard, so if your basic design without the extra features 
cannot meet Title-24, that would tell me there's something suboptimal 
about your design.  I don't see anything in the extra features you 
mentioned that necessitates nor benefits from a higher base load, so if 
you were to modify your design and make it compliant to Title-24, you 
may find the features to work even better, and further reduce the need 
for PV.

I am not a fan of 100% glazed facades, especially for sunny, mild to hot 
climates like in California.  Whenever I see an all-glazed building with 
elaborate movable shading, I always wonder why didn't the architect 
reduce the amount of glazing?  From the studies I've done, the trade-off 
between
daylighting and cooling loads peaks at about 20% WWR, beyond which 
cooling energy use increases more than lighting energy savings.

I haven't followed Title-24 too closely these days, but I do remember 
the reasons why the Energy Commission eliminated the credit for shading 
devices a long time ago - they found they were often not installed, can 
break, or were not used.  There must be similar concerns about trees.

I have a question about the fan power calculation used for 2001 epact
models.

 

The NREL guidelines say to use the 2001 fan power allowance instead of
appendix G. However, the 2001 guidelines are only for nameplate horsepower.
The nameplate requirements are actually the same in 2001 and 2004. 

 

COMNET says to use the formula bhp = nhp * eff_motor, then fan power (watts)
= (bhp * 746)/eff_motor

 

This comes out to fan power(watts) = nhp * 746

 

This doesn't seem to make sense to me. What have you guys been using for fan
power?

As part of the Advanced Design + Optimization (ADOPT) project, we held a Design Optimization Competition in Oct-Dec 2012 (see http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/content/view/135/206/).

The Competition attracted 201 participants from 37 countries/regions, and received 30 submissions from 12 countries by the closing date in December. We have now put all the finalists online, so you can analyse their designs and see if you can further improve the performance. The models and reports are here: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~adopt/wiki/doku.php?id=competition:submissions. Please feel free to leave comments on the submissions. To me, it is still a mystery how 018 and 214 achieved their low carbon emissions.

By the way, all models are in DesignBuilder format. The evaluation copy of DesignBuilder can view the models and existing simulation results even after the evaluation period has expired.

Cheers,

Message-ID: <C0C677C05CEF824C9DE8655599A3760DB847AE6D@exch01.adivl.ivl.se>

Dear all,
I like to model building energy use in an environment which does not limit me to pre-defined input data fields and keep code hidden in a black boxes. I like to have the option to go beyond the interface and be able to model odd design of buildings and HVAC solutions. However, I am not a computer programmer and why invent the entire wheel again. Therefor I look for a tool/environment which already has some building modules. I have been thinking about TRNSYS.
The Modelica language seems also very interesting. BERKELY lab has some building component library and moreover do I get the impression that Modelica is relatively easy to use and learn and do perhaps not require Master degree in programming to master.
Comments are welcome

Message-ID: <CAN1ZnDtw9HjxGBP8S5hJ0YsytoWD37PZQV718bD9x0Jy=mVmOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Join us *Tuesday, March 19* for the next meeting of the Rocky Mountain
Energy Simulation Engineers (RMESE). Five masters and PHD candidates from
the University of Colorado will have 15 minutes each to present on their
respective energy modeling projects for their research. The
presenters/presentations for the evening will be as follows:

*Neal Kruis*

How do you account for heat loss from your building foundation? Many energy
modelers either drastically simplify this heat loss in their models or
neglect it entirely. This is because the multi-dimensional, large-timescale
nature of foundation heat losses can become very computationally intensive,
to the point where it becomes time prohibitive for most modeling projects.

My research aims at answering several unanswered questions about foundation
heat loss:

?         How significant is foundation heat loss relative to other loads
in the building?

?         How good are our current tools at estimating these losses?

?         What can be done to improve theses estimations and reduce
computation time?

?         What are best practices for insulating building foundations?

*Anna Osborne*

A grant awarded to the International Center for Appropriate and Sustainable
Technology (ICAST) from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) is funding a study to assess the effect of energy
conservation measures (ECMs) and behavioral change measures (BCMs) on the
energy use patterns of 800 units of multi-family low-income residential
properties. Since the effects of ECMs are known and calculable, the main
goal of the study is to determine the degree of change that can be achieved
through education of the occupants and combined effects of ECMs and BCMs.
Anna has also developed a Matlab program which performs complex linear
regression on utility data to assess the degree of efficiency of the
building in question. The energy modeling component involves a sensitivity
study on occupant behavior by adjusting schedules and setpoints as well
as comparison to the Matlab program. The results are still preliminary.

* *

*Ben Brannon*

Ben Brannon will be presenting the initial development of his thesis on the
Modeling and Control Design and Field Experimentation of a Thermally
Activated Residence.  The project stems from a home in Missouri that
attempts to direct heat obtained from massy walls to beneficial locations
around the home and control radiative heat transfer.



*Lincoln Harmer*

This project serves as a proof-of-concept that calibrated building models
when applied real-time information provide enhanced energy management and
diagnostic capabilities. Rather than comparing against a static baseline as
is customary in Monitoring Based Comissioning (MBCx), the building models
used in this project are dynamically kept in tune with the actual building,
over time horizons stretching several time scales. A straightforward energy
management application involves determining the percent deviation in
facility natural gas consumption or electricity use between the actual
building and its model over the last day, week, month, and year; a
predefined threshold of permissible deviation (say +/- 10 ) would then
trigger an alarm or alert to the building management staff. Selecting the
right performance metrics will be part of this research. Envisioned
examples of extended diagnostic capabilities include a) fault detection and
diagnosis (FDD) such as finding the most likely HVAC system parameters that
explain the observed consumption patterns and thus detecting system
degradation, b) prediction of facility energy use and electrical demand for
the next day or week, and c) load aggregation for multiple buildings to be
served by an electrical supplier in a deregulated utility context. The
simulation models employed may be white box models based on first
principles, statistical black box models using only monitored data, or
inverse gray box models that combine reduced order building physics with
simplified models for the energy systems. These inverse gray box models
involving both first principles as well as parameter estimation appear as
likely contenders.  The expected result is a software demonstration of
using a building model and measured historical and/or real-time building
information for building performance evaluation. While many of the research
questions may be answered using surrogate data, we?re collecting real-time
data from two facilities and are aiming to prove the concept on both
buildings using a real-time field implementation.



*Ryan Tanner*

My research is entitled *Stochastic Optimal Control of Mixed Mode Buildings
Considering Occupant Driven Uncertainty*.

I use offline model predictive control to optimize the controls of
(simulated) mixed mode buildings, a process which results in 'optimal
control datasets'. Next, I use machine-learning algorithms to derive viable
BAS control rules from the optimal control datasets. EnergyPlus has been
the building energy modeling tool used throughout my research, providing
virtual test-buildings to try different controls in. Throughout all
simulations, occupant behavior is accounted for by one of two methods. (1)
Co-simulation using the building controls virtual test bed (BCVTB) to
couple the EnergyPlus simulation with occupant behavior algorithms written
in matlab. (2) Writing occupant behavior algorithms directly into
EnergyPlus via the Energy Management System (EMS).

This will be an exciting group of presentations, so make sure you join us
to support our future modelers!!!

We will be meeting at *The Tavern Downtown (1949 Market Street, Denver, CO
80202) at 6:00 pm Tuesday, March 19 *for* *the five short presentations and
drinks.

Please RSVP to Jessie Jones at jjones at rmhgroup.com or (303)312-4641 so that
we can make sure our reservation is large enough. This is not invite only-
so pass the word on to coworkers, colleagues, and other industry
professionals who may be interested.

Thank you,
*RMESE Steering Committee

Hi Jacob,

Just my 2 cents;

Disclaimer; I have only had contact with Modelica (some training,
conference, browsing), and much more TRNSYS experience.

If you were a consultant - looking to simulate new and existing buildings
and recommend energy retrofits for example, I would recommend TRNSYS over
Modelica. But because you need to create component models (no escaping
programming sorry), and because you are a researcher, you can definately
consider Modelica.

You're right, it's possible to do this in either TRNSYS or Modelica. The
learning curve for both would be comparable, in their own quirky ways.
Creating new components is also similar effort for both depending on the
component. You will definitely have to learn some programming concepts in
either case. I think however Modelica components have at least the
*potential* to be cleaner and more elegant than TRNSYS code.

TRNSYS has more component models, but you should really define exactly what
models you really need and compare both tools! Also check external
component libraries - TESS, Modelon...

Creating a complex building shape with windows, zones, etc. is probably
much easier in TRNSYS and it's 3D interface, so if you have complex
geometry, +1 point for TRNSYS.

Also important is training and local experts to ask about strange errors, I
should think you are well situated to get support for Modelica!

And then you must also consider the longevity and impact of your research -
Modelica is... fresher?

Cheers,

Marcus

Hello All,
I have many projects located in downtown Los Angeles. I am looking for some experience from the community on which TMY weather files that people use.
As for DOE file availability, there are LAX, Burbank, Hawthorn, Pasadena...and a few others in the area.
There is no TMY file officially available for downtown Los Angeles. Both ASHRAE and the California Energy Commission have design day weather statistics, but no 8760 weather data.
Short of using 8760 data that we have created from weather stations and other sources; what have all of you don?
Sorry in advance for cross posting.
Thanks,
Andy

Andrew,

Downtown Los Angeles is one of the 86 locations for which I have created a CZ2010 weather 
file for the California Energy Commission.  I am in the process of creating a Web page to 
allow download of these weather files, as well as other "typical year" and historical year 
weather files (Those created for or by government entities are free, those created 
commercially or for non-governmental entities are sold), which should be up sometime this 
week.  In the meanwhile,   you can access this file temporarily with this link

http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/downloads/CZ2010_10_1027/LOS-ANGELES-DOWNTOWN_722874_CZ2010.zip

When the Web site is finally up and running, there will be more information about the 
provenance behind all these weather files.

Jacob

I second Marcus' comments and like to add the following:

The page
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/userGuide/gettingStarted.htmlhas
some pointers for how to get started with Modelica.
The tutorials on
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/latest/help/Buildings_Examples_Tutorial.htmlshow
you what is involved in composing a model using existing component
models. Depending on your application, you may still need to develop some
own component models (typically by modifying existing models). In my view,
since you are a researcher, this is time well spent; Modelica is a language
whose user base is fast growing and the principle of equation-based
modeling is adopted by many system simulation programs.

For modeling building envelops, Modelica has currently limitations for
buildings with many rooms in terms of run-time. You therefore may want to
consider modeling the building envelop in E+, and linking it to Modelica
through the External Interface of E+, either through Functional Mockup
Units or through the Building Controls Virtual Test Bed.

All the best,

Michael

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling simplification for structural concrete columns
Message-ID: <CAPAgWcx-hbZFJ3iy7tLqy3fpoOaxPg8Ki6V-EPqGi1q8uMp=1g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I'm wondering how best to simplify a model when considering structural
concrete columns.
My modelling is in the context of the LEED whole building energy modelling.
So I'm concerned with accuracy as much as acceptability by the LEED
reviewers. I've read the ASHRAE 90.1 user's manual but didn't find a
satisfactory answer.

Here's an example:

        ----
wall   |    | wall
-------|    |------
       |    |
        ----
   concrete column

I can see 3 options for simplifying, each with its own issues:

1. Make the external surface of the column at the same level of the
surrounding walls and model the column surface as having its true thickness
. The issue is that it alters the area of the space inside and doesn't
account for the shading effect of the column.

2. Follow the internal boundary of the column, which introduces 3 surfaces.
Not sure what construction thickness to assign to these surfaces. This
preserves the internal space area but alters the shading effect of the
column.

3. Follow the external boundary of the column. This also introduces 3
surfaces. Not sure what construction thickness to assign to these surfaces
either. It preserves the shading effect of the column but alters the area
of the internal space.

I'm leaning towards option 1. What do you think? Are they other better
options I overlooked?

Of course, things get a bit more complicated when the walls either side are
not aligned or in the same plan...

Thanks!
Patrick

   - ASHRAE 90.1 does not require internal mass to be modeled in the
   baseline.
   - ASHRAE 90.1 does not require self shading to be modeled in the
   baseline.
   - ASHRAE 90.1 requires a light weight wall assembly for the baseline.

So the conclusion is that this does not need to be modeled in the baseline
and the question becomes how to model this in the proposed building, or
actually "what gets the project more LEED credits" If I where to do it I
would: (in E+)

   - Ignore the shading element of the concrete pillars and consider the
   walls that separate the zones the only thing that matters for shading.
   - Dependant on the other wall construction-- if mass than add the
   thickness to the total wall area-- if steal framed, wood&other or metal
   than bridge wall with column and add internal mass to account for thermal
   mass.

My conclusion is your #1 should be fine, especially if your not attempting
to get credit for the exposed thermal mass..

To the original post, I would use the line of the wall and ignore the columns. If you feel that there is a considerable shading effect, then use side fins or a building shade. Look at a section of wall the width of one column spacing as calculated the combined U value and thermal mass of the wall to see if the columns will have enough of an effect to make it worth modeling. I don't know how large the columns you are referring to are but it is likely that they would have a negligible effect on the model as a whole, especially when you consider the uncertainty of other values that are input. There is a line in Table G3.1.5 saying that other envelope assemblies that cover less than 5% of the total area need not be explicitly model and can be averaged into other wall assemblies.

As to Jeremiah's post,


  *   ASHRAE 90.1 does not require thermal bridging to be modeled in the baseline.
Thermal bridging should also be taken into account when calculating wall and floor U Values. External un-insulated assemblies must be explicitly modeled.

  *   ASHRAE 90.1 does not require internal mass to be modeled in the baseline.
I don't think any internal constructions are addressed in 90.1. Generally the effect of any internal walls will be negligible compared to the external walls unless your typical wall is heavy weight like a concrete block wall. Some schools are like this. Either way I would say internal mass would not need to be included in the baseline since the baseline is a metal framed building, which implies GWB internal walls.

  *   ASHRAE 90.1 does not require self shading to be modeled in the baseline.
  *   ASHRAE 90.1 requires a light weight wall assembly for the baseline.
The baseline should used a metal framed wall, which still has some mass effects that are required to be modeled. The way I understand it, a "light weight" wall refers to neglecting the mass effects of walls in your calculations.

Hi everyone,

I'm wondering how best to simplify a model when considering structural concrete columns.
My modelling is in the context of the LEED whole building energy modelling. So I'm concerned with accuracy as much as acceptability by the LEED reviewers. I've read the ASHRAE 90.1 user's manual but didn't find a satisfactory answer.
Here's an example:

        ----
wall   |    | wall
-------|    |------
       |    |
        ----
   concrete column

I can see 3 options for simplifying, each with its own issues:

1. Make the external surface of the column at the same level of the surrounding walls and model the column surface as having its true thickness . The issue is that it alters the area of the space inside and doesn't account for the shading effect of the column.

2. Follow the internal boundary of the column, which introduces 3 surfaces. Not sure what construction thickness to assign to these surfaces. This preserves the internal space area but alters the shading effect of the column.

3. Follow the external boundary of the column. This also introduces 3 surfaces. Not sure what construction thickness to assign to these surfaces either. It preserves the shading effect of the column but alters the area of the internal space.

I'm leaning towards option 1. What do you think? Are they other better options I overlooked?

Of course, things get a bit more complicated when the walls either side are not aligned or in the same plan...

Thanks!
Patrick

Hi Patrick,

Another choice is to use a tool like Therm to calculate the u-value of a typical section of your wall assembly and then create a uniform wall with that average u-value.  This is an acceptable strategy for a whole building energy model for LEED.  You can make it more complicated but it probably won't change the outcome unless you're also carefully calibrating the interior surface massing, furniture massing, interior surface reflectance and emittance values and using custom glazing performance data.

Most modeling software also has the ability to enter a window setback that will allow you to account for the shading of the column projections, or you can just add fins to the windows to pick up this shading effect.

Using the ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix A assembly u-value tables is the easiest way to factor in thermal bridging effects when creating external wall constructions because they are already factored in.   If you're in CA, the same Title 24 tables have very different results so just be aware their isn't agreement on the magnitude of those effects.

Generally the effect of any internal walls will be negligible compared to the external walls unless your typical wall is heavy weight like a concrete block wall. Some schools are like this. Either way I would say internal mass would not need to be included in the baseline since the baseline is a metal framed building, which implies GWB internal walls.

Internal surface properties including massing and furniture massing can have a big impact on how a model performs.   Some modeling software does a good job of defaulting these inputs but other tools don't do such a good job.  The result of not accounting for these effects is that a very high fraction of solar and thermal load inputs are assumed to directly impact the space air temperature each time step rather than being absorbed and retransmitted in a future time step.  This becomes most obvious if you build a simple single zone model and turn off the HVAC system after a certain period of time and look at the space temperature response over a multi day period.  Without calibration of interior massing you can get very large (>50 degree) diurnal space temperature swings that would never be possible outside of "Model World". 

From an ASHRAE 90.1 modeling perspective unless a specific baseline condition is specified the baseline inputs should be the same as in the proposed design.  The proper way to deal with internal mass is to model it the same in both models.  If treating it as an efficiency measure it should be run as an exception calc since no explicit baseline condition is specified.

I disagree with your understanding of light weight.  You should always take into account mass effects of walls in a model. Light weight just means thermal transmission of loads happens over a shorter time period (1-3 hrs) compared to heavier weight constructions that pass a given thermal load over a longer time period (6-8 hrs).  Some modeling software will show you a plot of how the different construction assemblies you create will transmit thermal loads on an hourly basis which is useful for communicating these differences.

per the 179d guidelines use the 2001 fan power allowance.  remember your 
actual tax building model (i.e. proposed in the leed world) is supposed 
to reflect actually site measured power consumed by the units.  i.e. 
volts x amps x pf (pf = power factor).  (or volts x amps x pf x sqrt(3) 
for 3 phase equipment).  the reality is that the fan will be using less 
power than the nameplate or catalog (good for your simulation savings) 
but the kicker is trying to find the pf values for motors.

FYI.

ASHRAE RP1468, just finished, which provides BIM-to-thermal modeling examples, contains example modeling DOE2 input files and BIM files for concrete thermal bridging, and  other examples like curved windows, etc.

The final report can be I obtained from Mike Vaughn at ASHRAE.

Hi everyone,

I'm wondering how best to simplify a model when considering structural concrete columns.
My modelling is in the context of the LEED whole building energy modelling. So I'm concerned with accuracy as much as acceptability by the LEED reviewers. I've read the ASHRAE 90.1 user's manual but didn't find a satisfactory answer.

Here's an example:

        ----
wall   |    | wall
-------|    |------
       |    |
        ----
   concrete column

I can see 3 options for simplifying, each with its own issues:

1. Make the external surface of the column at the same level of the surrounding walls and model the column surface as having its true thickness . The issue is that it alters the area of the space inside and doesn't account for the shading effect of the column.

2. Follow the internal boundary of the column, which introduces 3 surfaces. Not sure what construction thickness to assign to these surfaces. This preserves the internal space area but alters the shading effect of the column.

3. Follow the external boundary of the column. This also introduces 3 surfaces. Not sure what construction thickness to assign to these surfaces either. It preserves the shading effect of the column but alters the area of the internal space.

I'm leaning towards option 1. What do you think? Are they other better options I overlooked?

Of course, things get a bit more complicated when the walls either side are not aligned or in the same plan...

Thanks!

Patrick,

I wouldn't worry about the construction thickness, this has little bearing on the overall energy consumption. Any energy model is an estimation of the actual geometry and if it's out by 1% on floor area it's not going to be significant overall. Ensure any shading effects on windows are picked up (Some software allows you to do this with a shading device object, others might need it specified in the window setup) and that the overall area weighted U-value for your wall, including the concrete column areas is correct. Ensure your baseline is modelled in a consistent way and the LEED reviewers won't have anything to question. It's when you try to gain unfair advantage that they will have an issue.

Hope that helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling simplification for structural concrete columns

Hi everyone,

I'm wondering how best to simplify a model when considering structural concrete columns.
My modelling is in the context of the LEED whole building energy modelling. So I'm concerned with accuracy as much as acceptability by the LEED reviewers. I've read the ASHRAE 90.1 user's manual but didn't find a satisfactory answer.
Here's an example:

        ----
wall   |    | wall
-------|    |------
       |    |
        ----
   concrete column

I can see 3 options for simplifying, each with its own issues:

1. Make the external surface of the column at the same level of the surrounding walls and model the column surface as having its true thickness . The issue is that it alters the area of the space inside and doesn't account for the shading effect of the column.

2. Follow the internal boundary of the column, which introduces 3 surfaces. Not sure what construction thickness to assign to these surfaces. This preserves the internal space area but alters the shading effect of the column.

3. Follow the external boundary of the column. This also introduces 3 surfaces. Not sure what construction thickness to assign to these surfaces either. It preserves the shading effect of the column but alters the area of the internal space.

I'm leaning towards option 1. What do you think? Are they other better options I overlooked?

Of course, things get a bit more complicated when the walls either side are not aligned or in the same plan...

Thanks!
Patrick

Patrick,

I frankly think that you're looking at the modeling of building geometry 
in simulation programs too literally.  Please keep in mind that in the 
end all
the simulation programs are just doing hundreds of one-dimensional heat 
flow calculations through thousands of time steps.  Wall thickness is needed
only to compute the heat flow characteristics (U-value, response factor, 
transfer function, etc.) but is not modeled explicitly in the 
simulation, i.e.,
walls have no thickness in the simulations.  Similarly, the space volume 
is used only to determine the amount of air participating in the space 
heat balance, so therefore you should always input the actual enclosed 
volume, even if it does jive with the dimensions of the enclosing 
surfaces.  If you're concerned about the shading effect of the columns, 
they can be model them as narrow vertical building shades with widths 
equal to the protruding part of the columns, but if the walls are 
opaque, the effect must be extremely small.

However, I think you're ignoring  what I think is the most significant 
heat transfer aspect of these columns, which is the two-dimensional 
conduction through them, because the columns act like stubby fins on the 
wall, particularly if they're solid concrete with no insulation.  That's 
where I would concentrate my energies if I wanted to get the modeling right.

To do that, you would really have to model the wall-column-wall assembly 
with a 2-D conduction program like THERM (available from LBNL), although 
that was written for modeling window frames and can only output a 
steady-state U-value.  I still have a 2-D conduction program written in 
Fortran called WALFERFN (sounds German, doesn't it ? but the acronym 
stands for WAll Finite Element Response Factor New :-) ) that I use to 
calculate response factors for composite walls, but that can only handle 
planar surfaces.

Sorry, caught a couple of typos, meant to write in the second paragraph, 
"...even if it doesn't jive.." and "they can be modeled..."

*         How many wind directions are required? Lawson and the BRE
DG520 suggest 12 but I have heard of 8 directions being used. There's a
big difference in processor/ post-processing time between the two.

 

*         How are the results from the CFD usually post-processed to
produce the acceptability criteria throughout the domain? Is it a case
of writing some kind of script for the postprocessor using weighting
functions based on the local wind data? Are there any examples or
guidance on this? 

 

*         Any guidance on suitable turbulence models for CFX?

 

*         Finally what wind speed is used for the actual modelling, I
assume the 10 year average speed then post processing takes account of
variation in local wind speed, peak gust etc?

 

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Try "cloud computing" for EnergyPlus
Message-ID: <770DA51B8CC79343A32830010D6E379A0AA37E@PJWXMB-0001L.LEC-ADMIN.dmu.ac.uk>

Dear all,

We have still spare capacities to accommodate more users on the jEPlus Simulation Server (JESS). Should you be using jEPlus, DesignBuilder, EP-Launch, GenOpt, or your own code running EnergyPlus simulations, it will be reasonably straightforward to hook up with the servers at De Montfort University and execute your jobs remotely. This will potentially give you a bit more computing power than that of your PC or laptop.

Setting up the link is fairly easy (I think!) All you need to do is downloading a small software package (the JESS Client) and letting us know that you want an account on JESS. This trial is completely free and no-obligation to you. The only hurdles are agreeing to those legal stuff ;-)

Here are the steps:

1.       Check out how it works: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jeplus/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:jess_service

2.       Log on to the jEPlus website and download the JESS Client (with EP-Launch Support) package. If you are not yet a user, please register here: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jeplus/wiki/doku.php?id=start&do=register (only your name and email is required)

3.       Send an email to jeplus.services at gmail.com<mailto:jeplus.services at gmail.com>, and request a JESS account.

4.       Depending on your simulation jobs, follow the relevant instructions on the website to set up the client.

5.       We will be quite happy to guide you through the process over a Skype call.

Should you need more information and help with setting up the connection, please feel free to contact us. Please also let us know of your concerns or your particular requirement. We will do our best to help you find a solution.

Best regards,

Yi

Joe, Edwin,

I take your point that I'm probably too literal in my attempt at modelling
the geometry of this wall.

Thanks for the collegial suggestion about THERM. It seems really good and
I'm pretty sure it's going to be useful to me further down the line.

The building I'm modelling is a tower with a square floor section of
1400m2. There are only a few uninsulated columns but they are relatively
big (1.2m wide, 2m deep) and spaced by 8m or 18m. It doesn't seem
appropriate to me to give an overall U-value to the assembly, spreading the
effect of the columns over such "long distances". I'd rather model the
columns as surfaces separate from the  surrounding walls, especially as
they are glazed curtain walls.

Patrick

Joe & Mike's advice to use THERM is something I would support to convert a two dimensional heat transfer problem into one dimensional properties which most energy simulations are based on.  We have good success with this method when looking at edge beams and band beams that in the past have not been continuously insulated and where the extended surface area is significantly different from the projected surface area.

I assume your column has insulation somewhere?  While in annual energy terms the effect of insulating would be call if not a negative effect due to reduced free cooling, the effects in winter could be quite problematic.  The column surface temperatures will be very cool in winter after a weekend and I doubt anyone could sit near them comfortably unless insulated or compensated in some way (temperature, radiant heating etc).

I have had a few projects over the year where band or edge beams between carparks and office spaces have not been continuously insulated.  We have taken IR gun surface temperature measurements, modelled in THERM, taken THERM results to develop IES inputs and simulated remedial measures successfully and quite accurately relative to what the simulation would suggest.

Not knowing your climate zone, you can run different scenarios (boundary conditions and materials) in THERM to get a feel as to whether you have a radiant temperature asymmetry issue in winter.

So comfort not energy will (or should) govern the need to insulate...

Regards,
Graham

Patrick,

Those are some mighty columns!

I think it depends on what you're trying to achieve with the model. If you're looking at radiant temperatures, local thermal comfort or similar, then I would agree that taking an area weighted approach is going to neglect important local differences due to thermal inertia and other factors. However, if you're looking at the energy use of the entire building, and it's conditioned 24 hours, or in a climate with negligible diurnal swing, or with limited thermal mass generally, I would still say that a simplified approach would give you results that are accurate enough. I concur with Joe on the point about thermal bridging. Particularly if the remainder if the fa?ade is insulated. Most construction inputs in energy modelling software don't accurately account for thermal bridging, so if you think they're going to be significant, then use a separate 2D calculation software and adjust your u-values appropriately.

That said, as they're relatively large and it's easy enough to divide up the walls into separate constructions, as it is with software like IES, then by all means model them separately and apply a different construction.

Much of the importance of the above is also dependant on the climate your build is in. E.g. Un-insulated concrete columns in a northern European climate are a terrible idea and will come with a big energy penalty. In warmer climates, their contribution to the overall energy of the building will be much smaller and your efforts on the accuracy of their modelling may be better spent looking at something like the fresh air or building leakage.

Ed

Edwin, Graham,

Thanks for your advice. I had initially misunderstood what Joe was actually
proposing to do to take two dimensional conduction into account in and in
the vicinity of the columns. I'll follow his and your suggestion. It will
be a good learning experience for me anyway.

To answer your questions about the climate zone, this building is in South
Vietnam, so hot and humid all year around with some small variations. The
columns won't be insulated and the building will be air-conditioned. A nice
thermal bridge but not as bad as in a cold climate. Sadly, this is not the
type of project where the energy modelling is informing the design much...

Hi guys

Thermal bridges and interstitial condensation can be just as much an issue
in hot humid climates as they are in cold. If there's am air leakage path
past the pillars then humid exterior air might infiltrate layers.

A bit off topic, sorry.

The thermal mass should also provide a decent benefit-- the reason I did
not mention THERM is that it will provide a bridged conductivity- yet will
not show the benefit of the mass. It would be nice if THERM could also
model the thermal storage potential of the mass. Potentially the thermal
storage energy benefits of the mass would be close to the energy loss of
the added conductivity from the mass...?

Message-ID: <CAOsOtVi0mZdGCFxhORSPR2syW+MXUdr=hS2omOa_mQTr9fn5wg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello eQuesters,

  I am trying to model a two pipe system with a demand operation loop for a
residential building in Maryland.  Currently, my two pipe system turns on
cooling when the zones are calling for cooling as expected, however it
never changes over to heating during the winter.  It is always either off,
or on very rare occasions cooling, resulting in high unmet heating hours.
 Can some one explain how the two pipe system determines when to change
from heating to cooling mode?

I've looked at the zones they are definitely below the heating throttling
range.  Does eQuest take a sum of the room loads on the loop to determine
to heat or to cool?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
Justin

I usually use a snap function to specify when the loop is in heating /
cooling:

 

 

 

By the way, I've modeled a few 2-pipe systems (in the DC area) before,
and it is nearly impossible to get the unmet load hours below 300 for
the average building (without significantly relaxing the thermostat
setpoints, or having supplemental heating/cooling systems).  Hopefully
you are not modeling this for LEED purposes!

I could model it as snap, but I would still get some unmet hours for
certain days.  So far modeling as demand operation seems to be satisfying
the thermostat settings in the summer, but I just can't figure out why
heating isn't turned on.  And the model does have to meet LEED
requirements.

Thermal bridges are rarely the same in hot-humid as they are in the cold. ?The difference in temperature between the design temperature and the thermostat set-temperature is significantly smaller so there is much less conduction. ?So, in a lot of instances it can be disregarded.

Justin,

"Demand" is not adapted to 2-pipe loops. You should use either "Snap" or "Scheduled".

Note that as James pointed out, it is very difficult to figure out the correct changeover period (if it exists!) when using a schedule.

I could model it as snap, but I would still get some unmet hours for certain days.  So far modeling as demand operation seems to be satisfying the thermostat settings in the summer, but I just can't figure out why heating isn't turned on.  And the model does have to meet LEED requirements.

I usually use a snap function to specify when the loop is in heating / cooling:

By the way, I've modeled a few 2-pipe systems (in the DC area) before, and it is nearly impossible to get the unmet load hours below 300 for the average building (without significantly relaxing the thermostat setpoints, or having supplemental heating/cooling systems).  Hopefully you are not modeling this for LEED purposes!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] 2 Pipe System Heating/Cooling Change Over

Hello eQuesters,

  I am trying to model a two pipe system with a demand operation loop for a residential building in Maryland.  Currently, my two pipe system turns on cooling when the zones are calling for cooling as expected, however it never changes over to heating during the winter.  It is always either off, or on very rare occasions cooling, resulting in high unmet heating hours.  Can some one explain how the two pipe system determines when to change from heating to cooling mode?

I've looked at the zones they are definitely below the heating throttling range.  Does eQuest take a sum of the room loads on the loop to determine to heat or to cool?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
Justin

Dear all:

If you have played with DIVA for Rhino in the past and would now like to learn how to do some parametric environmental performance wizardry in Grasshopper, have a look at an all day workshop offered by Jonnie Sargent, maker of the VIPER and SHADERADE components in DIVA, on April 12th in Brooklyn, New York . The workshop will be part of a two day Fa?ades Performance symposium at CityTech (http://facade.archpaper.com/ny2013/day-2-technology-workshops/).

Best,

Christoph

Chris,

I totally agree. Thermal bridging is an issue everywhere. My point was that in an energy model, the contribution of a thermal bridge to the overall energy mix of the building in hot climate will be much lower. You have to trust your facade consultant or architect has done his job!

Ed

To answer your questions about the climate zone, this building is in South Vietnam, so hot and humid all year around with some small variations. The columns won't be insulated and the building will be air-conditioned. A nice thermal bridge but not as bad as in a cold climate. Sadly, this is not the type of project where the energy modelling is informing the design much...

Patrick,

Those are some mighty columns!

I think it depends on what you?re trying to achieve with the model. If you?re looking at radiant temperatures, local thermal comfort or similar, then I would agree that taking an area weighted approach is going to neglect important local differences due to thermal inertia and other factors. However, if you?re looking at the energy use of the entire building, and it?s conditioned 24 hours, or in a climate with negligible diurnal swing, or with limited thermal mass generally, I would still say that a simplified approach would give you results that are accurate enough. I concur with Joe on the point about thermal bridging. Particularly if the remainder if the fa?ade is insulated. Most construction inputs in energy modelling software don?t accurately account for thermal bridging, so if you think they?re going to be significant, then use a separate 2D calculation software and adjust your u-values appropriately.

That said, as they?re relatively large and it?s easy enough to divide up the walls into separate constructions, as it is with software like IES, then by all means model them separately and apply a different construction.

Much of the importance of the above is also dependant on the climate your build is in. E.g. Un-insulated concrete columns in a northern European climate are a terrible idea and will come with a big energy penalty. In warmer climates, their contribution to the overall energy of the building will be much smaller and your efforts on the accuracy of their modelling may be better spent looking at something like the fresh air or building leakage.

I agree that the columns are unlikely to have a significant impact on the
energy model - even if they're quite big.

We just use THERM to work out an effective insulation thickness to account for bridging as well as extended surface area (greater than projected).  We keep the mass the same in the dynamic simulation so you get the effect of both provided you layer the insulation and other layers correctly around the mass ?
If insulation is non existent then things get trickier but I am guessing adjusting the conductivity of the concrete to get the same effective U-Value on a projected area basis in THERM won't be too far off depending on what is desired from the simulation ...

It has been a few years since I have used DOE-2.2 day to day.

I recall that the hours where loads (temperatures) not met are reported include any optimum start / night purge hours.  So if you have optimum start in your schedules you would typically get a few hundred hours reported even though conditions are being met during what we would call established building hours (i.e. hours when comfort conditions are expected).  As long as night purge / optimum start existed you would never be able to zero these hours.

I am unsure whether this has been tidied up in the most recent versions and I am also unsure whether it is across all SS reports.  If I recall correctly SS-R, SS-F and others were affected in this way.

Regards,
Graham

Currently, my two pipe system turns on cooling when the zones are calling for cooling as expected, however it never changes over to heating during the winter.

It's not an either-or situation, i.e., either use THERM or model the column as a 1-D layer 
with thermal mass.  It's both, use THERM to get a better conductivity, and then use that 
conductivity instead of the nominal  concrete conductivity in the 1-D layer.

Message-ID: <CAE4kNa7uY6aGcxdbmC9o97e5LU1=OwQTE8+TecRhEs+YTC1ftQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am currently doing daylighting simulation for LEED 2009, but  there
is always SquareFootage discrepancy of each room between my daylighting
modeling tool and the Revit model, it just can not be 100% the same with
the design model. But the leed requrire the SF of each room should be same
with the architecure drawings and daylighting report? Could anyone help me
with it, is there any allowance range for the simulation method for LEED
2009, which is not mentioned in the reference guide?

Thanks so much,

Te

Per the attached Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED V2-1, which is available
for free download from LEED On-line, page 30, it states that a 10% variance
for built up areas is allowed.

Hope this helps.

Different area conventions exist. For example, in the UK we have nett
lettable area and gross internal area. The former has partition thickness
subtracted whilst the latter doesn't. This can easily account for 10%
difference. I'm not sure what area convention revit defaults to (or even if
alternative conventions can be selected).

Te Qi,

If you're talking about LEED credit IEQ 8.1, I have noticed that reviewers only care if all of the credits that rely on "regularly occupied space" (ROS) are filled out the same, and that they add up to the building total sf.

It is very difficult to get the architect's numbers and the daylight simulation numbers to be exactly the same, so I usually just use their numbers (as long as they are within about 5% of mine) and report the % of each room that qualifies.

I suggest trying the www.LEEDuser.com forum since this forum is mostly about energy modeling.

Best,
Jill

Dear Claire,

*         How many wind directions are required? Lawson and the BRE
DG520 suggest 12 but I have heard of 8 directions being used. There's a
big difference in processor/ post-processing time between the two.

 

Depends if it goes to public enquiry, I had to revise my 8 directions to
16. Remember wind tunnel guys will probably do at least 16, possibly
more so you are contending with them.

 

*         How are the results from the CFD usually post-processed to
produce the acceptability criteria throughout the domain? Is it a case
of writing some kind of script for the postprocessor using weighting
functions based on the local wind data? Are there any examples or
guidance on this? 

 

Statistical analysis based on ESDU criteria (this is something you need
to purchase) and the book by lawson. You will need to insert notional
monitoring points in all the key locations where you expect issues to
occur and post process based on those points. Typically around 25 to 30
locations minimum. In a wind tunnel they will pick these locations and
insert Irwin probes or similar to monitor the conditions at those
points. 

 

The ESDU criteria also tells you how to set up the upstream wind profile
based on a desktop analysis of what is even further upstream. 

 

*         Any guidance on suitable turbulence models for CFX?

 

At least 2 equation model k-E, the real issue is that you are probably
doing steady state and therefore not accounting for gusts. The wind
tunnel guys will pick on this aspect here.

 

*         Finally what wind speed is used for the actual modelling, I
assume the 10 year average speed then post processing takes account of
variation in local wind speed, peak gust etc?

 

>From memory i think i used 5m/s at 10m height, corrected by ESDU
profile. It really doesn't matter too much as the results you get for
5m/s need to be correlated to your weather file (8760 entries) for the
nearest location. Also, there are several Lawson criteria that are in
play, and i think one set was called CDDC or DDC or something similar
which related to projects in canary wharf area only. Don't use this
criteria. I would do a google search on wind studies for various
council's / local gov agencies and see what criteria they used. 

 

The wind tunnel players in UK are BRE, RWDI and BMT. If you find their
submissions online you will see what they have used. PS - they are not
in agreement with each other!!

 

Best of luck...

 

Tariq.

I need to carry out a Pedestrian wind comfort (Lawson) Assessment using
ANSYS CFX, I'm reading 'Wind Effects on Buildings' and the Franke et al
paper etc. but it's still not entirely clear to me. If you have any
guidance that would be great, particularly:

Hi all,

Is there any CBECS-like database for countries other than the US and UK?
I'm particularly interested in Australia. I vaguely remember there is a
database for Canada but don't remember its name.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How to model a New Building with an Existing District
	Cooling Plant
Message-ID: <CAMdiMCKhPDE1XdS_bRxtbZrit89dpxFRRr6aph9Qe+0sZfavYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I am trying to get an idea of how to model a new mixed use building (Office
+ retail) with a existing district cooling plant  serving other office
buildings on the site for LEED purposes.
Since it is a district cooling system, the plant  load, efficiency ,
performance and operation is dependent on the other existing buildings on
the site as well. I am not sure how to separate the energy metrics in the
model  for the plant associated with the  new proposed building.

1.Does the baseline building model also has to take into consideration the
existing plant in simulation or the baseline will be just modeled is it
will be for a new building with the plant type being decided by the
conditioned square footage of the new proposed building?
2. When modeling the proposed building, do i neglect the effects of other
building on the district cooling plant performance and use the part load
efficiency curves and load shedding schedules for the plant equipments (
towers, pumps, Chillers) as if they were serving only the new proposed
building? has anyone done a model like this and how does the LEED
guidelines approach this issue?

The simulation community help is much appreciated.
Please respond if you have any questions as well.

There is a guide that ASHRAE/LEED uses to model the district cooling
plants.  There is two methods to utilize, and each have their benefits and
constraints.  It is mentioned where to find it in the LEED manual and in
the most recent EAp2 Table 1.4 downloads.

Hope this helps,

nabers.gov.au but not all ratings are disclosed on the website and it is a voluntary system so not all the market.
For commercial office buildings only current Building Energy Efficiency Certificates can be views under Commercial Building Disclosure, http://www.cbd.gov.au/FindBEEC.aspx.  If an owner / lessor is selling a building or leasing space they must disclose its performance to prospective buyers / tenants.  So it should show all assets that are seeking buyers, tenants, but wouldn't show assets that are fully leased or not up for sale.  There are also some exemptions and I think the size threshold is 2,500 m2 and above.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Optimizing a DOAS
Message-ID: <3E0EBBB7260AE24CB0962ECC6B83903401C1EBAC@THEWHO.michaelsengineering.local>

All,

I?m working on a retrocomissioning project trying to optimize a DOAS system as best as I can. This particular system has (in this order) an enthalpy wheel, preheating steam coil, cooling coil, sensible wheel, and heating coil. Downstream there are 4-pipe fan coil units. Hot water is provided by a steam to hot water converter and a chiller with a closed circuit tower that can be switched over to free cooling when ambient conditions allow.

I?ve made myself an excel model, which has worked to some extent, but when I want to ask some of the more challenging questions it?s going to require a not-so-modest commitment to developing it (and circular references are driving me nuts). I?m fairly confident I can?t do what I want to do with DOE2 (with which I?m most familiar). Is E+ capable of modeling to this level of detail? Some of the types of questions I?d like answers to:


?         When it?s extremely hot outside and the enthalpy wheel and cooling coil are running to dehumidify, is it more efficient to run the sensible wheel (near) full speed (thus lowering the exhaust temperature, allowing some additional cooling from the enthalpy wheel, and lowering the cooling coil load) or to do more modest reheating to balance the downstream cooling and heating demands? My gut says it?s going to be best to run the sensible wheel only as fast as is necessary to keep all the downstream heating coils closed, but I?d like some numbers.

?         When temperatures are mild, but not sufficient for full water-side free cooling, what?s the right balance between the enthalpy wheel and terminal cooling and heating? Is the chiller operating at a part load that?s more cost effective than the heating, and how does the enthalpy wheel strike the right balance? Is there a sequence that is optimum, or would it be something that needs to be continually optimized by the controls system?

Obviously I?d need to go up the E+ learning curve, but I think that?s something I?ll need to do eventually (unless the fabled DOE2.3 engine comes out and can do this type of thing), so if it?s between that and continuing to develop a complicated excel model, it may be worth it for me. I just don?t want to go down that path only to find out I can?t get some of the answers I?m looking for?

Any thoughts (or references) are appreciated.

Cheers,

Amit,

There's a fairly comprehensive document, "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2 and LEED 2009 - Design & Construction," which explains the options available to you, of which there are three:


*         Measurement of existing plant to determine efficiencies

*         Simulation of existing plant with existing building to determine efficiencies

*         If data is unavailable for the above 2 options, then defaults are allowed.

You model your baseline building as a normal standalone building, with the relevant chiller plant for the climate zone etc. Let me know if you can't find a copy of the guide and I'll send one over.

Regards,
Ed

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How to model a New Building with an Existing District Cooling Plant

Hi all,
I am trying to get an idea of how to model a new mixed use building (Office + retail) with a existing district cooling plant  serving other office buildings on the site for LEED purposes.
Since it is a district cooling system, the plant  load, efficiency , performance and operation is dependent on the other existing buildings on the site as well. I am not sure how to separate the energy metrics in the model  for the plant associated with the  new proposed building.

1.Does the baseline building model also has to take into consideration the existing plant in simulation or the baseline will be just modeled is it will be for a new building with the plant type being decided by the conditioned square footage of the new proposed building?
2. When modeling the proposed building, do i neglect the effects of other building on the district cooling plant performance and use the part load efficiency curves and load shedding schedules for the plant equipments ( towers, pumps, Chillers) as if they were serving only the new proposed building? has anyone done a model like this and how does the LEED guidelines approach this issue?

The simulation community help is much appreciated.
Please respond if you have any questions as well.

Eric,
I have been looking at similar situations in our warm and humid climate for
about three years trying to optimize both DX and water cooled heat pump
DOAS with various combinations of heat recovery (sensible and total) and
have not found anything that can do a very good job of analyzing these
units under all oa conditions and varying return/exhaust air conditions.
I've played around with a spreadsheet solution as well using TMY3 weather
data for all 8760 hours and columns for heat transfer/temperature/humidity
across each device node in the process at each oa condition with fixed
return/exhaust conditions.
I will be very interested to hear/see if we get many responses to this.
These units are a big portion of the energy consumption in k-12 schools and
institutional occupancies in the warm and humid southeast. Thanks for
kicking this discussion off.

Dear Eric,
I know enough to be dangerous with EnergyPlus and can say this much:

*         Your questions are good ones about DOAS operation.  They can be very complex and all of the details you mention have an impact.

*         Don't forget the impact of all that pressure drop for various coil and heat exchanger components.  I modeled something in E+ with similar complexity (indirect evap cooling with economizer, heating and DX coil) not long ago and found that using a constant speed fan for variable airflow loads negated most of the savings for some climates.  VSD fans proved to make a big difference.

*         Energy Plus can probably model anything you wish, especially when you include its EMS capability.  That does not mean it's easy!  DesignBuilder and Simergy are making the learning curve become easier, but it is still no small task.

*         Finally, I know that Semco has a bin-based spreadsheet which is used for modeling performance of their equipment with both single and double energy recovery wheels and almost any heating / cooling configuration you might like.  Consider checking in with your local rep.  I have used that in the past and it's pretty thorough for constant airflow applications.

With Excel you can enable circular references to enable the calculations to converge.  If you have 8760 rows then you can also run a simple macro to reseed a column with a calculated result so you in effect get convergence.

One challenge with these types of systems is what is optimal under one set of ambient and internal conditions may not be as optimal in another set of conditions.  So coming up with one set of controls will not optimise for all conditions.  None of the software that I have used over the years would allow you to properly have different controls for different ambient conditions.  So testing one set of controls and looking at annual results you would lose what is really happening under different conditions unless you look at hourly results but then your ability to adjust controls for different conditions is limited unless you go to something more open and flexible.

At the end of the day being able to model different controls would be useful to understand what the sensitivity and thus opportunity or risk is.  If the differences are small then there is a strong argument to keep it simple and find that balance of simplicity and efficiency so that long term efficiency can be sustained rather than having something no one knows how to fix or operate ...

Graham

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Optimizing a DOAS
Message-ID: <89136dc4cadd48ce9629bf7c7dd43476@BLUPR06MB049.namprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Part of the attraction of the DOAS system with the fan-coil units is to reduce the amount of reheat needed in the building. You would have to be very efficient to provide simultaneous heating and cooling in a way that uses less energy than eliminating the simultaneous heating and cooling.

Generally you will be better off when you can reduce a load, rather than trying to provide that load through use of extra equipment. Understanding that the ability to program the sequence may not be infinite either, I think you are correct with your first thought to use the energy recovery equipment at little as possible while eliminating the need for reheat.

I?m not sure if I understand your second item about the chiller, but I think the same thought applies. Do you mean that the energy recovery system would false load the chiller to make it operate more efficiently, but at a higher load? The change in efficiency would have to be pretty dramatic to offset the additional MMBtu. Maybe there is some combination where it works out.

The other thought I had was if the control system has enough flexibility in the sequence of operations to account for some of the less frequent conditions. Particularly if the building operators are hands-on, it could be better to have a generically efficient scheme which might miss on a few infrequent conditions but over the course of the year provides a reliable energy savings.

Have you looked at TRNSYS as an option to simulate the components? Many of the flexibilities of EnergyPlus, but without the need to model the whole building. Unless you were going to model the building anyway.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Optimizing a DOAS

All,

I?m working on a retrocomissioning project trying to optimize a DOAS system as best as I can. This particular system has (in this order) an enthalpy wheel, preheating steam coil, cooling coil, sensible wheel, and heating coil. Downstream there are 4-pipe fan coil units. Hot water is provided by a steam to hot water converter and a chiller with a closed circuit tower that can be switched over to free cooling when ambient conditions allow.

I?ve made myself an excel model, which has worked to some extent, but when I want to ask some of the more challenging questions it?s going to require a not-so-modest commitment to developing it (and circular references are driving me nuts). I?m fairly confident I can?t do what I want to do with DOE2 (with which I?m most familiar). Is E+ capable of modeling to this level of detail? Some of the types of questions I?d like answers to:


?         When it?s extremely hot outside and the enthalpy wheel and cooling coil are running to dehumidify, is it more efficient to run the sensible wheel (near) full speed (thus lowering the exhaust temperature, allowing some additional cooling from the enthalpy wheel, and lowering the cooling coil load) or to do more modest reheating to balance the downstream cooling and heating demands? My gut says it?s going to be best to run the sensible wheel only as fast as is necessary to keep all the downstream heating coils closed, but I?d like some numbers.

?         When temperatures are mild, but not sufficient for full water-side free cooling, what?s the right balance between the enthalpy wheel and terminal cooling and heating? Is the chiller operating at a part load that?s more cost effective than the heating, and how does the enthalpy wheel strike the right balance? Is there a sequence that is optimum, or would it be something that needs to be continually optimized by the controls system?

Obviously I?d need to go up the E+ learning curve, but I think that?s something I?ll need to do eventually (unless the fabled DOE2.3 engine comes out and can do this type of thing), so if it?s between that and continuing to develop a complicated excel model, it may be worth it for me. I just don?t want to go down that path only to find out I can?t get some of the answers I?m looking for?

Any thoughts (or references) are appreciated.

Cheers,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Symposium on Sustainable Urban Design @ MIT
Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E800FE64FE9@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues,

Over the next two decades, the UN expects that we need to accommodate new homes for 1.7 billion city dwellers. There is an undeniable need for concepts and solutions that lead to more sustainable urban growth, concepts that work across a range of climates and cultures. What are those solutions? Are there good examples? How can we evaluate them on a large scale? What role can computer based environmental performance analysis play in this context?

It is my pleasure to invite you to an all-day symposium on Sustainable Urban Design - Case Studies and Design Workflows<http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/projects/SustainableUrbanDesignSymposium> on May 6th 2013 at MIT. The symposium is supported by the MIT Energy Initiative, MIT's new Center for Advanced Urbanism and the German American Chamber of Commerce Inc. During the morning session speakers from practice and academia will present examples and workflows of how to implement measures of sustainability in their projects. During the afternoon session we will be presenting Umi<http://urbanmodellinginterface.ning.com/>, our new urban modeling platform to evaluate operational energy use, daylighting, outdoor comfort and walkability at the neighborhood level. Umi has been extensively used in two graduate level classes at MIT and Harvard and student projects resulting from these classes will be presented in a poster sessions in the late afternoon. During the closing discussion we hope to develop a better understanding of the role computational design tools may play in the transition to more sustainable urban planning practices.

If you decide to attend, please RSVP<http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/projects/SustainableUrbanDesignSymposium/rsvp.html> by April 15th.

Best regards,

Christoph

Khristiam,

Is it possible that your space has extremely high latent (moisture) loads?
Your results would indicate an SHR (Sensible Heat Ratio) of only around 0.5,
which doesn't seem typical for office occupancies.

e.g., 300 cfm would give a sensible cooling of around 6600 Btu/h.  SHR =
6600/12000 = 0.55.

Dear Sirs

I made a simulation of two one floor building for offices.
The results indicate the following:
Area / Sypply / Design Capacity
2810 sqft / 3974 cfm / 271cfm/ton
1017 swft / 1306 cfm / 302cfm/ton

Why the software gives these results so differente from the usual rule
of thumb 400cfm/ton?

Thank you very much.

Hello everyone,

I'm a new user to Energy Plus and am trying to work through a simple model using the HVAC Templates.  The configuration is a packaged VAV system with hot water loop and NG boiler, with heating cooling and airflows autosized.

My simulation is not running as it is giving me the following error:
"CheckEnvironmentSpecifications: Sizing for Zones has been requested but there are no design environments specified."  The same is given for system and plant objects.

I was under the impression from the I/O reference that the EXPIDF processor takes care of this and that these objects shouldn't be entered.  This seems to work for several of the example files as well (they do not define sizing, but do autosize).  What could I not be specifying, or specifying incorrectly to get this error? If I check No for Sizing Calcs under SimulationControl it also doesn't like this and will ask this to be checked as yes, so either way I don't know how to get around it.  IDF is attached.

Thanks,

Adam Barker

It's asking for design environments, or design days.  In the examples, 
you should see some SizingPeriod:DesignDay objects.  You will need to 
add similar objects for your location.  If you are using one of the 
standard EnergyPlus weather file locations, there is a ddy file included 
with the epw weather that contains all of the standard ASHRAE design 
days in EnergyPlus format.  Just copy/paste the desired design days from 
the ddy to your idf.

Adam,

You might get more response if you post your question to the EnergyPlus_Support bulletin 
board, which is focused specifically on EnergyPlus issues.

I think what's happening is that you've not specified any Design Days  
(SizingPeriod:DesignDay), so EnergyPlus doesn't know what to use for the design 
calculations.  Please note that "autosizing" works differently between EnergyPlus and 
DOE-2.  In DOE-2, it means that the program figures out the peak load over the simulation 
period which it uses to then "size" the equipment.  In EnergyPlus, it means that, given 
the design day specifications, the program will calculate the equipment size.   To me, 
that always seems more like "sizing", not "autosizing".

Hi Adam,

E+ is looking for sizing objects. At the top of the IDF in "SimulationControl" you have said yes, you want zone sizing, system sizing and plant sizing.
[cid:image001.jpg at 01CE1697.0A3BB140]

You have two choices


1)      Put no next to each of these objects ie - Do zone sizing - no etc.. Make sure you say yes to Run simulation though.



2)      Add these sizing objects, they can be found about half way through the idf and are called Sizing:zone, Sizing:System, Sizing:Plant


As far as I remember when you use the templates you do not need to specify these sizings so just changing SimulationControl to no for those areas will probably work

Good luck

Annie

My simulation is not running as it is giving me the following error:

"CheckEnvironmentSpecifications: Sizing for Zones has been requested but there are no design environments specified."  The same is given for system and plant objects.



I was under the impression from the I/O reference that the EXPIDF processor takes care of this and that these objects shouldn't be entered.

      Simergy Public Beta 2 posted

A second public beta version of the Simergy free graphical user 
interface for EnergyPlus has been posted at 
http://simergy-beta.lbl.gov/.  Key features of Simergy include:

- Comprehensive and Loop Level HVAC System Templates for typical and 
high performance systems
- Drag and drop component-level editing of HVAC systems to adapt 
templates and build custom systems
- Geometry options:
     - import of building geometry from 3D CAD/BIM using IFC or gbXML
     - build custom geometry from 2D plans (dwg/dxf) or draw free form 
and extrude vertically
     - build your own geometry from base shapes
- Management of multiple design alternatives
- Pre-defined reports and interactive visualization of EnergyPlus output
- Training and support documentation including links to EnergyPlus 
documentation.

It is worth going through the 1 page Essential Reading included as part 
of the installation before using Simergy.

*Contest!

This data is way better than I can get, Aaron.  I don't know the CFMs 
these fans move, but for me it is normal to see the smallest H.P. for 
the smallest 1.5 / 2 ton fan coil at 1/5 H.P.  Seeing something lower 
than that would be a godsend.  Who made these fans and how much air do 
they move? Typically the fan coil manufacturers that I work with don't 
bother giving fan H.P. (listed on your chart as Motor H.P.?) but rather 
jump right to the motor nominal H.P. which is always higher.

But I agree with you regarding amps.  Typically the amps are much higher 
than the corresponding H.P. for unknown reasons.  Startup current?  
Perhaps...

I also note that your data has higher watts at higher voltages in some 
cases, for unknown reasons, along with "peak" watts at 208/230 in other 
cases.  I can't explain that.

Thanks for sending this, but if you can identify the manufacturer and 
the product, I would be very grateful.


Cheers!

Dear,

As for the whole of Europe, also in France performance evaluation tools
have been developped according to the EU directive.
I am trying to see how new innovative technologies can be implemented in
France. Generally they have to pass specific tests and can receive a
certification if the quality is high enough.

Could anyone provide me further information on this certification procedure?

Thanks a lot,

Robert,

 

I was looking at the engineering manual for JCI fan-coil units,
http://bit.ly/YPtNcH.  They say "Fan Coil Units are equipped with permanent
split-capacitor (PSC) motors with three taps (High, Medium and Low) which
provides variable horsepower outputs."  So I understand the "Motor HP"
listed in the table below is output HP.  I'm not sure why the watts were
sometimes higher for higher voltages; they're generally pretty consistent
except for the size 20.

 

In another table they also list the power input for various configurations
at ARI conditions with airflow indicated.  They're generally around 0.3
W/cfm which sounds good to me but that's at 0" or 0.05" ESP which I think is
unrealistic for a ducted system.  At least the airflow is indicated and they
have the fan curves.

 

Regards,
Aaron

fans move, but for me it is normal to see the smallest H.P. for the smallest
1.5 / 2 ton fan coil at 1/5 H.P.  Seeing something lower than that would be
a godsend.  Who made these fans and how much air do they move?  Typically
the fan coil manufacturers that I work with don't bother giving fan H.P.
(listed on your chart as Motor H.P.?) but rather jump right to the motor
nominal H.P. which is always higher.

But I agree with you regarding amps.  Typically the amps are much higher
than the corresponding H.P. for unknown reasons.  Startup current?
Perhaps...

I also note that your data has higher watts at higher voltages in some
cases, for unknown reasons, along with "peak" watts at 208/230 in other
cases.  I can't explain that.

Thanks for sending this, but if you can identify the manufacturer and the
product, I would be very grateful.


Cheers!

Robert,

 

I've also run into problems obtaining combined (fan and motor) efficiency
and input power, mostly with terminal units such as heat pumps and fan coil
units but also with individual fans.  What I've often done is used the watts
listed in their electrical tables.  For example, below if you take their
size 20 at high fan speed, they classify the motor HP at 1/30HP or 25W
(output power).  I've taken the subsequent columns to mean input power so
the watts at 115V is then 57W which would make the motor is 44% efficient
and that seems reasonable to me.  The listed amps don't necessarily equate
to the same wattages, they are usually higher so my only theory is that this
is the starting amps.  

 

I'd be interested in finding out what other have to say.  I have tried
talking to some local equipment reps without any luck.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fan Power

 

This is a DOE-2 question, I think, but I am applying it to EnergyPro.  I 

am asking here in the hopes that some will have a more in-depth 

knowledge of DOE-2 and how it relates to fan power.  I am also hoping 

that some here will be able to reflect on the theory and application of 

fan power and energy as it relates to actual systems and modeling.

 

When inputting indoor fan power, I have used many sources for the fan 

power.  I sometimes use the motor nameplate, which I believe is too high 

in every case.

 

I also sometimes use FLA or RLA, which I also do not believe are 

accurate, but sometimes give more realistic numbers.

 

Some manufacturers give fan BHP at design conditions, which I find to be 

very helpful, but not everybody is that helpful.

 

It has been suggested that I calculate the fan BHP using the theoretical 

formula *** Fan BHP = (cfm x static press "w.c.) / (6356 x fan 

efficiency) *** and then use a conservative fan efficiency (maybe 50%) 

for a good number.  This gives a much lower value than the other 

methods, and I am trying to see if there is anything wrong with this 

approach.

 

As I understand the usage, indoor fan power is divided by motor and 

drive efficiency to come up with fan energy.  So the fan BHP is the 

starting point.  Having this too high drives up fan energy, sometimes 

dramatically, and can influence the proposed case quite a bit if there 

are lots of fans, even small fans.

 

 

Any thoughts on this approach would be very much appreciated.

Thanks Aaron,

That's very helpful.  I had looked at the Johnson units before and been 
distracted by their not having obvious DX ratings, seeming to have more 
on water loops than DX loops, but they do say that they provide DX coils 
too.

Thanks again!

You should check with the design team to see what the governing codes are from the local authorities. In terms of ASHRAE references, 2011 Handbook of Applications Chapter 8 or Standard 170 will take precedence over ASHRAE 62.1, since the criteria in this case is for infection control purposes which goes beyond the comfort requirements in 62.1. There are a number of other references that the design team might be using. These might include the client?s own design standards which may be even higher than the regulatory requirements.

Regarding your prior post about the reheat ? it will be a significant quantity, this is typical. However for reheat to be higher than the cooling end-use during a peak summer month should be reviewed. Assuming your location has economizer hours in the winter, the reheat could easily be higher than the cooling on an annual basis unless the design is including measures to reduce the need for reheat.

This is a timely subject.  I have been working on 
some very large distribution warehouses.  The 
staff are never all in one place at one time 
except morning, breaks and the end off 
shift.  The local authorities are asking that 
ASHRAE 62.1 be followed - warehouses at 0.06 
cfm/sf.  A half million square foot warehouse 
ends up with a lot of out door air that needs to 
be conditioned, especially in summer to remove 
the latent load.  I went through the Handbook of 
Applications and the Industrial Ventilation 
reference manual but found no guidance that would 
allow the OA to be lower than that value.

When one considers that over 3/4 of that space is 
solid from floor to ceiling with the stacks of 
crates, boxes etc.  it seems a very large amount 
of outdoor air for the floor space that is no "solid".

Does anyone have experience with this sort of 
facility and reducing outdoor air levels below that 0.06 cfm/sf.

Dear all,

For a non-residential building in California, I am assessing the possibility of including the electricity produced by a PV System in my energy consumption of my proposed building.

Do we know if this is possible, to balance my Net-zero Energy building against the reference building?

My energy consumption balance without the PV System might exceed that of the reference building.

Any ideas if this will be included in the 2013 version of title 24?

Thanks in advance for your answers.

Dear Chris,
My understanding of the area ventilation requirement is concern for off-gassing of VOCs and similar chemicals which are deemed harmful.  It will be difficult to  avoid that requirement!
On the other hand, my experience with many warehouses and distribution centers is that it is very rare to have less than about 0.2 air changes per hour (average) from infiltration. For a 30 foot tall warehouse, that is equivalent to about 0.1 cfm / sq.ft.
The summary, assuming I did the math properly in a hurry, is that you?ll heat the 0.06 cfm/sq.ft. plus some more just for infiltration ? so nothing is ?wasted?.  Do you feel any better ??
p.s., Almost all of my warehouse experience is with heated-only facilities.  Perhaps the air conditioned facilities are better constructed, but I?m doubtful.

When one considers that over 3/4 of that space is solid from floor to ceiling with the stacks of crates, boxes etc.  it seems a very large amount of outdoor air for the floor space that is no "solid".

Does anyone have experience with this sort of facility and reducing outdoor air levels below that 0.06 cfm/sf.

You should check with the design team to see what the governing codes are from the local authorities. In terms of ASHRAE references, 2011 Handbook of Applications Chapter 8 or Standard 170 will take precedence over ASHRAE 62.1, since the criteria in this case is for infection control purposes which goes beyond the comfort requirements in 62.1. There are a number of other references that the design team might be using. These might include the client???s own design standards which may be even higher than the regulatory requirements.

Regarding your prior post about the reheat ? it will be a significant quantity, this is ttypical. However for reheat to be higher than the cooling end-use during a peak summer month should be reviewed. Assuming your location has economizer hours in the winter, the reheat could easily be higher than the cooling on an annual basis unless the design is including measures to reduce the need for reheat.

Hi All,
         Is there any ACPH  recommende value for operation theatre given in ASHRAE 62  standards It is 100% fresh air AHU . but the cfm sized  is very high 6cfm/sqft as per design and if i reduce it to 3cfm/sqft i am still not getting any discomfort hour.

California Title-24 Energy Compliance calculations do not allow any

electrical production.

Not at all.

It looks like the 2013 Standards will allow credit, but I don't know how 
much or how at the moment.

HI Chris,

I did design a refrigerated warehouse and did 
struggle with this (The warehouse was to be LEED 
certified and we had to meet ASHRAE 62.1)
The solution I found was to use the IAQ procedure 
in 62.1.  We calculate the contaminant, mosthly 
CO2 from people and arrive with a total cfm a lot 
smaller (20 cfm/person) than the ventilation rate procedure.

Imagine if we had to use 0.06 cfm/sqft, the 
refrigeration load would have been a lot higher.
After discussion with a lot of other refrigerated 
warehouse designer, the rarelly introduce fresh air.

Hope this help

Martin

Leen,

Barring places with geothermal hot spots, ground temperatures are calculated using a 
simple equation developed by the late Dr. Tamami Kusuda at NBS (National Bureau of 
Standards, now renames NIST National Institute of Science and Technology) in the early 
1970's that assumes a constant deep ground temperature of the average annual air 
temperature + 1 K. This equation is basically a sine curve that dampens and lags the 
annual air temperature profile depending on the soil conductivity and depth below the 
surface.

All that is worked out in any of the processed weather files, such as the IWEC2 weather 
files available from ASHRAE for $229 for the entire set of 3,012 or individually from my 
company for $35 a station.  For your location (Nador), the closest IWEC2 weather file is 
for Melilla 8 kilometers to the north, for which the monthly ground temperatures at 1 
meter below grade are:
16.7  15.7  15.6  16.1  18.0  19.9  21.5  22.6  22.6  21.8  20.2  18.4
(converted to Celsius from Rankine in DOE-2 *.BINM weather file for Melilla)

Thank you very much Robert.

I wonder, if I drive the chiller plant directly with the PV system, couldn't we argue that I can then draw my system boundary around Chiller+PV for a very efficient cooling system, i.e. solar cooling ...?

This efficient system would then reduce my energy consumption associated to cooling, no?

Kind regards
Nadir

Do we know if this is possible, to balance my Net-zero Energy building against the reference building?

My energy consumption balance without the PV System might exceed that of the reference building.

Any ideas if this will be included in the 2013 version of title 24?

As far as I know, Nadir, that argument won't work with CA Title-24

Nadir,

How is it that the energy consumption of your building might exceed that 
of the reference building?  Using PVs seems like a very expensive way to 
make a building code-compliant.

Robert

I'm not sure what climate you are designing for, but if it is heating-dominated I'd suggest you take a look at designing around devices such as the AmericanAldes CAR (Constant Air Regulator) flow control devices. Devices like these can provide a simple solution to preventing floor-to-floor stack effect issues (whose effects are not negligible in a high-rise located in a heating dominated climate) that exhaust systems will need to compensate for. If sized and installed correctly, they can mitigate odor migration (cooking, etc.) and allow an exhaust fan to actually be TAB/commissioned to the design flow and provide good pressure balance.

Couple that with AEROSEAL or similar technology applied to the exhaust risers, and I think you will have a best-in-class system that will serve the building well (no pun intended).

As far as 'design guides' - I' don't know if any specific pdf docs, etc. IMHO AmercianAldes website has a good document library you might want to check out.  I've had good experiences with my local Aldes rep in providing technical support as well.

All the Best,

Dear Joe,

I have the following concerns.

My (potentially and only formally badly performing) proposed building will not be a true representation of my (hopefully well performing, Net Zero Energy) real building as certain design features, according to my understanding, can not be considered in title 24 performance approach, e.g.:

-Exterior movable sun protection to ensure my 100% glazed fa?ade is sufficiently protected
-Solar protection by trees,
-increased daylight due to generous glazing
-geothermal cooling
-some more technologies successfully implemented in other countries but not mentioned in title 24 ...

The PV has actually nothing to do with this, we have them anyway to reach Net Zero. I just ask myself how we can formally represent our well performing building (again, irrespective of the PV) with a building that does not allow for the set of measures as suggested above.

Does this make sense?
Regards
Nadir, Transsolar

Robert,
I am assuming you are wanting to model them from an energy consumption
standpoint.  I am a fire protection engineer.  High rise building exhaust
systems have to be well coordinated with the building's smoke control
systems and requires close coordination with the adopted building and fire
codes.  That doesn't mean systems can't be designed for energy efficiency,
they just need fail safe controls that put them into very specific
sequences of operation once a smoke control event is triggered.  If
you Google "high rise building exhaust systems" you will get more than
enough current reading material on the subject to weed through.  I'd start
with some of the publications from the national labs and research based
articles.  There seems to be a fair amount of info on variable speed
systems in mid to high rise residential applications and historic
structures.  I do not design or study many systems for high rise buildings
so I do not have a specific reference to steer you toward.
Dennis

Nadir,

Have you actually done simulations to show that your proposed design 
fails to meet the Title-24 performance budget?  Title-24 is a minimum 
performance standard, so if your basic design without the extra features 
cannot meet Title-24, that would tell me there's something suboptimal 
about your design.  I don't see anything in the extra features you 
mentioned that necessitates nor benefits from a higher base load, so if 
you were to modify your design and make it compliant to Title-24, you 
may find the features to work even better, and further reduce the need 
for PV.

I am not a fan of 100% glazed facades, especially for sunny, mild to hot 
climates like in California.  Whenever I see an all-glazed building with 
elaborate movable shading, I always wonder why didn't the architect 
reduce the amount of glazing?  From the studies I've done, the trade-off 
between
daylighting and cooling loads peaks at about 20% WWR, beyond which 
cooling energy use increases more than lighting energy savings.

I haven't followed Title-24 too closely these days, but I do remember 
the reasons why the Energy Commission eliminated the credit for shading 
devices a long time ago - they found they were often not installed, can 
break, or were not used.  There must be similar concerns about trees.

I have a question about the fan power calculation used for 2001 epact
models.

 

The NREL guidelines say to use the 2001 fan power allowance instead of
appendix G. However, the 2001 guidelines are only for nameplate horsepower.
The nameplate requirements are actually the same in 2001 and 2004. 

 

COMNET says to use the formula bhp = nhp * eff_motor, then fan power (watts)
= (bhp * 746)/eff_motor

 

This comes out to fan power(watts) = nhp * 746

 

This doesn't seem to make sense to me. What have you guys been using for fan
power?

As part of the Advanced Design + Optimization (ADOPT) project, we held a Design Optimization Competition in Oct-Dec 2012 (see http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/content/view/135/206/).

The Competition attracted 201 participants from 37 countries/regions, and received 30 submissions from 12 countries by the closing date in December. We have now put all the finalists online, so you can analyse their designs and see if you can further improve the performance. The models and reports are here: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~adopt/wiki/doku.php?id=competition:submissions. Please feel free to leave comments on the submissions. To me, it is still a mystery how 018 and 214 achieved their low carbon emissions.

By the way, all models are in DesignBuilder format. The evaluation copy of DesignBuilder can view the models and existing simulation results even after the evaluation period has expired.

Cheers,

Message-ID: <C0C677C05CEF824C9DE8655599A3760DB847AE6D@exch01.adivl.ivl.se>

Dear all,
I like to model building energy use in an environment which does not limit me to pre-defined input data fields and keep code hidden in a black boxes. I like to have the option to go beyond the interface and be able to model odd design of buildings and HVAC solutions. However, I am not a computer programmer and why invent the entire wheel again. Therefor I look for a tool/environment which already has some building modules. I have been thinking about TRNSYS.
The Modelica language seems also very interesting. BERKELY lab has some building component library and moreover do I get the impression that Modelica is relatively easy to use and learn and do perhaps not require Master degree in programming to master.
Comments are welcome

Dear all,

Can anyone tell me what is the reference height of wind velocities used in weather files?

In some literature, the standard height is mentioned as 10m.

Does it change for different weather files from different sources?

I am using this value to calculate the surface resistance in a model calculation.

Thank you for your help.

Message-ID: <CAN1ZnDtw9HjxGBP8S5hJ0YsytoWD37PZQV718bD9x0Jy=mVmOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Join us *Tuesday, March 19* for the next meeting of the Rocky Mountain
Energy Simulation Engineers (RMESE). Five masters and PHD candidates from
the University of Colorado will have 15 minutes each to present on their
respective energy modeling projects for their research. The
presenters/presentations for the evening will be as follows:

*Neal Kruis*

How do you account for heat loss from your building foundation? Many energy
modelers either drastically simplify this heat loss in their models or
neglect it entirely. This is because the multi-dimensional, large-timescale
nature of foundation heat losses can become very computationally intensive,
to the point where it becomes time prohibitive for most modeling projects.

My research aims at answering several unanswered questions about foundation
heat loss:

?         How significant is foundation heat loss relative to other loads
in the building?

?         How good are our current tools at estimating these losses?

?         What can be done to improve theses estimations and reduce
computation time?

?         What are best practices for insulating building foundations?

*Anna Osborne*

A grant awarded to the International Center for Appropriate and Sustainable
Technology (ICAST) from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) is funding a study to assess the effect of energy
conservation measures (ECMs) and behavioral change measures (BCMs) on the
energy use patterns of 800 units of multi-family low-income residential
properties. Since the effects of ECMs are known and calculable, the main
goal of the study is to determine the degree of change that can be achieved
through education of the occupants and combined effects of ECMs and BCMs.
Anna has also developed a Matlab program which performs complex linear
regression on utility data to assess the degree of efficiency of the
building in question. The energy modeling component involves a sensitivity
study on occupant behavior by adjusting schedules and setpoints as well
as comparison to the Matlab program. The results are still preliminary.

* *

*Ben Brannon*

Ben Brannon will be presenting the initial development of his thesis on the
Modeling and Control Design and Field Experimentation of a Thermally
Activated Residence.  The project stems from a home in Missouri that
attempts to direct heat obtained from massy walls to beneficial locations
around the home and control radiative heat transfer.



*Lincoln Harmer*

This project serves as a proof-of-concept that calibrated building models
when applied real-time information provide enhanced energy management and
diagnostic capabilities. Rather than comparing against a static baseline as
is customary in Monitoring Based Comissioning (MBCx), the building models
used in this project are dynamically kept in tune with the actual building,
over time horizons stretching several time scales. A straightforward energy
management application involves determining the percent deviation in
facility natural gas consumption or electricity use between the actual
building and its model over the last day, week, month, and year; a
predefined threshold of permissible deviation (say +/- 10 ) would then
trigger an alarm or alert to the building management staff. Selecting the
right performance metrics will be part of this research. Envisioned
examples of extended diagnostic capabilities include a) fault detection and
diagnosis (FDD) such as finding the most likely HVAC system parameters that
explain the observed consumption patterns and thus detecting system
degradation, b) prediction of facility energy use and electrical demand for
the next day or week, and c) load aggregation for multiple buildings to be
served by an electrical supplier in a deregulated utility context. The
simulation models employed may be white box models based on first
principles, statistical black box models using only monitored data, or
inverse gray box models that combine reduced order building physics with
simplified models for the energy systems. These inverse gray box models
involving both first principles as well as parameter estimation appear as
likely contenders.  The expected result is a software demonstration of
using a building model and measured historical and/or real-time building
information for building performance evaluation. While many of the research
questions may be answered using surrogate data, we?re collecting real-time
data from two facilities and are aiming to prove the concept on both
buildings using a real-time field implementation.



*Ryan Tanner*

My research is entitled *Stochastic Optimal Control of Mixed Mode Buildings
Considering Occupant Driven Uncertainty*.

I use offline model predictive control to optimize the controls of
(simulated) mixed mode buildings, a process which results in 'optimal
control datasets'. Next, I use machine-learning algorithms to derive viable
BAS control rules from the optimal control datasets. EnergyPlus has been
the building energy modeling tool used throughout my research, providing
virtual test-buildings to try different controls in. Throughout all
simulations, occupant behavior is accounted for by one of two methods. (1)
Co-simulation using the building controls virtual test bed (BCVTB) to
couple the EnergyPlus simulation with occupant behavior algorithms written
in matlab. (2) Writing occupant behavior algorithms directly into
EnergyPlus via the Energy Management System (EMS).

This will be an exciting group of presentations, so make sure you join us
to support our future modelers!!!

We will be meeting at *The Tavern Downtown (1949 Market Street, Denver, CO
80202) at 6:00 pm Tuesday, March 19 *for* *the five short presentations and
drinks.

Please RSVP to Jessie Jones at jjones at rmhgroup.com or (303)312-4641 so that
we can make sure our reservation is large enough. This is not invite only-
so pass the word on to coworkers, colleagues, and other industry
professionals who may be interested.

Thank you,
*RMESE Steering Committee

Hi Jacob,

Just my 2 cents;

Disclaimer; I have only had contact with Modelica (some training,
conference, browsing), and much more TRNSYS experience.

If you were a consultant - looking to simulate new and existing buildings
and recommend energy retrofits for example, I would recommend TRNSYS over
Modelica. But because you need to create component models (no escaping
programming sorry), and because you are a researcher, you can definately
consider Modelica.

You're right, it's possible to do this in either TRNSYS or Modelica. The
learning curve for both would be comparable, in their own quirky ways.
Creating new components is also similar effort for both depending on the
component. You will definitely have to learn some programming concepts in
either case. I think however Modelica components have at least the
*potential* to be cleaner and more elegant than TRNSYS code.

TRNSYS has more component models, but you should really define exactly what
models you really need and compare both tools! Also check external
component libraries - TESS, Modelon...

Creating a complex building shape with windows, zones, etc. is probably
much easier in TRNSYS and it's 3D interface, so if you have complex
geometry, +1 point for TRNSYS.

Also important is training and local experts to ask about strange errors, I
should think you are well situated to get support for Modelica!

And then you must also consider the longevity and impact of your research -
Modelica is... fresher?

Cheers,

Marcus

Hello All,
I have many projects located in downtown Los Angeles. I am looking for some experience from the community on which TMY weather files that people use.
As for DOE file availability, there are LAX, Burbank, Hawthorn, Pasadena...and a few others in the area.
There is no TMY file officially available for downtown Los Angeles. Both ASHRAE and the California Energy Commission have design day weather statistics, but no 8760 weather data.
Short of using 8760 data that we have created from weather stations and other sources; what have all of you don?
Sorry in advance for cross posting.
Thanks,

Andrew,

Downtown Los Angeles is one of the 86 locations for which I have created a CZ2010 weather 
file for the California Energy Commission.  I am in the process of creating a Web page to 
allow download of these weather files, as well as other "typical year" and historical year 
weather files (Those created for or by government entities are free, those created 
commercially or for non-governmental entities are sold), which should be up sometime this 
week.  In the meanwhile,   you can access this file temporarily with this link

http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/downloads/CZ2010_10_1027/LOS-ANGELES-DOWNTOWN_722874_CZ2010.zip

When the Web site is finally up and running, there will be more information about the 
provenance behind all these weather files.

I second Marcus' comments and like to add the following:

The page
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/userGuide/gettingStarted.htmlhas
some pointers for how to get started with Modelica.
The tutorials on
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/latest/help/Buildings_Examples_Tutorial.htmlshow
you what is involved in composing a model using existing component
models. Depending on your application, you may still need to develop some
own component models (typically by modifying existing models). In my view,
since you are a researcher, this is time well spent; Modelica is a language
whose user base is fast growing and the principle of equation-based
modeling is adopted by many system simulation programs.

For modeling building envelops, Modelica has currently limitations for
buildings with many rooms in terms of run-time. You therefore may want to
consider modeling the building envelop in E+, and linking it to Modelica
through the External Interface of E+, either through Functional Mockup
Units or through the Building Controls Virtual Test Bed.

All the best,

Michael

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling simplification for structural concrete columns
Message-ID: <CAPAgWcx-hbZFJ3iy7tLqy3fpoOaxPg8Ki6V-EPqGi1q8uMp=1g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I'm wondering how best to simplify a model when considering structural
concrete columns.
My modelling is in the context of the LEED whole building energy modelling.
So I'm concerned with accuracy as much as acceptability by the LEED
reviewers. I've read the ASHRAE 90.1 user's manual but didn't find a
satisfactory answer.

Here's an example:

        ----
wall   |    | wall
-------|    |------
       |    |
        ----
   concrete column

I can see 3 options for simplifying, each with its own issues:

1. Make the external surface of the column at the same level of the
surrounding walls and model the column surface as having its true thickness
. The issue is that it alters the area of the space inside and doesn't
account for the shading effect of the column.

2. Follow the internal boundary of the column, which introduces 3 surfaces.
Not sure what construction thickness to assign to these surfaces. This
preserves the internal space area but alters the shading effect of the
column.

3. Follow the external boundary of the column. This also introduces 3
surfaces. Not sure what construction thickness to assign to these surfaces
either. It preserves the shading effect of the column but alters the area
of the internal space.

I'm leaning towards option 1. What do you think? Are they other better
options I overlooked?

Of course, things get a bit more complicated when the walls either side are
not aligned or in the same plan...

Thanks!
Patrick

Group,
Please do correct me if I am wrong--->>

   - ASHRAE 90.1 does not require thermal bridging to be modeled in the
   baseline.
   - ASHRAE 90.1 does not require internal mass to be modeled in the
   baseline.
   - ASHRAE 90.1 does not require self shading to be modeled in the
   baseline.
   - ASHRAE 90.1 requires a light weight wall assembly for the baseline.

So the conclusion is that this does not need to be modeled in the baseline
and the question becomes how to model this in the proposed building, or
actually "what gets the project more LEED credits" If I where to do it I
would: (in E+)

   - Ignore the shading element of the concrete pillars and consider the
   walls that separate the zones the only thing that matters for shading.
   - Dependant on the other wall construction-- if mass than add the
   thickness to the total wall area-- if steal framed, wood&other or metal
   than bridge wall with column and add internal mass to account for thermal
   mass.

My conclusion is your #1 should be fine, especially if your not attempting
to get credit for the exposed thermal mass..

To the original post, I would use the line of the wall and ignore the columns. If you feel that there is a considerable shading effect, then use side fins or a building shade. Look at a section of wall the width of one column spacing as calculated the combined U value and thermal mass of the wall to see if the columns will have enough of an effect to make it worth modeling. I don't know how large the columns you are referring to are but it is likely that they would have a negligible effect on the model as a whole, especially when you consider the uncertainty of other values that are input. There is a line in Table G3.1.5 saying that other envelope assemblies that cover less than 5% of the total area need not be explicitly model and can be averaged into other wall assemblies.

As to Jeremiah's post,


  *   ASHRAE 90.1 does not require thermal bridging to be modeled in the baseline.
Thermal bridging should also be taken into account when calculating wall and floor U Values. External un-insulated assemblies must be explicitly modeled.

  *   ASHRAE 90.1 does not require internal mass to be modeled in the baseline.
I don't think any internal constructions are addressed in 90.1. Generally the effect of any internal walls will be negligible compared to the external walls unless your typical wall is heavy weight like a concrete block wall. Some schools are like this. Either way I would say internal mass would not need to be included in the baseline since the baseline is a metal framed building, which implies GWB internal walls.

  *   ASHRAE 90.1 does not require self shading to be modeled in the baseline.
  *   ASHRAE 90.1 requires a light weight wall assembly for the baseline.
The baseline should used a metal framed wall, which still has some mass effects that are required to be modeled. The way I understand it, a "light weight" wall refers to neglecting the mass effects of walls in your calculations.

  *   ASHRAE 90.1 does not require thermal bridging to be modeled in the baseline.
  *   ASHRAE 90.1 does not require internal mass to be modeled in the baseline.

So the conclusion is that this does not need to be modeled in the baseline and the question becomes how to model this in the proposed building, or actually "what gets the project more LEED credits" If I where to do it I would: (in E+)

  *   Ignore the shading element of the concrete pillars and consider the walls that separate the zones the only thing that matters for shading.
  *   Dependant on the other wall construction-- if mass than add the thickness to the total wall area-- if steal framed, wood&other or metal than bridge wall with column and add internal mass to account for thermal mass.
My conclusion is your #1 should be fine, especially if your not attempting to get credit for the exposed thermal mass..

Hi everyone,

I'm wondering how best to simplify a model when considering structural concrete columns.
My modelling is in the context of the LEED whole building energy modelling. So I'm concerned with accuracy as much as acceptability by the LEED reviewers. I've read the ASHRAE 90.1 user's manual but didn't find a satisfactory answer.
Here's an example:

        ----
wall   |    | wall
-------|    |------
       |    |
        ----
   concrete column

I can see 3 options for simplifying, each with its own issues:

1. Make the external surface of the column at the same level of the surrounding walls and model the column surface as having its true thickness . The issue is that it alters the area of the space inside and doesn't account for the shading effect of the column.

2. Follow the internal boundary of the column, which introduces 3 surfaces. Not sure what construction thickness to assign to these surfaces. This preserves the internal space area but alters the shading effect of the column.

3. Follow the external boundary of the column. This also introduces 3 surfaces. Not sure what construction thickness to assign to these surfaces either. It preserves the shading effect of the column but alters the area of the internal space.

I'm leaning towards option 1. What do you think? Are they other better options I overlooked?

Of course, things get a bit more complicated when the walls either side are not aligned or in the same plan...

Thanks!
Patrick

Hi Patrick,

Another choice is to use a tool like Therm to calculate the u-value of a typical section of your wall assembly and then create a uniform wall with that average u-value.  This is an acceptable strategy for a whole building energy model for LEED.  You can make it more complicated but it probably won't change the outcome unless you're also carefully calibrating the interior surface massing, furniture massing, interior surface reflectance and emittance values and using custom glazing performance data.

Most modeling software also has the ability to enter a window setback that will allow you to account for the shading of the column projections, or you can just add fins to the windows to pick up this shading effect.

Using the ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix A assembly u-value tables is the easiest way to factor in thermal bridging effects when creating external wall constructions because they are already factored in.   If you're in CA, the same Title 24 tables have very different results so just be aware their isn't agreement on the magnitude of those effects.

Generally the effect of any internal walls will be negligible compared to the external walls unless your typical wall is heavy weight like a concrete block wall. Some schools are like this. Either way I would say internal mass would not need to be included in the baseline since the baseline is a metal framed building, which implies GWB internal walls.

Internal surface properties including massing and furniture massing can have a big impact on how a model performs.   Some modeling software does a good job of defaulting these inputs but other tools don't do such a good job.  The result of not accounting for these effects is that a very high fraction of solar and thermal load inputs are assumed to directly impact the space air temperature each time step rather than being absorbed and retransmitted in a future time step.  This becomes most obvious if you build a simple single zone model and turn off the HVAC system after a certain period of time and look at the space temperature response over a multi day period.  Without calibration of interior massing you can get very large (>50 degree) diurnal space temperature swings that would never be possible outside of "Model World". 

From an ASHRAE 90.1 modeling perspective unless a specific baseline condition is specified the baseline inputs should be the same as in the proposed design.  The proper way to deal with internal mass is to model it the same in both models.  If treating it as an efficiency measure it should be run as an exception calc since no explicit baseline condition is specified.

I disagree with your understanding of light weight.  You should always take into account mass effects of walls in a model. Light weight just means thermal transmission of loads happens over a shorter time period (1-3 hrs) compared to heavier weight constructions that pass a given thermal load over a longer time period (6-8 hrs).  Some modeling software will show you a plot of how the different construction assemblies you create will transmit thermal loads on an hourly basis which is useful for communicating these differences.

per the 179d guidelines use the 2001 fan power allowance.  remember your 
actual tax building model (i.e. proposed in the leed world) is supposed 
to reflect actually site measured power consumed by the units.  i.e. 
volts x amps x pf (pf = power factor).  (or volts x amps x pf x sqrt(3) 
for 3 phase equipment).  the reality is that the fan will be using less 
power than the nameplate or catalog (good for your simulation savings) 
but the kicker is trying to find the pf values for motors.

FYI.

ASHRAE RP1468, just finished, which provides BIM-to-thermal modeling examples, contains example modeling DOE2 input files and BIM files for concrete thermal bridging, and  other examples like curved windows, etc.

The final report can be I obtained from Mike Vaughn at ASHRAE.

Hi everyone,

I'm wondering how best to simplify a model when considering structural concrete columns.
My modelling is in the context of the LEED whole building energy modelling. So I'm concerned with accuracy as much as acceptability by the LEED reviewers. I've read the ASHRAE 90.1 user's manual but didn't find a satisfactory answer.

Here's an example:

        ----
wall   |    | wall
-------|    |------
       |    |
        ----
   concrete column

I can see 3 options for simplifying, each with its own issues:

1. Make the external surface of the column at the same level of the surrounding walls and model the column surface as having its true thickness . The issue is that it alters the area of the space inside and doesn't account for the shading effect of the column.

2. Follow the internal boundary of the column, which introduces 3 surfaces. Not sure what construction thickness to assign to these surfaces. This preserves the internal space area but alters the shading effect of the column.

3. Follow the external boundary of the column. This also introduces 3 surfaces. Not sure what construction thickness to assign to these surfaces either. It preserves the shading effect of the column but alters the area of the internal space.

I'm leaning towards option 1. What do you think? Are they other better options I overlooked?

Of course, things get a bit more complicated when the walls either side are not aligned or in the same plan...

Thanks!
Patrick

Patrick,

I wouldn't worry about the construction thickness, this has little bearing on the overall energy consumption. Any energy model is an estimation of the actual geometry and if it's out by 1% on floor area it's not going to be significant overall. Ensure any shading effects on windows are picked up (Some software allows you to do this with a shading device object, others might need it specified in the window setup) and that the overall area weighted U-value for your wall, including the concrete column areas is correct. Ensure your baseline is modelled in a consistent way and the LEED reviewers won't have anything to question. It's when you try to gain unfair advantage that they will have an issue.

Hope that helps.

Patrick,

I frankly think that you're looking at the modeling of building geometry 
in simulation programs too literally.  Please keep in mind that in the 
end all
the simulation programs are just doing hundreds of one-dimensional heat 
flow calculations through thousands of time steps.  Wall thickness is needed
only to compute the heat flow characteristics (U-value, response factor, 
transfer function, etc.) but is not modeled explicitly in the 
simulation, i.e.,
walls have no thickness in the simulations.  Similarly, the space volume 
is used only to determine the amount of air participating in the space 
heat balance, so therefore you should always input the actual enclosed 
volume, even if it does jive with the dimensions of the enclosing 
surfaces.  If you're concerned about the shading effect of the columns, 
they can be model them as narrow vertical building shades with widths 
equal to the protruding part of the columns, but if the walls are 
opaque, the effect must be extremely small.

However, I think you're ignoring  what I think is the most significant 
heat transfer aspect of these columns, which is the two-dimensional 
conduction through them, because the columns act like stubby fins on the 
wall, particularly if they're solid concrete with no insulation.  That's 
where I would concentrate my energies if I wanted to get the modeling right.

To do that, you would really have to model the wall-column-wall assembly 
with a 2-D conduction program like THERM (available from LBNL), although 
that was written for modeling window frames and can only output a 
steady-state U-value.  I still have a 2-D conduction program written in 
Fortran called WALFERFN (sounds German, doesn't it ? but the acronym 
stands for WAll Finite Element Response Factor New :-) ) that I use to 
calculate response factors for composite walls, but that can only handle 
planar surfaces.

Message-ID: <1AEDEECB91FA7646B3E635ED4CE8A83B134C47EC@HLMAILSERVER2.hoarelea.local>

I need to carry out a Pedestrian wind comfort (Lawson) Assessment using
ANSYS CFX, I'm reading 'Wind Effects on Buildings' and the Franke et al
paper etc. but it's still not entirely clear to me. If you have any
guidance that would be great, particularly:

 

*         How many wind directions are required? Lawson and the BRE
DG520 suggest 12 but I have heard of 8 directions being used. There's a
big difference in processor/ post-processing time between the two.

 

*         How are the results from the CFD usually post-processed to
produce the acceptability criteria throughout the domain? Is it a case
of writing some kind of script for the postprocessor using weighting
functions based on the local wind data? Are there any examples or
guidance on this? 

 

*         Any guidance on suitable turbulence models for CFX?

 

*         Finally what wind speed is used for the actual modelling, I
assume the 10 year average speed then post processing takes account of
variation in local wind speed, peak gust etc?

Dear all,

We have still spare capacities to accommodate more users on the jEPlus Simulation Server (JESS). Should you be using jEPlus, DesignBuilder, EP-Launch, GenOpt, or your own code running EnergyPlus simulations, it will be reasonably straightforward to hook up with the servers at De Montfort University and execute your jobs remotely. This will potentially give you a bit more computing power than that of your PC or laptop.

Setting up the link is fairly easy (I think!) All you need to do is downloading a small software package (the JESS Client) and letting us know that you want an account on JESS. This trial is completely free and no-obligation to you. The only hurdles are agreeing to those legal stuff ;-)

Here are the steps:

1.       Check out how it works: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jeplus/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:jess_service

2.       Log on to the jEPlus website and download the JESS Client (with EP-Launch Support) package. If you are not yet a user, please register here: http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jeplus/wiki/doku.php?id=start&do=register (only your name and email is required)

Joe, Edwin,

I take your point that I'm probably too literal in my attempt at modelling
the geometry of this wall.

Thanks for the collegial suggestion about THERM. It seems really good and
I'm pretty sure it's going to be useful to me further down the line.

The building I'm modelling is a tower with a square floor section of
1400m2. There are only a few uninsulated columns but they are relatively
big (1.2m wide, 2m deep) and spaced by 8m or 18m. It doesn't seem
appropriate to me to give an overall U-value to the assembly, spreading the
effect of the columns over such "long distances". I'd rather model the
columns as surfaces separate from the  surrounding walls, especially as
they are glazed curtain walls.

Patrick

Joe & Mike's advice to use THERM is something I would support to convert a two dimensional heat transfer problem into one dimensional properties which most energy simulations are based on.  We have good success with this method when looking at edge beams and band beams that in the past have not been continuously insulated and where the extended surface area is significantly different from the projected surface area.

I assume your column has insulation somewhere?  While in annual energy terms the effect of insulating would be call if not a negative effect due to reduced free cooling, the effects in winter could be quite problematic.  The column surface temperatures will be very cool in winter after a weekend and I doubt anyone could sit near them comfortably unless insulated or compensated in some way (temperature, radiant heating etc).

I have had a few projects over the year where band or edge beams between carparks and office spaces have not been continuously insulated.  We have taken IR gun surface temperature measurements, modelled in THERM, taken THERM results to develop IES inputs and simulated remedial measures successfully and quite accurately relative to what the simulation would suggest.

Not knowing your climate zone, you can run different scenarios (boundary conditions and materials) in THERM to get a feel as to whether you have a radiant temperature asymmetry issue in winter.

So comfort not energy will (or should) govern the need to insulate...

Regards,
Graham

Patrick,

Those are some mighty columns!

I think it depends on what you're trying to achieve with the model. If you're looking at radiant temperatures, local thermal comfort or similar, then I would agree that taking an area weighted approach is going to neglect important local differences due to thermal inertia and other factors. However, if you're looking at the energy use of the entire building, and it's conditioned 24 hours, or in a climate with negligible diurnal swing, or with limited thermal mass generally, I would still say that a simplified approach would give you results that are accurate enough. I concur with Joe on the point about thermal bridging. Particularly if the remainder if the fa?ade is insulated. Most construction inputs in energy modelling software don't accurately account for thermal bridging, so if you think they're going to be significant, then use a separate 2D calculation software and adjust your u-values appropriately.

That said, as they're relatively large and it's easy enough to divide up the walls into separate constructions, as it is with software like IES, then by all means model them separately and apply a different construction.

Much of the importance of the above is also dependant on the climate your build is in. E.g. Un-insulated concrete columns in a northern European climate are a terrible idea and will come with a big energy penalty. In warmer climates, their contribution to the overall energy of the building will be much smaller and your efforts on the accuracy of their modelling may be better spent looking at something like the fresh air or building leakage.

Ed

Edwin, Graham,

Thanks for your advice. I had initially misunderstood what Joe was actually
proposing to do to take two dimensional conduction into account in and in
the vicinity of the columns. I'll follow his and your suggestion. It will
be a good learning experience for me anyway.

To answer your questions about the climate zone, this building is in South
Vietnam, so hot and humid all year around with some small variations. The
columns won't be insulated and the building will be air-conditioned. A nice
thermal bridge but not as bad as in a cold climate. Sadly, this is not the
type of project where the energy modelling is informing the design much...

Regards,
Patrick

Hi guys

Thermal bridges and interstitial condensation can be just as much an issue
in hot humid climates as they are in cold. If there's am air leakage path
past the pillars then humid exterior air might infiltrate layers.

A bit off topic, sorry.

Cheers

The thermal mass should also provide a decent benefit-- the reason I did
not mention THERM is that it will provide a bridged conductivity- yet will
not show the benefit of the mass. It would be nice if THERM could also
model the thermal storage potential of the mass. Potentially the thermal
storage energy benefits of the mass would be close to the energy loss of
the added conductivity from the mass...?

Message-ID: <CAOsOtVi0mZdGCFxhORSPR2syW+MXUdr=hS2omOa_mQTr9fn5wg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello eQuesters,

  I am trying to model a two pipe system with a demand operation loop for a
residential building in Maryland.  Currently, my two pipe system turns on
cooling when the zones are calling for cooling as expected, however it
never changes over to heating during the winter.  It is always either off,
or on very rare occasions cooling, resulting in high unmet heating hours.
 Can some one explain how the two pipe system determines when to change
from heating to cooling mode?

I've looked at the zones they are definitely below the heating throttling
range.  Does eQuest take a sum of the room loads on the loop to determine
to heat or to cool?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
Justin

I usually use a snap function to specify when the loop is in heating /
cooling:

 

 

 

By the way, I've modeled a few 2-pipe systems (in the DC area) before,
and it is nearly impossible to get the unmet load hours below 300 for
the average building (without significantly relaxing the thermostat
setpoints, or having supplemental heating/cooling systems).  Hopefully
you are not modeling this for LEED purposes!

I could model it as snap, but I would still get some unmet hours for
certain days.  So far modeling as demand operation seems to be satisfying
the thermostat settings in the summer, but I just can't figure out why
heating isn't turned on.  And the model does have to meet LEED
requirements.

Thermal bridges are rarely the same in hot-humid as they are in the cold. ?The difference in temperature between the design temperature and the thermostat set-temperature is significantly smaller so there is much less conduction. ?So, in a lot of instances it can be disregarded.

Justin,

"Demand" is not adapted to 2-pipe loops. You should use either "Snap" or "Scheduled".

Note that as James pointed out, it is very difficult to figure out the correct changeover period (if it exists!) when using a schedule.

I could model it as snap, but I would still get some unmet hours for certain days.  So far modeling as demand operation seems to be satisfying the thermostat settings in the summer, but I just can't figure out why heating isn't turned on.  And the model does have to meet LEED requirements.

By the way, I've modeled a few 2-pipe systems (in the DC area) before, and it is nearly impossible to get the unmet load hours below 300 for the average building (without significantly relaxing the thermostat setpoints, or having supplemental heating/cooling systems).  Hopefully you are not modeling this for LEED purposes!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] 2 Pipe System Heating/Cooling Change Over

Hello eQuesters,

  I am trying to model a two pipe system with a demand operation loop for a residential building in Maryland.  Currently, my two pipe system turns on cooling when the zones are calling for cooling as expected, however it never changes over to heating during the winter.  It is always either off, or on very rare occasions cooling, resulting in high unmet heating hours.  Can some one explain how the two pipe system determines when to change from heating to cooling mode?

I've looked at the zones they are definitely below the heating throttling range.  Does eQuest take a sum of the room loads on the loop to determine to heat or to cool?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
Justin

Dear all:

If you have played with DIVA for Rhino in the past and would now like to learn how to do some parametric environmental performance wizardry in Grasshopper, have a look at an all day workshop offered by Jonnie Sargent, maker of the VIPER and SHADERADE components in DIVA, on April 12th in Brooklyn, New York . The workshop will be part of a two day Fa?ades Performance symposium at CityTech (http://facade.archpaper.com/ny2013/day-2-technology-workshops/).

Best,

Christoph

Chris,

I totally agree. Thermal bridging is an issue everywhere. My point was that in an energy model, the contribution of a thermal bridge to the overall energy mix of the building in hot climate will be much lower. You have to trust your facade consultant or architect has done his job!

Ed

Hi guys

Thermal bridges and interstitial condensation can be just as much an issue in hot humid climates as they are in cold. If there's am air leakage path past the pillars then humid exterior air might infiltrate layers.

A bit off topic, sorry.

Thanks for your advice. I had initially misunderstood what Joe was actually proposing to do to take two dimensional conduction into account in and in the vicinity of the columns. I'll follow his and your suggestion. It will be a good learning experience for me anyway.

To answer your questions about the climate zone, this building is in South Vietnam, so hot and humid all year around with some small variations. The columns won't be insulated and the building will be air-conditioned. A nice thermal bridge but not as bad as in a cold climate. Sadly, this is not the type of project where the energy modelling is informing the design much...

Patrick,

Those are some mighty columns!

I think it depends on what you?re trying to achieve with the model. If you?re looking at radiant temperatures, local thermal comfort or similar, then I would agree that taking an area weighted approach is going to neglect important local differences due to thermal inertia and other factors. However, if you?re looking at the energy use of the entire building, and it?s conditioned 24 hours, or in a climate with negligible diurnal swing, or with limited thermal mass generally, I would still say that a simplified approach would give you results that are accurate enough. I concur with Joe on the point about thermal bridging. Particularly if the remainder if the fa?ade is insulated. Most construction inputs in energy modelling software don?t accurately account for thermal bridging, so if you think they?re going to be significant, then use a separate 2D calculation software and adjust your u-values appropriately.

That said, as they?re relatively large and it?s easy enough to divide up the walls into separate constructions, as it is with software like IES, then by all means model them separately and apply a different construction.

Much of the importance of the above is also dependant on the climate your build is in. E.g. Un-insulated concrete columns in a northern European climate are a terrible idea and will come with a big energy penalty. In warmer climates, their contribution to the overall energy of the building will be much smaller and your efforts on the accuracy of their modelling may be better spent looking at something like the fresh air or building leakage.

I agree that the columns are unlikely to have a significant impact on the
energy model - even if they're quite big.

We just use THERM to work out an effective insulation thickness to account for bridging as well as extended surface area (greater than projected).  We keep the mass the same in the dynamic simulation so you get the effect of both provided you layer the insulation and other layers correctly around the mass ?
If insulation is non existent then things get trickier but I am guessing adjusting the conductivity of the concrete to get the same effective U-Value on a projected area basis in THERM won't be too far off depending on what is desired from the simulation ...

It has been a few years since I have used DOE-2.2 day to day.

I recall that the hours where loads (temperatures) not met are reported include any optimum start / night purge hours.  So if you have optimum start in your schedules you would typically get a few hundred hours reported even though conditions are being met during what we would call established building hours (i.e. hours when comfort conditions are expected).  As long as night purge / optimum start existed you would never be able to zero these hours.

I am unsure whether this has been tidied up in the most recent versions and I am also unsure whether it is across all SS reports.  If I recall correctly SS-R, SS-F and others were affected in this way.

It's not an either-or situation, i.e., either use THERM or model the column as a 1-D layer 
with thermal mass.  It's both, use THERM to get a better conductivity, and then use that 
conductivity instead of the nominal  concrete conductivity in the 1-D layer.

Hi all,

I am currently doing daylighting simulation for LEED 2009, but  there
is always SquareFootage discrepancy of each room between my daylighting
modeling tool and the Revit model, it just can not be 100% the same with
the design model. But the leed requrire the SF of each room should be same
with the architecure drawings and daylighting report? Could anyone help me
with it, is there any allowance range for the simulation method for LEED
2009, which is not mentioned in the reference guide?

Thanks so much,

Te

Per the attached Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED V2-1, which is available
for free download from LEED On-line, page 30, it states that a 10% variance
for built up areas is allowed.

Hope this helps.

Different area conventions exist. For example, in the UK we have nett
lettable area and gross internal area. The former has partition thickness
subtracted whilst the latter doesn't. This can easily account for 10%
difference. I'm not sure what area convention revit defaults to (or even if
alternative conventions can be selected).

Te Qi,

If you're talking about LEED credit IEQ 8.1, I have noticed that reviewers only care if all of the credits that rely on "regularly occupied space" (ROS) are filled out the same, and that they add up to the building total sf.

It is very difficult to get the architect's numbers and the daylight simulation numbers to be exactly the same, so I usually just use their numbers (as long as they are within about 5% of mine) and report the % of each room that qualifies.

I suggest trying the www.LEEDuser.com forum since this forum is mostly about energy modeling.

Best,
Jill

Dear Claire,

*         How many wind directions are required? Lawson and the BRE
DG520 suggest 12 but I have heard of 8 directions being used. There's a
big difference in processor/ post-processing time between the two.

 

Depends if it goes to public enquiry, I had to revise my 8 directions to
16. Remember wind tunnel guys will probably do at least 16, possibly
more so you are contending with them.

 

*         How are the results from the CFD usually post-processed to
produce the acceptability criteria throughout the domain? Is it a case
of writing some kind of script for the postprocessor using weighting
functions based on the local wind data? Are there any examples or
guidance on this? 

 

Statistical analysis based on ESDU criteria (this is something you need
to purchase) and the book by lawson. You will need to insert notional
monitoring points in all the key locations where you expect issues to
occur and post process based on those points. Typically around 25 to 30
locations minimum. In a wind tunnel they will pick these locations and
insert Irwin probes or similar to monitor the conditions at those
points. 

 

The ESDU criteria also tells you how to set up the upstream wind profile
based on a desktop analysis of what is even further upstream. 

 

*         Any guidance on suitable turbulence models for CFX?

 

At least 2 equation model k-E, the real issue is that you are probably
doing steady state and therefore not accounting for gusts. The wind
tunnel guys will pick on this aspect here.

 

*         Finally what wind speed is used for the actual modelling, I
assume the 10 year average speed then post processing takes account of
variation in local wind speed, peak gust etc?

 

>From memory i think i used 5m/s at 10m height, corrected by ESDU
profile. It really doesn't matter too much as the results you get for
5m/s need to be correlated to your weather file (8760 entries) for the
nearest location. Also, there are several Lawson criteria that are in
play, and i think one set was called CDDC or DDC or something similar
which related to projects in canary wharf area only. Don't use this
criteria. I would do a google search on wind studies for various
council's / local gov agencies and see what criteria they used. 

 

The wind tunnel players in UK are BRE, RWDI and BMT. If you find their
submissions online you will see what they have used. PS - they are not
in agreement with each other!!

 

Best of luck...

 

Tariq.

produce the acceptability criteria throughout the domain? Is it a case
of writing some kind of script for the postprocessor using weighting
functions based on the local wind data? Are there any examples or
guidance on this? 

 

*         Any guidance on suitable turbulence models for CFX?

 

*         Finally what wind speed is used for the actual modelling, I
assume the 10 year average speed then post processing takes account of
variation in local wind speed, peak gust etc?

 

Thanks,

Hi all,

Is there any CBECS-like database for countries other than the US and UK?
I'm particularly interested in Australia. I vaguely remember there is a
database for Canada but don't remember its name.

Thanks in advance.

	Cooling Plant
Message-ID: <CAMdiMCKhPDE1XdS_bRxtbZrit89dpxFRRr6aph9Qe+0sZfavYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I am trying to get an idea of how to model a new mixed use building (Office
+ retail) with a existing district cooling plant  serving other office
buildings on the site for LEED purposes.
Since it is a district cooling system, the plant  load, efficiency ,
performance and operation is dependent on the other existing buildings on
the site as well. I am not sure how to separate the energy metrics in the
model  for the plant associated with the  new proposed building.

1.Does the baseline building model also has to take into consideration the
existing plant in simulation or the baseline will be just modeled is it
will be for a new building with the plant type being decided by the
conditioned square footage of the new proposed building?
2. When modeling the proposed building, do i neglect the effects of other
building on the district cooling plant performance and use the part load
efficiency curves and load shedding schedules for the plant equipments (
towers, pumps, Chillers) as if they were serving only the new proposed
building? has anyone done a model like this and how does the LEED
guidelines approach this issue?

The simulation community help is much appreciated.
Please respond if you have any questions as well.

There is a guide that ASHRAE/LEED uses to model the district cooling
plants.  There is two methods to utilize, and each have their benefits and
constraints.  It is mentioned where to find it in the LEED manual and in
the most recent EAp2 Table 1.4 downloads.

Hope this helps,

nabers.gov.au but not all ratings are disclosed on the website and it is a voluntary system so not all the market.
For commercial office buildings only current Building Energy Efficiency Certificates can be views under Commercial Building Disclosure, http://www.cbd.gov.au/FindBEEC.aspx.  If an owner / lessor is selling a building or leasing space they must disclose its performance to prospective buyers / tenants.  So it should show all assets that are seeking buyers, tenants, but wouldn't show assets that are fully leased or not up for sale.  There are also some exemptions and I think the size threshold is 2,500 m2 and above.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Optimizing a DOAS
Message-ID: <3E0EBBB7260AE24CB0962ECC6B83903401C1EBAC@THEWHO.michaelsengineering.local>

All,

I?m working on a retrocomissioning project trying to optimize a DOAS system as best as I can. This particular system has (in this order) an enthalpy wheel, preheating steam coil, cooling coil, sensible wheel, and heating coil. Downstream there are 4-pipe fan coil units. Hot water is provided by a steam to hot water converter and a chiller with a closed circuit tower that can be switched over to free cooling when ambient conditions allow.

I?ve made myself an excel model, which has worked to some extent, but when I want to ask some of the more challenging questions it?s going to require a not-so-modest commitment to developing it (and circular references are driving me nuts). I?m fairly confident I can?t do what I want to do with DOE2 (with which I?m most familiar). Is E+ capable of modeling to this level of detail? Some of the types of questions I?d like answers to:


?         When it?s extremely hot outside and the enthalpy wheel and cooling coil are running to dehumidify, is it more efficient to run the sensible wheel (near) full speed (thus lowering the exhaust temperature, allowing some additional cooling from the enthalpy wheel, and lowering the cooling coil load) or to do more modest reheating to balance the downstream cooling and heating demands? My gut says it?s going to be best to run the sensible wheel only as fast as is necessary to keep all the downstream heating coils closed, but I?d like some numbers.

?         When temperatures are mild, but not sufficient for full water-side free cooling, what?s the right balance between the enthalpy wheel and terminal cooling and heating? Is the chiller operating at a part load that?s more cost effective than the heating, and how does the enthalpy wheel strike the right balance? Is there a sequence that is optimum, or would it be something that needs to be continually optimized by the controls system?

Obviously I?d need to go up the E+ learning curve, but I think that?s something I?ll need to do eventually (unless the fabled DOE2.3 engine comes out and can do this type of thing), so if it?s between that and continuing to develop a complicated excel model, it may be worth it for me. I just don?t want to go down that path only to find out I can?t get some of the answers I?m looking for?

Any thoughts (or references) are appreciated.

Cheers,

Amit,

There's a fairly comprehensive document, "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2 and LEED 2009 - Design & Construction," which explains the options available to you, of which there are three:


*         Measurement of existing plant to determine efficiencies

*         Simulation of existing plant with existing building to determine efficiencies

*         If data is unavailable for the above 2 options, then defaults are allowed.

You model your baseline building as a normal standalone building, with the relevant chiller plant for the climate zone etc. Let me know if you can't find a copy of the guide and I'll send one over.

Regards,
Ed

Eric,
I have been looking at similar situations in our warm and humid climate for
about three years trying to optimize both DX and water cooled heat pump
DOAS with various combinations of heat recovery (sensible and total) and
have not found anything that can do a very good job of analyzing these
units under all oa conditions and varying return/exhaust air conditions.
I've played around with a spreadsheet solution as well using TMY3 weather
data for all 8760 hours and columns for heat transfer/temperature/humidity
across each device node in the process at each oa condition with fixed
return/exhaust conditions.
I will be very interested to hear/see if we get many responses to this.
These units are a big portion of the energy consumption in k-12 schools and
institutional occupancies in the warm and humid southeast. Thanks for
kicking this discussion off.

Dear Eric,
I know enough to be dangerous with EnergyPlus and can say this much:

*         Your questions are good ones about DOAS operation.  They can be very complex and all of the details you mention have an impact.

*         Don't forget the impact of all that pressure drop for various coil and heat exchanger components.  I modeled something in E+ with similar complexity (indirect evap cooling with economizer, heating and DX coil) not long ago and found that using a constant speed fan for variable airflow loads negated most of the savings for some climates.  VSD fans proved to make a big difference.

*         Energy Plus can probably model anything you wish, especially when you include its EMS capability.  That does not mean it's easy!  DesignBuilder and Simergy are making the learning curve become easier, but it is still no small task.

*         Finally, I know that Semco has a bin-based spreadsheet which is used for modeling performance of their equipment with both single and double energy recovery wheels and almost any heating / cooling configuration you might like.  Consider checking in with your local rep.  I have used that in the past and it's pretty thorough for constant airflow applications.

With Excel you can enable circular references to enable the calculations to converge.  If you have 8760 rows then you can also run a simple macro to reseed a column with a calculated result so you in effect get convergence.

One challenge with these types of systems is what is optimal under one set of ambient and internal conditions may not be as optimal in another set of conditions.  So coming up with one set of controls will not optimise for all conditions.  None of the software that I have used over the years would allow you to properly have different controls for different ambient conditions.  So testing one set of controls and looking at annual results you would lose what is really happening under different conditions unless you look at hourly results but then your ability to adjust controls for different conditions is limited unless you go to something more open and flexible.

At the end of the day being able to model different controls would be useful to understand what the sensitivity and thus opportunity or risk is.  If the differences are small then there is a strong argument to keep it simple and find that balance of simplicity and efficiency so that long term efficiency can be sustained rather than having something no one knows how to fix or operate ...

Graham

Part of the attraction of the DOAS system with the fan-coil units is to reduce the amount of reheat needed in the building. You would have to be very efficient to provide simultaneous heating and cooling in a way that uses less energy than eliminating the simultaneous heating and cooling.

Generally you will be better off when you can reduce a load, rather than trying to provide that load through use of extra equipment. Understanding that the ability to program the sequence may not be infinite either, I think you are correct with your first thought to use the energy recovery equipment at little as possible while eliminating the need for reheat.

I?m not sure if I understand your second item about the chiller, but I think the same thought applies. Do you mean that the energy recovery system would false load the chiller to make it operate more efficiently, but at a higher load? The change in efficiency would have to be pretty dramatic to offset the additional MMBtu. Maybe there is some combination where it works out.

The other thought I had was if the control system has enough flexibility in the sequence of operations to account for some of the less frequent conditions. Particularly if the building operators are hands-on, it could be better to have a generically efficient scheme which might miss on a few infrequent conditions but over the course of the year provides a reliable energy savings.

Have you looked at TRNSYS as an option to simulate the components? Many of the flexibilities of EnergyPlus, but without the need to model the whole building. Unless you were going to model the building anyway.

All,

I?m working on a retrocomissioning project trying to optimize a DOAS system as best as I can. This particular system has (in this order) an enthalpy wheel, preheating steam coil, cooling coil, sensible wheel, and heating coil. Downstream there are 4-pipe fan coil units. Hot water is provided by a steam to hot water converter and a chiller with a closed circuit tower that can be switched over to free cooling when ambient conditions allow.

I?ve made myself an excel model, which has worked to some extent, but when I want to ask some of the more challenging questions it?s going to require a not-so-modest commitment to developing it (and circular references are driving me nuts). I?m fairly confident I can?t do what I want to do with DOE2 (with which I?m most familiar). Is E+ capable of modeling to this level of detail? Some of the types of questions I?d like answers to:


?         When it?s extremely hot outside and the enthalpy wheel and cooling coil are running to dehumidify, is it more efficient to run the sensible wheel (near) full speed (thus lowering the exhaust temperature, allowing some additional cooling from the enthalpy wheel, and lowering the cooling coil load) or to do more modest reheating to balance the downstream cooling and heating demands? My gut says it?s going to be best to run the sensible wheel only as fast as is necessary to keep all the downstream heating coils closed, but I?d like some numbers.

?         When temperatures are mild, but not sufficient for full water-side free cooling, what?s the right balance between the enthalpy wheel and terminal cooling and heating? Is the chiller operating at a part load that?s more cost effective than the heating, and how does the enthalpy wheel strike the right balance? Is there a sequence that is optimum, or would it be something that needs to be continually optimized by the controls system?

Obviously I?d need to go up the E+ learning curve, but I think that?s something I?ll need to do eventually (unless the fabled DOE2.3 engine comes out and can do this type of thing), so if it?s between that and continuing to develop a complicated excel model, it may be worth it for me. I just don?t want to go down that path only to find out I can?t get some of the answers I?m looking for?

Any thoughts (or references) are appreciated.

Cheers,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Symposium on Sustainable Urban Design @ MIT
Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E800FE64FE9@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues,

Over the next two decades, the UN expects that we need to accommodate new homes for 1.7 billion city dwellers. There is an undeniable need for concepts and solutions that lead to more sustainable urban growth, concepts that work across a range of climates and cultures. What are those solutions? Are there good examples? How can we evaluate them on a large scale? What role can computer based environmental performance analysis play in this context?

It is my pleasure to invite you to an all-day symposium on Sustainable Urban Design - Case Studies and Design Workflows<http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/projects/SustainableUrbanDesignSymposium> on May 6th 2013 at MIT. The symposium is supported by the MIT Energy Initiative, MIT's new Center for Advanced Urbanism and the German American Chamber of Commerce Inc. During the morning session speakers from practice and academia will present examples and workflows of how to implement measures of sustainability in their projects. During the afternoon session we will be presenting Umi<http://urbanmodellinginterface.ning.com/>, our new urban modeling platform to evaluate operational energy use, daylighting, outdoor comfort and walkability at the neighborhood level. Umi has been extensively used in two graduate level classes at MIT and Harvard and student projects resulting from these classes will be presented in a poster sessions in the late afternoon. During the closing discussion we hope to develop a better understanding of the role computational design tools may play in the transition to more sustainable urban planning practices.

If you decide to attend, please RSVP<http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/projects/SustainableUrbanDesignSymposium/rsvp.html> by April 15th.

Best regards,

Christoph
