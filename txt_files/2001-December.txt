  Anybody aware of the energy simulation of a parliament or a State
Legislature building - preferable that can be found on the web ?
                                          Thanks

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Heating Sizing Calculations
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200112030835.AA350506pd80000097493@gard.com>

  The following problem occurs many times with the climate of the
Mediterranean:
  Building energy simulation codes are used both for sizing equipment and
for energy simulation. In the heating part, given the very large internal
loads of some modern buildings, this results in undersizing the heating
equipment - the heating equipment should be able to heat even if some of
the internal loads are not present.
  I was wondering if any of the codes take this into account explicitely
(ie not through using SIZING_ADJUST factors).

Good day all.
We have been trying to manipulate some weather files but are running into
formatting troubles. Specifically, I am trying to convert a TRY file to the
.WEA format.
Is anyone aware of a universal weather converter for, or even a
viewer/editor with which I could manipulate a .WEA file.
Failing that, does anyone have a TRY file for Kew, London in a .WEA format.
Your help would be greatly appreciated.

Many Thanks

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Supermarket refrigeration modelling questions
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200112041509.AA094692pd80000098014@gard.com>

I am working on a simulation of a supermarket using DOE2.1e and using the
refrigeration model.  I have two questions regarding the effect of humidity
on the refrigeration system.  Firstly, when the fans are off, humidity is
not reported in the SS-N as it uses return air humidity.  What does the
refrigeration model use for space humidity during the periods when the fan
is off?

More fundamentally, how is humidity data reflected in the refrigeration
energy simulation?  Does the defrost energy reduce with reduced humidity?
How is the compressor energy reduced with reduced space humidity?

Many thanks!

If by high tech buildings you are referring to a modern office buildings,
then loads from desktop PC's, monitors, printers, copiers, etc. typically
will be about .5 watts per square foot, but may range from .5 to 1.0 watts
per foot.  Note the actual power use by such equipment is well below the
nameplate power data.

Refer to published ASHRAE papers, starting in 1994, authored by Chris
Wilkins, who reported on extensive monitoring of such loads in real world
office buildings.

Lighting loads, refer to 90.1-1999 for maximum power densities permissible
for office occupancies.  But lighting designers who apply efficient fixtures
for interior lighting design can easily achieve excellent illumination levels
using well below 1.0 watts per foot.

I recall a study by the British Columbia Energy Management Task Force that
monitored the current draw on outlet circuits in a couple of buildings in
the mid-1990's.  As suggested below, it found plug loads to be in the order
of 0.75 to 0.85W/ft? during the day.  The interesting part was the
unoccupied plug loads of around 0.35W/ft?.

Hello, fellow Bldg-Sim listers,

In the early 90s, I took two looks at office plug loads for the British
Columbia Buildings Corporation:
o "Measurement of Heat Output of Typical Office Equipment" (1991)
o "Office Equipment Energy Use in the Richard Blanshard Building, 1992 &
1994" (1995)
(These might be the studies Brian Fountain referred to.  While I was here in
BC, and loosely connected with the BC EMTF, I don't recall any EMTF reports
on the subject.)

The first study measured electricity draw of typical computer equipment, a
facsimile and a medium-sized photocopier, using a BMI Mod. 3060 Power
Profiler, which could capture the effects of switching power supplies.  The
computers covered the SOFTA for the time (8086s, 286s, 386s and 486s -
remember them?) but the measurements may shed some light on todays' Pentiums
and Athlons; I believe the chip consumption was only a small part of the
total.  I suspect a bigger issue today is probably penetration of LCD
screens, rather than CRTs.

For a workplace of 10 people, at 150 sq.ft. / workstation, with a (typical
for the time) mix of 1 computer per station, 2 printers, a fax & a
photocopier, I estimated typical office plug loads at 0.65 W/sq.ft.


The second study used data gathered over several weeks from 3 floors of
BCBCs 244,000 sq.ft. Richard Blanshard Building, a government office in
Victoria where the receptacle circuits were broken out from lighting.  The
devices used were ACM Mod 3710s, which again could capture voltage & current
waveform distortions due to switching power supplies.  The measured floors
had ~425 occupants on 68,387 sq.ft., with 256 PCs and 406 computer monitors
(the difference made up by terminals connected to a mini-comp); with a
typical mix of printers, photocopiers, etc.

For all three measured floors:
- peak simultaneous plug load demand was 0.883 W/sq.ft.
- during occupied hours, the mean plug load demand was 0.792 W/sq.ft.
- unoccupied hours mean plug load demand was 0.360 W/sq.ft.

(Isn't it a pity that what we've gained in lighting has largely been lost to
plug loads?)

These studies indicated that using office equipment nameplate ratings would
overestimate actual electricity demand and heat output by 480 & 590%,
respectively.


However, if you use these measurements, please note that
- the computers measured are not P3s & 4s or Athlons, nor equipped with CDs
or CD-Rs/RWs
- in some "high-tech" installations such as server farms, stockbrokers,
graphics etc., computer density are often much higher than 1 / worker
- LCDs draw much less than the CRTs measured
- If Energy Star equipment features are enabled, unoccupied demands might be
much lower.

Personally, for simulation of typical offices, I still use 0.8 - 0.9
W/sq.ft., and enquire about LCD screen penetration, & numbers of computers /
worker.  For "high-tech" installations like server farms, I'd recommend
measuring the typical equipment to be installed, with 'meters' capable of
capturing switching power supplies' voltage & current waveform distortions -
*not* a standard RMS meter.

If anyone on the list knows of electricity demand & consumption measurements
of current computers and LCD screens, I suspect we'd all appreciate hearing
about them.


Hope this helps,
Ian Theaker, P.Eng.

Hello all,
I am trying to relate fan, pumps and controls energy consumption to an
space/air load for different systems, i.e. fan coils or VAV versus chilled
beams.
Or can the pump load be related to some other factor, i.e. a circuit load
Many thanks

Apologies,
Has anyone looked at these issues, or had any experience calculating these
figures?
There has been very little done on this topic in the UK.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Announcing SANKHYA Varadhi 1.1 - Beta4 Release
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200112210019.AA194979pd80000103173@gard.com>


1) Announcing Availability of SANKHYA Varadhi - Version 1.1, Beta-4 Release.

(Attached: SANKHYA Varadhi - Version 1.1, Beta-4 Release Announcement)

2) Using Varadhi for Building Energy Simulation, Automation and Analysis:

SANKHYA Varadhi (http://www.sankhya.com/info/varadhi.html) is an Object
Middleware Platform that can be used for creating a distributed system 
that Simulates and/or Manages intelligent buildings without the need for 
centralized control.

 a) A building automation usage scenario is provided at the following location:

        http://www.sankhya.com/info/products/varadhi/usage.html

 b) Here is an example that demonstrates the use of CORBA in Building 
    Energy Simulation:

Using Varadhi, different entitites that are part of a Building, which 
have to be simulated/analyzed can be treated as objects. For example,
it should be possible to declare a CORBA IDL interface as shown below 
(An example only - a real interface (or set of interfaces) are better 
designed and standardized by a group of domain experts).

 interface window {

  attribute long external_temparature;
  attribute long internal_temparature;

  // Low Tech: Adjust Ventilator; Hi-Tech: Don't know :-)
  void set_conductivity(in long c);

  attribute long internal_luminance;
  attribute long external_luminance;

  // Low Tech: operate blinds. Hi-Tech: Use a polaraid film
  void set_translucence(in long t);

  ....

 }

Consider an 'Intelligent Window' that can be configured for optimal 
energy control. Now, a simulation system can use a 'Simulated' Window 
Object that implements the above interface. A 'real' system would use 
an actual intelligent window. Either case, the other objects in the 
system need not know if something is being 'simulated' or if it is real !

Basically, this will allow simulation of parts of a system working together 
with other 'real' parts of the system. As well as provide for a standard 
framework for fitting together 'simulation components' that can be designed 
and implemented by different groups and companies ! These can run on different 
computers, be implemented in different languages and SANKHYA Varadhi 
(possibly along with other ORBs) will take care of such language and 
location details in a standards compliant manner.
