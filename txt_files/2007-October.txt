Check the PS-C or PS-D report to see which piece of equipment is
overloaded.  That will help you diagnose what is going on in your
central plant.

Hello,
 
I am trying to ?fix? an eQUEST model a co-worker of mine started. I get
this error message for every zone that was created. Can anyone tell me
what it references or what is causing the error?
 
System: EL1 Sys7 (SZRH) (G.WNW2)         could not successfully
             allocate all energy to the 5-minute bins during
             heating because of an equipment overload.  The peak
             load used in ECONOMICS will not include the fraction
             due to the overload, but the PLANT reports will.
             Mon/Day/Hour:  6 15  1  Energy:   8.9  Unallocated: 0.135
 
Thanks in advance for your help.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710292032.AA3203765pd80003945308@gard.com>

Has anyone received a CIR ruling or received USGBC approval on a project for
parking exhaust control ie CO sensors and VFD?

 

There's been discussion on this topic on BLDG-SIM but my Google search
didn't show confirmation that LEED 2.2 EAc1 credit is available. 

 

Also couldn't find a LEED 2.2. CIR ruling. Is one available?

 

Please share details on approach allowed by USGBC for baseline if available.


 

Is a constant volume parking exhaust system 24/7 for multi-family still
done?  

 

Or is common practice to have some level of exhaust volume and fan control
even if code doesn't require it?  

 

Thanks,

 

Brian Thornton

To respond to your first question, you do have to add extra resistance
to underground floors/walls.  Go to this site
(http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/dirun/23n_d_1.pdf
<http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/dirun/23n_d_1.pdf> ) and read the
article that starts on page 19.  You end up having to add an effective
R-value and a 1 foot layer of soil to your underground constructions.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQuest modeling



Modeling multi family residential in Canada. 

			1. Part of the first floor is below grade.
			a. Does the model need to be adjusted for
weaknesses in the DOE analysis method?
			b. I've reviewed a report dated Oct 2003 that
says that there is an 'anomaly' in the way that DOE2 calculates heat
loss to the ground.  The report says that DOE2 overestimates heat loss
to ground.
			        Is the anomaly still there, or has it
been corrected?  
			      c. The report suggests that the correction
be to increase the resistance of the floors/walls that are in contact
with ground.  Is that right?  By how much?

	2. The energy efficiency (EE) program we're evaluating works to
eliminate thermal bridges, where possible, in the building construction.
(i.e. balconies outside of apartments)

			a. How do I model a building with balconies but
no thermal bridges in the EE case? 
			b. How do I add them in the baseline case? 
			c. Another report models a 'composite' thermal
resistance for walls that accounts for the studs vs. the insulation in
the wall construction to account for the thermal bridges created by the
wall studs. Is that the correct way to do things?

1)      How do I convert blower door test results at 50 Pa to natural
infiltration? 
a.      Rule of thumb seems to be divide by 20 

			b.      LBL method uses a factor N = C x H x S x
L.  C, H, S, L based on climate, building height, leak shape, and wind
shielding.  I cannot know leak shape and I do not know wind shielding.
Is there a way to determine 'standard' values for these factors an still
allow me to use building height and climate to adjust for the N factor?

2)      Most thermostats in Canada are bimetallic.  The program requires
electronic thermostats.  The consensus is that the electronic
thermostats are able to hold the temperature more precisely than the
bimetallic thermostats.

a.      Assumption is that the 'comfort' temp is the lowest temp reached
before the heating system is activated.  If bimetallic is set pt temp +-
2F, and the 'comfort' temp is 70F, then the bimetallic thermostat will
be set at 72F to make sure the temperature is always above comfort temp.
If the electronic thermostat is set pt temp +- 1F, then the electronic
thermostat will be set at 71F.  Another report modeled this by changing
the set point temperature by 1F to account for the presence of the
electronic vs. bimetallic thermostat.

			b.      Is there a way to model this in DOE2
(eQUEST) that recognizes bimetallic vs. electronic thermostats? 

3)      The current simulation only allows me to model the water heater
outside of the heated living space.  However, the water heaters are
located in the apartment and therefore contribute to the thermal
equation.

a.      How do I model the water heater in the apartment? 

			b.      The water heaters are supposed to have
insulated pipes for the first 10 feet.  How do I model that? 

4)      All units are ventilated with outside air.  The EE program
requires them to have heat recovery on their ventilation systems.

a.      Are fan schedules equal to the ventilation schedule if the heat
system is electric baseboard? 

			b.      How do I simulate the heat recovery
efficiency?  I know the efficiency at -25 degrees C only.  Can I model
the entire system off that one point?

5)      How do I model a ventilation system controlled by a humidistat?
It seems to me that it would be based on behavior patterns - when
showers are taken, how long, cooking practices, etc.  Even if I know
those things, how do I translate them into a ventilation schedule - both
cfm and how long the system is run?

Thanks for any input. Jessica

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710261728.AA2845671pd80003942626@gard.com>

Modeling multi family residential in Canada.

			1. Part of the first floor is below grade.
			a. Does the model need to be adjusted for
weaknesses in the DOE analysis method?
			b. I've reviewed a report dated Oct 2003 that
says that there is an 'anomaly' in the way that DOE2 calculates heat
loss to the ground.  The report says that DOE2 overestimates heat loss
to ground.
				Is the anomaly still there, or has it
been corrected?  
			      c. The report suggests that the correction
be to increase the resistance of the floors/walls that are in contact
with ground.  Is that right?  By how much?
	2. The energy efficiency (EE) program we're evaluating works to
eliminate thermal bridges, where possible, in the building construction.
(i.e. balconies outside of apartments)
			a. How do I model a building with balconies but
no thermal bridges in the EE case?
			b. How do I add them in the baseline case?
			c. Another report models a 'composite' thermal
resistance for walls that accounts for the studs vs. the insulation in
the wall construction to account for the thermal bridges created by the
wall studs. Is that the correct way to do things?
1)	How do I convert blower door test results at 50 Pa to natural
infiltration?
a.	Rule of thumb seems to be divide by 20
			b.	LBL method uses a factor N = C x H x S x
L.  C, H, S, L based on climate, building height, leak shape, and wind
shielding.  I cannot know leak shape and I do not know wind shielding.
Is there a way to determine 'standard' values for these factors an still
allow me to use building height and climate to adjust for the N factor?
2)	Most thermostats in Canada are bimetallic.  The program requires
electronic thermostats.  The consensus is that the electronic
thermostats are able to hold the temperature more precisely than the
bimetallic thermostats.
a.	Assumption is that the 'comfort' temp is the lowest temp reached
before the heating system is activated.  If bimetallic is set pt temp +-
2F, and the 'comfort' temp is 70F, then the bimetallic thermostat will
be set at 72F to make sure the temperature is always above comfort temp.
If the electronic thermostat is set pt temp +- 1F, then the electronic
thermostat will be set at 71F.  Another report modeled this by changing
the set point temperature by 1F to account for the presence of the
electronic vs. bimetallic thermostat.
			b.	Is there a way to model this in DOE2
(eQUEST) that recognizes bimetallic vs. electronic thermostats?
3)	The current simulation only allows me to model the water heater
outside of the heated living space.  However, the water heaters are
located in the apartment and therefore contribute to the thermal
equation.
a.	How do I model the water heater in the apartment?
			b.	The water heaters are supposed to have
insulated pipes for the first 10 feet.  How do I model that?
4)	All units are ventilated with outside air.  The EE program
requires them to have heat recovery on their ventilation systems.
a.	Are fan schedules equal to the ventilation schedule if the heat
system is electric baseboard?
			b.	How do I simulate the heat recovery
efficiency?  I know the efficiency at -25 degrees C only.  Can I model
the entire system off that one point?
5)	How do I model a ventilation system controlled by a humidistat?
It seems to me that it would be based on behavior patterns - when
showers are taken, how long, cooking practices, etc.  Even if I know
those things, how do I translate them into a ventilation schedule - both
cfm and how long the system is run?

Thanks for any input. Jessica

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] How to model Snowmelt System in eQUEST?
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710261702.AA0201437pd80003941500@gard.com>

Calculate snow melting energy may not be a easy task. Snow melting is a transient process and the energy consumed by a snow melting systems is affected by many factors, such as the control strategy, layout of the heating elements, and the targeted snow melting performance. If the snow melting system uses stored solar energy or coupled with geothermal heat pump system, it will be even more complicated to calculate the energy consumed for snow melting.
 
ASHRAE handbook of Application has a whole chapter dedicated for snow melting. The snow melting loads provided in the handbook may be good for design but not suffice for energy calculation. Just like the peak cooling loads can not be directly used to calculate cooling energy consumption. The snow flags in weather data is not enough for estimating the running hours of a snow melting system because of the requirement of pre-heating (because of the thermal mass of the concrete pavement) and post-heating (to prevent refreezing of the snowmelt)
 
There has been at least two ASHRAE research projects focusing on developing simulation model for snow melting on heated pavement. 
 
Ramsey, J.W, et al. 1999. Updated Design Guidelines for Snow Melting Systems. ASHRAE 926-RP Final Report.

 

Rees, S.J., et al. 2001. Development of a Two-Dimensional Transient Model of Snow-Melting System, and Use of the Model for Analysis of Design Alternatives. ASHRAE 1090-RP Final Report.

 

There has also several papers published recently on modeling snow melting, experimental validation, and effects of design parameter and control strategies on the performance of snow melting systems.

 

Liu, X., et al. 2007. "Modeling snow melting on heated pavement surfaces. Part I : Model Development",  Applied Thermal Engineering. 27(5-6):1115-1124.

Liu, X. , et al. 2004. A Simulation Tool for the Design of the Hydronic Bridge Snow Melting System. 12th International Road Weather Conference, Bingen (on Rhine), Germany.

 

In addition, there are several very interesting papers discussing innovative snow melting systems, some of them using renewable energy.

Waler J Eugster, Jurg Schatzmann. Harnessing Solar Energy for Winter Road Clearing on Heavily Loaded Expressways[C]. Proceeding of Xith PIARC International Winter Road congress, Sapporo, Japan, January,2002.

It seems that snow melting systems start gaining more attentions from the public... It is really not far way to integrating a snow melting model into eQUEST/DOE-2.2 or E+ but not sure the availability of any funding for this work.

Ryan,
 
Yes, I am modeling for LEED. It might be simpler and easier if Calculating the annual energy consumption for snowmelting system separately, and somehow adding it to heating load from eQUEST. 
Did you know ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G mentions anything about snowmelting? I haven't found yet...

Jon,

What if I assume the building is purchasing seam and chilled water from
campus facility, therefore I am using steam meter and chilled water meter (
G3.1.1.1 and TABLE 11.3.2A).
At the same time, I am wondering if LEED counts any credit for
campus central plants that corporate renewable energy...

Stanford University provides steam $20.12/1000 lb, chilled water $.3040/
ton-hr and electricity $0.1035/kWh

Hi All,

 

I can't figure out what eQUEST is doing with some DHW loads that I've
assigned to several DHW loops.  I've got 8 water heaters that are also
serving as space heat, providing hot water to coils in PTAC systems.
I've divided a PROCESS-FLOW for DHW proportionally to all of these via a
global parameter.  

At higher flows (like 66 gpm building-wide), all of the PROCESS-FLOW
shows up as hot water gas consumption.  Fine.  But at somewhat lower
flows (45 gpm), the consumption gets split up about half and half
between hot water and "misc. equip."  At even lower flows (20 gpm), the
hot water consumption disappears and only the miscellaneous equip.
consumption remains.  Any idea why?  

 

I've tried assigning this same flow to a separate water heater that is
not serving any space heat loads, and the effect is absent.  Overall,
the combined gas use for the misc. equip. and hot water are the same for
the two schemes.  In addition, space heat gas consumption is the same in
all cases, telling me that the process flow has nothing to do with the
space heat.  

 

What is it about the PROCESS-FLOW on a combined space-heat / hot-water
heater that makes this happen? 

 

Thanks.

TMY2 is the type of weather file DOE2.2 uses for the simulation.  
 
You can access the data using the hourly report feature in equest.  The data
from the TMY2 file is a "Global" variable type.  Hourly reports show up in
the .sim output file after completing a simulation.  You can then use the
"Export Hourly Results" command under the File menu to send that data to a
.csv file.

For projects I have worked on with snowmelt loads, I calculate the energy
consumed by multiplying the snowmelt load by the anticipated runtime hours
(based on bin data of OA Temperature for when the snowmelt system will be
used). The load can then be assigned as a direct load to the natural gas (or
electric) meter under the "Utility & Economics" tab in eQUEST. For
simplification, the load is assigned to a scheudle (I typically just run a
24/7/365 schedule and revise the input load so that I get the same total
annual energy consumed that was calculated for the snowmelt system) and then
assign the load/schedule to an end use category. For snow melt I use the
"Exterior Usage" end use category.

The TMY2 weather file has a flag for snowfall that you can export to excel
to help refine your schedule.

For projects I have worked on with snowmelt loads, I calculate the energy
consumed by multiplying the snowmelt load by the anticipated runtime hours
(based on bin data of OA Temperature for when the snowmelt system will be
used). The load can then be assigned as a direct load to the natural gas (or
electric) meter under the "Utility & Economics" tab in eQUEST. For
simplification, the load is assigned to a scheudle (I typically just run a
24/7/365 schedule and revise the input load so that I get the same total
annual energy consumed that was calculated for the snowmelt system) and then
assign the load/schedule to an end use category. For snow melt I use the
"Exterior Usage" end use category.

Ryan,
 
Yes, I am modeling for LEED. It might be simpler and easier if Calculating
the annual energy consumption for snowmelting system separately, and somehow
adding it to heating load from eQUEST. 
Did you know ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G mentions anything about
snowmelting? I haven't found yet...

Hi, everyone! 

Does anyone know how to model Snow-melt System with eQUEST?

The building I am modeling has radiant snowmelt systems at the basement
floor.

Please let me know if anyone has modeled before or has any idea.

 

Thank you

Yes, 90.1 does mention snowmelt in the first paragraph of Table G3.1.
The way I've done it is in Excel and then add it to the eQuest numbers.


 

That being said, I'd love to figure out a way to model it in eQuest.
Could it be done as a process load?

LEED has approved the use of addenda to A90.1-2004 so Addendum 'ac' can
be applied. The change to the Appendix G fan power formula was not
included in an addendum because it occurred while 90.1 was still
considered 'informative,' not 'normative,' as the currently proposed
Addendum 'r' to A90.1-2007 is proposing to change. I believe the change
to the fan power formula, however, was approved by LEED in a CIR, so you
should be able to apply the new formula and pressure credits for the
Appendix G PRM.

Mike and Andrew,

That is Addendum R that Andrew is referring to. It is actually
Addendum
R to 90.1, 2007. Even though 2007 has not been published yet, ASHRAE
is
already up to Addendum R. As for the calculation, Andrew made a good
catch. It is a typo and should read   CFM x 0.00094 + A  and CFM x
0.0013 + A.

I think you mean to be referencing ASHRAE 90.1-2004 addendum ac not
addendum
r which includes two new methods for calculating fan power limits. 
The
first looks at total Motor HP which isn't very useful for energy
modeling
purposes and the second looks at fan brake-horsepower.  The fan
brake-horsepower equations are "(CFM x 0.00094) + A"  and "(CFM x
0.0013) +
A" for constant volume and variable volume systems respectively.  CFM
is
the
design airflow rate and A is the brakehorse power adjustement for
various
pressure drop adjustments given in Table 6.5.3.1.1B.

I was wondering if anyone out there can explain the new calculation
shown
for baseline fan brake horsepower in Table G3.1.2.9 of Addendum R to
ASHRAE
90.1-2004?  At first glance, the equation doesn't make sense because
you
are
subtracting a relatively small number (0.0013+A) from a large number
(CFMs)
leaving you with a ridiculously large baseline fan motor brake
horsepower.
Am I just reading this wrong or is there a typo?  Isn't there an
easier
way
out there to calculate baseline fan energy (please see version 1 of
Appendix
G for another confusing calculation)?

The USGBC will now accept all addenda to ASHRAE 90.1-2004.  See the
following thread for the announcement from Gail Stranske of CTG
Energetics.

http://www.gard.com/ml/bldg-sim-archive/msg03923.html

I don't know about ASHRAE 90.1-2007 though as to when it will be
officially released and when USGBC will adopt it.

Addendum R

Mike and Andrew,

That is Addendum R that Andrew is referring to. It is actually Addendum
R to 90.1, 2007. Even though 2007 has not been published yet, ASHRAE is
already up to Addendum R. As for the calculation, Andrew made a good
catch. It is a typo and should read   CFM x 0.00094 + A  and CFM x
0.0013 + A.

I think you mean to be referencing ASHRAE 90.1-2004 addendum ac not
addendum
r which includes two new methods for calculating fan power limits.  The
first looks at total Motor HP which isn't very useful for energy
modeling
purposes and the second looks at fan brake-horsepower.  The fan
brake-horsepower equations are "(CFM x 0.00094) + A"  and "(CFM x
0.0013) +
A" for constant volume and variable volume systems respectively.  CFM is
the
design airflow rate and A is the brakehorse power adjustement for
various
pressure drop adjustments given in Table 6.5.3.1.1B.

I was wondering if anyone out there can explain the new calculation
shown
for baseline fan brake horsepower in Table G3.1.2.9 of Addendum R to
ASHRAE
90.1-2004?  At first glance, the equation doesn't make sense because you
are
subtracting a relatively small number (0.0013+A) from a large number
(CFMs)
leaving you with a ridiculously large baseline fan motor brake
horsepower.
Am I just reading this wrong or is there a typo?  Isn't there an easier
way
out there to calculate baseline fan energy (please see version 1 of
Appendix
G for another confusing calculation)?

Andrew,
I believe you are referencing addenum 'r' to ASHRAE 90.1-2007, and
yes,
it appears to be a typo. I have not seen the official 90.1-2007
version
other than in the public review draft for addendum r, but a previous
proposed revision to Appendix G (see attached excerpt from a LEED CIR)
shows CFMs being multiplied by the coefficient before being added to A
(which are the pressure credits per 90.1-2004 addendum 'ac' that is
available on the ASHRAE website). This is the method I have been
using...Is there an easier way? Not that I'm aware of, but I'd love to
know if anyone else is interpreting this differently.

I was able to do right click to access help.
But to my surprise, when I click on any hyperlink on the help page, it

I was able to click on the right side help menu, but cannot click on any

I have reinstalled several time with different version of eQuest, but I

Any solutions to this?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQuest:  Auto-sizing of Cooling Coils and Pumps and its Impact on Temperature Differential
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710241550.AA5017625pd80003923044@gard.com>

Greetings,

 

I am modeling the energy savings associated with various energy conservation
measures and would like to have the chilled water system components
autosize.  I have left most fields in their default settings - 44?F CHW
supply, 10?F CHW and CW temperature differentials, VSD on the CHW pump,
nothing in the capacity fields for pumps, chillers, or cooling towers.  I
have consistent CHW temperature differential requirement of 10?F among
cooling coils, the chiller loop attachment sheet, and the chilled water loop
sheet.  Here's the kicker - when I look at hourly reports of supply and
return chilled water temperatures, the temperature differential is greater
than 20?F and the CHW flowrates are less than half of what they should be.
The total loop load and chilled water supply temperature are what I would
expect, but the pumping energy is being underestimated.  

 

Has anyone run into this one yet?  You would only see this incongruity if
you were to look at hourly reports for chilled water loops.  The problem
appears to lie in the autosizing of the cooling coils.

 

I fiddled with the cooling coil sizing ratio, and I achieved my 10?F
temperature differential when the sizing ratio was set at 2.60.
Unfortunately this also increased the pump size, which raises the minimum
flowrate through the variable primary flow chiller.  I tried to limit the
maximum flow of the pump using size ratio fields, but these need to be ?1.0.
I can enter the selection flowrate of the pump and I get the right
temperature differential, but the minimum flow through the chiller appears
to be based on the flow the loop would calculate when the pump is autosized.
There is a brute-force method of doing this, which is to specify the minimum
flow ratio based on the flows listed in the error message and to specify the
pump size.  Given the number of separate runs I need to do, I'd like to not
have to do this.

 

To complicate things, this model also has free cooling on the 10?F DT system
and an entirely separate system with a 16?F DT and two centrifugal chillers
in series (45%/55% capacity).  I am having the same cooling coil
autosizing/pump energy issue on the 16?F system.  It seems unlikely that the
use of load management and equipment control techniques necessary for free
cooling and series chillers would result in this error (right?).

 

Thanks for your time,

 

Eric

I'd agree with you Mike.

 

Addendum r revised the reference standard for ARI 340/360 from the 2000
version to the 2004 version in Section 12 Normative References.

 

By the way, the older 1989 version of Standard 90.1 had it right in the
first place using Brake HP and not motor nameplate HP for the fan power
limit. It only took them about 18 years to realize they had a problem.
Better late than never.

 

Also the added credits or adjustment factors were long overdue too.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] New Calculation method for Baseline Fan Energy in
Addendum R

 

I think you mean to be referencing ASHRAE 90.1-2004 addendum ac not
addendum r which includes two new methods for calculating fan power
limits.  The first looks at total Motor HP which isn't very useful for
energy modeling purposes and the second looks at fan brake-horsepower.
The fan brake-horsepower equations are "(CFM x 0.00094) + A"  and "(CFM
x 0.0013) + A" for constant volume and variable volume systems
respectively.  CFM is the design airflow rate and A is the brakehorse
power adjustement for various pressure drop adjustments given in Table
6.5.3.1.1B.

I was wondering if anyone out there can explain the new calculation
shown for baseline fan brake horsepower in Table G3.1.2.9 of Addendum R
to ASHRAE 90.1-2004?  At first glance, the equation doesn't make sense
because you are subtracting a relatively small number (0.0013+A) from a
large number (CFMs) leaving you with a ridiculously large baseline fan
motor brake horsepower.  Am I just reading this wrong or is there a
typo?  Isn't there an easier way out there to calculate baseline fan
energy (please see version 1 of Appendix G for another confusing
calculation)?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710241156.AA5614546pd80003917248@gard.com>

I am encountering errors while trying to run an eQuest simulation for
Title 24.  My HVAC systems are gas-fired furnaces with DX cooling, and I
have water-to-water heat exchangers for DHW (one storage & one
instantaneous), and the errors are:

Set Budget zone HW loop: CRule::Eval() error posting symbolic (value
3.60632e-224) result to BDL

Set Budget HW loop: CRule::Eval() error posting symbolic (value
1.41756e-225) result to BDL

 

It certainly looks like the value is trying to go to zero.  I searched
the BDL file and can't find the word "budget".  Where do I look to be
able to fix this? (And how?)

 

Thanks.

Not sure how eQuest would handle this but could you not create an
electric boiler that is essentially the electric chiller acting as a
heater (COP of 3 versus 1) to simulate that and have a single heating
piping loop. Secondary boiler would be the purchased steam. Custom
boiler curves to simulate the electric chiller as a heater/heat pump
over a range of temperatures. Just a thought.

It sounds like you may not have specified a pump for your chilled water
loop. Check the loop and see if you have a pump assigned to it. You'll
need to be mindful of your pump energy to make sure you're not
overshooting what your actual system configuration will use.

Dear all
 
I am trying to simulate a four pipe system with heat pump chillers
providing cooling in summer and heating in winter and purchased steam as
supplemental heating source.I planed to build two loops for the project.
One for chilled water , another for hot water. But heat pump chillers
can only be attached to chilled water loop or two pipe loop , not hot
water loop. So I built one chilled water loop for cooling and one two
pipe loop for heating . But there is always a error message " the
chilled water loop has zero flow rate". It seemed a two pipe loop can
not be build together with other type of loop ,such as chilled water
loop or hot water loop. I have no idea of it . I want to know how to
simulate such a system. Thank you in advance.

I'm filling in a LEED 2.2 template for Appendix G, and there is a
question that asks "number of defaults overridden" I can't find an
explanation for what this means. What defaults are they asking for here?
Most eQUEST models have a lot of defaults overridden - I'm guessing the
good folks at ASHRAE don't want me to enumerate all of these. So what
are they looking for here?

Subject: Floating Point Error from Glass Conductance

 

Has anyone else experienced a floating point error during loads
calculations when changing the value of GLASS-CONDUCT?  I started with a
value of 1.6, then changed to 0.46.  The GLASS-CONDUCT = 1.6 runs fine,
but the GLASS-CONDUCT = 0.46 crashes during the loads program due to a
floating point error ?K-02.?  I double- and triple-checked, and these
glass conductance values are the only changes between runs.  Actually,
trying other values showed than it didn?t stop crashing until the
conductance got as high as about 1.2.  So much for decent windows!

 

I have done several models before in which glass conductance was varied
to show savings between different window products, but this has never
happened to me.  Any help is appreciated!

 

Thanks,

Kristin

should combine them since eQuest will not accept two different size pumps in
the same loop. I don't have the system curve. Is there a way to handle this?

Look in the text file *.bdl

The erroneous wall components should be highlighted there so that you
can identify and remedy them within eQuest.

Hi Kevin,
 
Several things I look at when trying to limit the unmet hours in a building:
 
1.  First of all, look at SS-R and SS-F reports to get a better handle on what is going on, is there simultaneous heating and cooling during the winter?  If so, the tstat setpoints may be too close.
 
2.  Do you have the economizer turned on during the winter for "free cooling" and to limit the use of mechanical cooling?This is accomplished through the OA schedule, see the help screen.  Often a separate schedule is needed for each AHU.  To turn the economizer on but limit the OA during unoccupied periods, use a 0.01 as the fraction.  If you turn it to 0.0, you turn off the ecenomizer completely.
 
3.  During the winter, you may be able to set the cooling setpoint slightly higher to limit the use of mechanical heating; i.e. say up to 78 or 80 instead of 75.
 
4.  Is your OA turned off during optimal start periods or periods when you are trying to bring the spaces back to occupied temeratures?
 
5.  If there are unmet heating hours during the summer, do you have the tstat setpoints set back to say 55F so that heating doesn't come on?
 
All of the above involve schedules.  Keep in mind that the schedules must be identical in both the proposed and budget buildings.
 
I hope this helps and best of luck to you.

Dear All,

 

I would like some guidance concerning methodologies for systematically meeting unmet hour requirements as indicated in ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G3.1.2.2.  When all building systems are believed to be correctly entered and unmet hours are out of range.  I know I can make certain changes to this model to obtain less than 300 unmet hours.  Is there any unspoken hierarchy of steps to input changes?  Or is it all just guesswork?  Is there anything that is a no-no and should not be changed?  Specifically, I have a project in which the building energy management system allows cooling when the temperature is above 55?F leading to several thousand unmet hours for this heating dominated building with unusually high insulation and solar transmittance values and way oversized existing equipment.  If I making cooling available year round then gone, all better.  Of course there is that graph that shows how cooling in the winter is over half the cooling in used in summertime.  Or should I go through each zone and systematically  change occupancies, equipment wattages, outside airflows, bogus baseboard heating (anything else I can fit in here) and then do several hundred iterations of simulations until someday I may finally have under 300 unmet hours for this ... standard.  Do I even need to meet this 300 hours, for LEED purposes I would have to, correct?

 

Yours thoughts, PLEASE?

Kevin -

 

You may well have tried this, but a first cut at it would be to check out the SS-R reports for any seriously offending zones. If there are any, find the LS-B report for each of those zones and see if any of the components of the maximum load stand out as large contributors and adjust the specifications of those components, if it seems reasonable to do so. If it's any consolation, I am in the throes of the same exercise and it is reminiscent of trying to hold a fistful of eels - very frustrating. I will be very interested to see what anyone may have to say about getting a variance on the 300 hours. I'm also very concerned about running into the same (or worse) situation when trying to get the baseline the match within 50 unmet-load hours of the proposed building. Thanks for posing these questions.

Dear Nick 
I am currently working on a similar kind of project and I think that you are going to need to use CFD to determine accurately the amount of air that goes from one zone to the next above for a few different summer conditions and then feed that back in TAS. That's would be a simple and limited approach though.
Much better, in order to determine the overheating conditions accurately , i would run a transient CFD model over a whole day (I don't think that in the UK you would have overheating at night like here in Brisbane) , and increase the external heat loads applied to the Boundaries until you get overheating. Then I would compare this model with TAS and check when these kind of heat loads are happening over a whole year period. The hours that your heat loads are superior to the overheating conditions in your cfd model are your overheating hours. Simple in theory and if you have a good CFD software ...
It's really important in these case to run transient CFD problem since the airflow patterns determined by cfd have a huge impact on thermal comfort and transient phenomena (thermal storage ) have a huge impact on your airflow patterns...
All the best!

Subject: atrium natural ventilation

Hi, I wonder if anyone can give some advice on this one.  My colleagues
and I are considering a naturally ventilated atrium in the UK.  We're
trying to establish appropriate opening areas at top and bottom to limit
summertime overheating conditions.  At the moment we are using Tas for
this analysis but now suspect its bulk air movement calculations
are not sophisticated enough to model the stratification in the space.

The atrium is occupied at the ground floor and extends up four stories,
it has been zoned into four horizontal slices.  Rather than showing an
increase with height of air temperature we see the opposite - the lower
zone is warmer than the upper zones.  Maybe the ground floor zone has a
higher sensible gain due to the occupants but in a high vertical space,
shouldn't the heat rise to the top of the space?  I wonder if Tas is not
considering the convection across the horizontal zone boundaries or is
overestimating the downward air circulation?

Does anyone have experience of using Tas or alternative techniques for
this kind of analysis?  We would prefer to run a dynamic simulation that
can predict annual overheating, rather than a detailed CFD snapshot in
time.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Nick Doylend

PS It would also be interesting to get a show of hands from the Tas
users on this forum - eQUEST seems to be the most popular simulation
tool here judging by the volume of posts.

Subject: RE:  atrium natural ventilation

Nick,
I assume you are modelling a nodal airflow network in TAS, i.e. each
horizontal slice of your atrium is represented by a single node.
That means that buoyancy effects will only be effective on the bulk air
flow through the atrium (upwards if atrium nodes are at a higher air
temperature than external).  That means that at each level (slice), if
you have a net heat loss through the atrium walls, the air will cool as
it rises, which is what you are reporting. To see more complex air flow
effects you would need to include at least two nodes per level, which
would allow air exchange due to localised horizonal air exchanges (not
sure if TAS has this capability; ESP-r does, maybe others), and also the
possibility of an air circulation within the atrium (cooler air
travelling down the external wall, and warmed air up the other side, for
example).  You would have to arrange these nodes intelligently, as you
are making an assumption about how air circulates within the atrium.
ESP-r has a CFD domain for simple (cuboid) spaces, integrated within the
thermal (nodal) nodelling domain, so you could study timewise (dynamic)
evolution of airflows and temperatures.  I'm not aware of other tools
with this capability.
Hope that helps.

I am modeling a 46,200 hotel with a geothermal well heat pump system in
the detailed interface of eQUEST and am running into a few problems. I
am fairly new to the program so please forgive my ignorance. I searched
the previous threads and could not find any solutions and would highly
appreciate any assistance.

=20

*	For heating only zones, there will be electric unit heaters
installed. ASHRAE Std. 90.1-2004 states "Where no cooling system exists
or no cooling system has been specified, the cooling system shall be
identical to the system modeled in the baseline design." For such spaces
I have specified a packaged single zone unit. Specifying electric heat
and a water cooled condenser connected to the GSHP Loop. Is this the
correct approach?

=20

*	When I go to perform a simulation I am prompted with "PUMPd
Error: PUMP design input is unreasonable Check values." The GSHP system
has (2) pumps and I have input their specifications per design. Does
anyone have any suggestions? Could this be due to the electric unit
heaters being modeled with cooling, thus increasing GPM?

=20

*	I am also having trouble with my DHW Loop Pumps. I receive an
error stating: "Pump: DHW Loop Pumps has user specified parameters that
force the mechanical efficiency to be unreasonable. Check input or allow
the program to calculate the kW. Calculated mechanical efficiency=3D
0.071."  Once again I have entered the pumps' specifications per design
documents.

Subject: Complex shading device in Ecotect

Dear All,
As a new user to Ecotect, I would like to know how to model a complex shading device.
   
  I have started by creating a box that is 11' wide and 20'long. The box is 14' in height and has concrete-asphalt on the roof and concrete slab on ground for the floor. The walls are timber frame except the south wall which is single glazed_alum frame.
  I would like to find out the shading percentage on a particular day of an integrated system which includes overhangs or external louvres at unequal spacing or angled louvres supported by fins on either side.
   
  The shading mask seems to believe that the window is 100% shaded at all times. However, in a climate like Houston which is the site for this Ecotect experiment and the device including 12 inch fins on either side and 12 inch depth overhangs above 10ft from the floor is certainly inadequate.
   
  Please feel free to send your suggestions.
   
  Thanks,
  Ruju.

Sam and others,

 

I have a follow-up question related to your response on 9/25 to purchased
chilled water and LEED modeling. 

 

I have a baseline building using ASHRAE 90.1 System 1 (PTAC Units). The
proposed building is using campus chilled water and fan coil units or water
source heat pumps.  Do I use electric as the source for the PTAC cooling, or
the campus chilled water? Using campus chilled water with PTAC units is not
a realistic option, but it seems like 90.1/LEED requires this (Table 11.3.2A
in 90.1-2004)- would USGBC consider this fuel switching?

 

Also, as a general survey, what are the going rates for campus chilled water
and steam?  I have seen ~$0.70/therm chilled water (generated by absorption
chillers) and $0.35/therm for steam for a college dormitory. I think these
rates will vary by campus and end use.

 

Thanks for your guidance in advance.

Jon,
 
You indicate your baseline system is System 1 - PTAC. I assume this is
per Table G3.1.1A in Appendix G. If you are simulating building energy
performance per Appendix G (i.e. LEED), then your baseline cooling type
would be Direct Expansion per Table G3.1.1B. Your proposed design
cooling source will be chilled water and you will be comparing it to a
baseline that is using electricity to provide DX cooling. Table G3.1.3.7
referenced in the original email from Yoko only applies if your baseline
system per Appendix G is System 7 or 8, so it is possible to compare a
baseline DX system with a proposed design on a campus chilled water
loop.
 
Table 11.3.2A is only applicable to the Energy Cost Budget approach
used to demonstrate compliance with A90.1. This is not applicable to
LEED unless you are only trying to meet Prerequisite 2 (now largely
irrelevant unless your project was registered before June 26, 2007 and
doesn't have to meet the mandatory EA Credit 1 - 2 points). If however,
this is the path you are on, then you would need to select your baseline
per Figure 11.3.2. System 1 as defined in Chapter 11 is a VAV w/fan
powered boxes. Based on your proposed design system description, it
looks like you would be using System 6 per Chapter 11.

Gidday=20
=20
We have run into issues like this before with Ecotect - to the point
where I now have a KISS (Keep it simple Stupid) lecture in reserve for
my students to review the difference between visual and mathematical
modelling
=20
Only guessing, because I have not encountered this specific issue. But I
suspect that this is also one of these visual logic vs mathematical
model issues. For example, we had students who have in the past with a
school gymnasium modelled some bleachers / upper level spectator area
using the same tools they modelled the general gym form. With the simple
gym form, the sound ray trace worked believably. With the extra seating
area modelleed so that it looked visually acceptable, the sound stayed
inside the bleacher/balcony form. What had happened was that a second
zone (bleacher) had been created inside the first (gym)  zone and the
acoustic (mathematical) model just worked on the inner zone definition,
no matter where in the larger, outer zone the visuals showed the sound
source to have been placed.=20
=20
I am imagining that there is a mathematical model (lumen method?)
linking your 'simple box' zone to the sky definition; adding another
'roof' zone that appears visually 'above' the first 'simple box' zone
does not remove that mathematical link. You would need explicitly to
change the horizontal window definition to be some form of interzone
device...=20
=20
At some point in these type of calc's you might consider that the
Ecotect quick calculation model has reached its limits and then you
would use it to export to a more capable modeller - the new Control
panel in Ecotect is a great way of running Radiance!?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710191423.AA2340484pd80003897295@gard.com>

Jon, Bill, Sam, et. al.;

For LEED EA Cr1, and EPACT analyses, the method should be Appendix G
Performance Rating, not Chapter 11 Energy Cost Budget. Appendix G  has
its own tables and sections, which lay out the "Baseline."

 

Comparing campus CHW costs with electric cost for DX seems to be what
App G requires if you are modeling dorm rooms with fan coils, but this
raises a host of problems with extra costs (CUP amortization and O&M)
which may be included in CHW rate but not in the DX system's electric
rate. But an ill-considered CIR re-iterated that's how it should be
done. This method appears to conflict one of the prime directives of
baseline and budget comparisons: 

 

G2 SIMULATION GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

G2.1 Performance Calculations. The proposed building

performance and baseline building performance shall be calculated

using the following:

(a) the same simulation program,

(b) the same weather data, and

(c) the same energy rates.

 

I think there are proposals to allow accounting for just the energy
costs embodied in the CHW, however the ones I've heard of would also
require "modeling" a portion of the campus CUP and distribution system
even though it is outside the scope of the project and associated CDs
(which was a limiting prime directive of any code-centered building
simulation). USGBC does already recognize that for cogen CUPs.
(https://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=1354 ). I bet the EA Cr1
reviewers are allowing modeling of campus CUP, under the "existing HVAC
systems" clause, expanded in scope from the CIR that allowed modeling of
a portion of a new high school and part of the associated chiller plant.
The LEED ref guide for EA Cr1 vaguely refers to using the "existing HVAC
system, such as a central plant on campus?" in a paragraph that is
sandwiched between two other paras specifically about baseline
definitions, so it appears to be discussing baseline model system
definition. However, the referenced text in ASHRAE applies only to the
proposed building model.

 

I think App G should return to the ECB methodology for building
heat/cool source (CHW vs. CHW, steam vs. steam) in all cases, but LEED
should have a separate (easier) EA Cr1 points scale for campus
CUP-served buildings. Maybe combined with a separate "LEED for CUPs"! 

 

Sorry if this isn't helpful.  I guess folks disagree about what a fair
revision to this would be. If anyone wants to comment to ASHRAE on
Appendix G, now is the time. Go to
http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/331#672 and download the 90.1-2007
Addendum R zip file under Oct 12-Nov 26 public review. This includes
forms and instructions for suggesting specific changes. Below is the
forward to the addendum:

 

FOREWORD 

This addendum changes Informative Appendix G Performance Rating Method
into a Normative Appendix. Additionally, some language has been modified
to make the Appendix Enforceable. 

Please note that the entire content of this Appendix is open for public
comment as the entire Appendix is changing from Informative to
Normative. 

Note: In this addendum, changes to the current standard are indicated in
the text by underlining (for additions) and strikethrough (for
deletions) unless the instructions specifically mention some other means
of indicating the changes. In addition, the remainder of the text is
open for public comment.

 

Do we need a separate mailing list for baseline (LEED, ASHRAE, EPACT,
IRS, GGHC, Labs21!) banter? Is this what building simulation has come
to? This is what my lunch break has come to.

We have run into issues like this before with Ecotect - to the point
where I now have a KISS (Keep it simple Stupid) lecture in reserve for
my students to review the difference between visual and mathematical
modelling
 
Only guessing, because I have not encountered this specific issue. But I
suspect that this is also one of these visual logic vs mathematical
model issues. For example, we had students who have in the past with a
school gymnasium modelled some bleachers / upper level spectator area
using the same tools they modelled the general gym form. With the simple
gym form, the sound ray trace worked believably. With the extra seating
area modelleed so that it looked visually acceptable, the sound stayed
inside the bleacher/balcony form. What had happened was that a second
zone (bleacher) had been created inside the first (gym)  zone and the
acoustic (mathematical) model just worked on the inner zone definition,
no matter where in the larger, outer zone the visuals showed the sound
source to have been placed. 
 
I am imagining that there is a mathematical model (lumen method?)
linking your 'simple box' zone to the sky definition; adding another
'roof' zone that appears visually 'above' the first 'simple box' zone
does not remove that mathematical link. You would need explicitly to
change the horizontal window definition to be some form of interzone
device... 
 
At some point in these type of calc's you might consider that the
Ecotect quick calculation model has reached its limits and then you
would use it to export to a more capable modeller - the new Control
panel in Ecotect is a great way of running Radiance!?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Ecotect skylights


My students are working on skylighting designs for simple models in
Ecotect. They are starting with a simple box with no windows. They
insert a horizontal window into the ceiling plane. Illuminance
calculations look reasonable. They then insert a roof zone on top of the
box, intending to eventually make a 'lay-light' scheme. But before
inserting any glazing into the roof zone, they run the illuminance calcs
to check the roof was inserted properly - expecting to see no daylight
in the lower box. Yet there is a low level wash on the interior. 
 
Anyone run into this before? Any suggestions?

Jon,
 
You indicate your baseline system is System 1 - PTAC. I assume this is
per Table G3.1.1A in Appendix G. If you are simulating building energy
performance per Appendix G (i.e. LEED), then your baseline cooling type
would be Direct Expansion per Table G3.1.1B. Your proposed design
cooling source will be chilled water and you will be comparing it to a
baseline that is using electricity to provide DX cooling. Table G3.1.3.7
referenced in the original email from Yoko only applies if your baseline
system per Appendix G is System 7 or 8, so it is possible to compare a
baseline DX system with a proposed design on a campus chilled water
loop.
 
Table 11.3.2A is only applicable to the Energy Cost Budget approach
used to demonstrate compliance with A90.1. This is not applicable to
LEED unless you are only trying to meet Prerequisite 2 (now largely
irrelevant unless your project was registered before June 26, 2007 and
doesn't have to meet the mandatory EA Credit 1 - 2 points). If however,
this is the path you are on, then you would need to select your baseline
per Figure 11.3.2. System 1 as defined in Chapter 11 is a VAV w/fan
powered boxes. Based on your proposed design system description, it
looks like you would be using System 6 per Chapter 11.

Sam and others,
 
I have a follow-up question related to your response on 9/25 to
purchased chilled water and LEED modeling. 
 
I have a baseline building using ASHRAE 90.1 System 1 (PTAC Units). The
proposed building is using campus chilled water and fan coil units or
water source heat pumps.  Do I use electric as the source for the PTAC
cooling, or the campus chilled water? Using campus chilled water with
PTAC units is not a realistic option, but it seems like 90.1/LEED
requires this (Table 11.3.2A in 90.1-2004)- would USGBC consider this
fuel switching?
 
Also, as a general survey, what are the going rates for campus chilled
water and steam?  I have seen ~$0.70/therm chilled water (generated by
absorption chillers) and $0.35/therm for steam for a college dormitory.
I think these rates will vary by campus and end use.
 
Thanks for your guidance in advance.

Yoko,
In note 5 under Table 11.3.2A, 90.1-2004 says for systems using
purchased chilled water, no chillers shall be modeled and CHW costs
shall be determined using the adopting authority?s utility rates.  For
both the baseline and proposed buildings, you would not include central

Hi, everyone,

 

I am modeling a building that is served chilled water from a central
chiller, and the building doesn't have any individual chiller. 

I am wondering if  the baseline model (by ASHRAE 90.1-2004) should
follow ASHRAE specified "type and number of chillers" (TABLE G3.1.3.7,
ASHRAE 90.1-2004) depending on building conditioned floor area, or it
should be modeled with a Central chiller as proposed/designed model.  

 

Thank you for your help

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710181747.AA4746734pd80003892587@gard.com>

Hi,

eQuest is giving us an error when modeling a chiller plant that has a high
delta-T.  The chilled water temps are 41?F / 57?F, and the anticipated
discharge temp off the coil is 55?F.  This would be accomplished by a
relatively deep coil.  eQuest does not like the fact that the return CHW
Temp is higher than the leaving air temp.  It would like to see at least a
6?F approach between the two.  

 

Any suggestions on how to satisfy eQuest while maintaining a good simulation
of the CHW pumping energy and chiller compressor performance?

 

Thanks for any suggestions.

 

Sincerely,
Alec Stevens, PE, LEED AP

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710181539.AA3941312pd80003889238@gard.com>

Dear All,
As a new user to Ecotect, I would like to know how to model a complex shading device.
   
  I have started by creating a box that is 11' wide and 20'long. The box is 14' in height and has concrete-asphalt on the roof and concrete slab on ground for the floor. The walls are timber frame except the south wall which is single glazed_alum frame.
  I would like to find out the shading percentage on a particular day of an integrated system which includes overhangs or external louvres at unequal spacing or angled louvres supported by fins on either side.
   
  The shading mask seems to believe that the window is 100% shaded at all times. However, in a climate like Houston which is the site for this Ecotect experiment and the device including 12 inch fins on either side and 12 inch depth overhangs above 10ft from the floor is certainly inadequate.
   
  Please feel free to send your suggestions.
   
  Thanks,
  Ruju.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710181301.AA0137687pd80003888101@gard.com>

I am modeling a 46,200 hotel with a geothermal well heat pump system in
the detailed interface of eQUEST and am running into a few problems. I
am fairly new to the program so please forgive my ignorance. I searched
the previous threads and could not find any solutions and would highly
appreciate any assistance.

 

*	For heating only zones, there will be electric unit heaters
installed. ASHRAE Std. 90.1-2004 states "Where no cooling system exists
or no cooling system has been specified, the cooling system shall be
identical to the system modeled in the baseline design." For such spaces
I have specified a packaged single zone unit. Specifying electric heat
and a water cooled condenser connected to the GSHP Loop. Is this the
correct approach?

 

*	When I go to perform a simulation I am prompted with "PUMPd
Error: PUMP design input is unreasonable Check values." The GSHP system
has (2) pumps and I have input their specifications per design. Does
anyone have any suggestions? Could this be due to the electric unit
heaters being modeled with cooling, thus increasing GPM?

 

*	I am also having trouble with my DHW Loop Pumps. I receive an
error stating: "Pump: DHW Loop Pumps has user specified parameters that
force the mechanical efficiency to be unreasonable. Check input or allow
the program to calculate the kW. Calculated mechanical efficiency=
0.071."  Once again I have entered the pumps' specifications per design
documents.

 

Thank you,

Nick,
I assume you are modelling a nodal airflow network in TAS, i.e. each
horizontal slice of your atrium is represented by a single node.
That means that buoyancy effects will only be effective on the bulk air
flow through the atrium (upwards if atrium nodes are at a higher air
temperature than external).  That means that at each level (slice), if
you have a net heat loss through the atrium walls, the air will cool as
it rises, which is what you are reporting. To see more complex air flow
effects you would need to include at least two nodes per level, which
would allow air exchange due to localised horizonal air exchanges (not
sure if TAS has this capability; ESP-r does, maybe others), and also the
possibility of an air circulation within the atrium (cooler air
travelling down the external wall, and warmed air up the other side, for
example).  You would have to arrange these nodes intelligently, as you
are making an assumption about how air circulates within the atrium.
ESP-r has a CFD domain for simple (cuboid) spaces, integrated within the
thermal (nodal) nodelling domain, so you could study timewise (dynamic)
evolution of airflows and temperatures.  I'm not aware of other tools
with this capability.
Hope that helps.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] atrium natural ventilation

Hi, I wonder if anyone can give some advice on this one.  My colleagues
and I are considering a naturally ventilated atrium in the UK.  We're
trying to establish appropriate opening areas at top and bottom to limit
summertime overheating conditions.  At the moment we are using Tas for
this analysis but now suspect its bulk air movement calculations are not
sophisticated enough to model the stratification in the space.

The atrium is occupied at the ground floor and extends up four stories,
it has been zoned into four horizontal slices.  Rather than showing an
increase with height of air temperature we see the opposite - the lower
zone is warmer than the upper zones.  Maybe the ground floor zone has a
higher sensible gain due to the occupants but in a high vertical space,
shouldn't the heat rise to the top of the space?  I wonder if Tas is not
considering the convection across the horizontal zone boundaries or is
overestimating the downward air circulation?

Does anyone have experience of using Tas or alternative techniques for
this kind of analysis?  We would prefer to run a dynamic simulation that
can predict annual overheating, rather than a detailed CFD snapshot in
time.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Nick Doylend

PS It would also be interesting to get a show of hands from the Tas
users on this forum - eQUEST seems to be the most popular simulation
tool here judging by the volume of posts.

Hello,
 
I have run into an error message after simulation that prevents
simulation results from being compiled and displayed.  Just before the
simulation creates the hourly reports, four error messages appear each
with the following format: "Error retrieving EG_MoEU_ED CSV simulation
results for table 'Electric Consumption (kWh)' (returned -3)."  The
additional errors reference 'Gas Consumption (kBtu),' 'Electric Demand
(kW),' and 'Gas Demand (Btu/h).'  After clearing the error windows, the
simulation completes "successfully," but no simulation output file is
created for the run.  These error headings correspond to the graphic
report headings that eQUEST automatically creates, and no data is
recorded in the graphic report interface.  I have looked for errors in
the .inp and .BDL files, but I have not found anything.  Is there any
place that I can reconcile this error in order to retrieve the
simulation output?  
 
Thanks,

Thanks Xiaobing
 
In reviewing some past heat pump projects, I see that the way we have been doing it is in agreement with modeling the supply fan separately, and using the manufacturer's published EIR/COP values to compute the cooling/heating EIRs without adjustment.  
 
A problem many of us have in supervising modeling projects is backchecking...modifying manufacturer's published data creates a variance in the documentation and backcheck processes that needs to be addressed consistently for every project going forward.  Thus when modifying manufacturer's published heat pump EIR/COP values was suggested to be necessary for LEED compliance, I wanted to go through the justification exercise <http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/2007/10/heat-pump-parametrics.html>  of why we generally don't.
 
Dead horse beaten, as far as I'm concerned!

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Heat Pump COP


Brandon:
 
Thanks for your continuous effort to discuss the issue of heat pump COP and the fan power. Just want to clarify several things cited in your e-mails.
 
1. The fan power included in the EER/COP calculation may not be the same as the fan actually demand when the heat pump runs. For water-source heat pumps, ANSI/ARI/ASHRAE ISO Standard 13256-1:1998 (Water-source heat pumps - testing and rating for performance - Part 1: Water-to-air and brine-to-air heat pump) states following requirements for fan power input in COP/EER calculations
 
4.1.2 Power input of fans for heat pumps without duct connection
In the case of heat pumps which are not designed for duct connection and which are equipped with an integral fan, all power consumed by the fans shall be included in the effective power input to the heat pump.

4.1.3 Power input of fans for heat pumps with duct connection

4.1.3.2 If a fan is an integral part of a heat pump, only the portion of the fan power required to overcome the internal resistance shall be included in the effective power input to the heat pump. The fraction which is to be excluded from the total power consumed by the fan shall be calculated using the following formula: ?fa = q x ?p / ?

where

?fa is the fan power adjustment, in watts;

? = 0.3 ? 103 by convention;

?p is the measured external static pressure difference, in pascals;

q is the nominal airflow rate, in litres per second.

This value shall be subtracted from the heating capacity and added to the cooling capacity.

The reason for this is that, in a particular heat pump installation, depending on the air flow and external static pressure of the duct work, the fan power is different, which is unknown when the heat pump is tested in the lab. So, to isolate from the unknown effect of the external duct work, only the portion of the fan power required to overcome the internal resistance shall be included in the effective power input to the heat pump if the heat pump is designed for duct connection. Therefore, the fan power in the real operating condition should be specified in the simulation to more accurately predict the fan energy consumption. 

2. The electric consumption of fan depends on not only the fan power (which may be less than 10% of the compressor power) but also the run time of the fan. In the case of mild climate, if fan runs continuously (to provide OA and air circulation in the conditioned space), the electric consumed by fan may be higher than the compressor power since fan runs 8760 hours a year but the cumulative run time of compressor over a year may be less than 1000 hours. Whether the fan power play an important role in energy analysis does not necessarily depends on the size of heat pump, it depends on what the system is (i.e. single small heat pump or multiple small heat pumps connected with a water loop) and how the indoor fan of the heat pump is operated (continuous or intermittently).  For this reason, it is recommended to use DOAS for WLHP system so that the indoor fan of the heat pump can run intermittently to take care the space loads while the DOAS delivers the required amount of OA to the space.

Hope it helps,

Xiaobing

	OK All, 
	 
	Has anyone looked at this lovely document <http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/residential/pdfs/cac_tp_101105.pdf> , which is the Department of Energy's test procedure for air conditioners and heat pumps to determine EER and SEER?  To this I turned to answer the burning question "what is the standard external fan static pressure drop specified to calculate EER and SEER?"
	 
	Seems to me after wading through the swamp of equations in the back of the document that fan energy in EER and SEER calculations is specified at a 0.05 inch external static pressure drop.
	 
	So then I started digging around for data to support my intuitive feeling that fan energy is going to be something like 1/10th that of compressor energy on small heat pumps.
	 
	In the process I ran across this nifty DOE/ORNL Heat Pump Design Model <http://www.ornl.gov/?wlj/hpdm/doehpdm.shtml> .  Now we're cooking... see this post <http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/2007/10/heat-pump-parametrics.html>  for a 3D plot of parametric runs (did I say 'nifty'?), varying supply airflow and static pressure, from 600 to 4200 and 0.05 to 0.65 respectively.
	 
	I'm standing by my assertion that supply fan energy does not need to be subtracted from heat pump EER as SEER and the new number recalculated -- playing those kinds of games can lead to an exercise in futility.

	Given the small heatpumps my firm is accustomed to installing, coupled with the fuzzy level of design at which we're doing our preliminary energy studies, the simplification of discounting fan operation when compressors aren't running I think is well within the error bars of the overall study. 

	  

	Which doesn't provide any comfort from the realization that this business gives one plenty of cause to ask where picking the theoretical flyspecs out of manufacturer's published pepper has crossed a threshold of mind-numbingly diminished returns!

	The method cited below only gives correct results if the heat pump fan operates intermittently on a call for heat/cool, and if the fan as installed runs at its ARI-tested power. Otherwise this method greatly under-estimates fan energy, at least for constant speed fans. This is mentioned specifically for App G/ECB models either in the Standard itself or in the UM.

	Good point, John -- but there may be an arguably easier way to not double-count fan energy...following is a reprint from the DOE2 documentation: 


	  


	COOLING-EIR 


	The Electric Input Ratio (EIR), or 1/(Coefficient of Performance), for the cooling unit at ARI rated conditions. The program defines EIR to be the ratio of the electric energy input  to the rated capacity, when both the energy input and rated capacity are expressed in the same units. This EIR is at ARI rated conditions, i.e., without correction for different temperature or part load. 

	Note:  If you include fan electric energy consumption in your value of COOLING-EIR, then you should set SUPPLY-KW/FLOW to zero (and SUPPLY-STATIC, SUPPLY-EFF and SUPPLY-DELTA-T should be omitted). Otherwise, the supply fan electrical energy will be double counted. For commercial systems the default value of COOLING-EIR includes compressor and outdoor fan energy, but not indoor fan energy. 


	HEATING-EIR 


	Electric Input Ratio, or 1/(heating Coefficient of Performance), for the heat pump. This EIR is at ARI rated conditions, i.e., without corrections for temperature or part load. The program-calculated HEATING-EIR does not include fan power and heat. This keyword is appropriate only to HP, RESYS, and PTAC systems.  

	Mysteriously, the HEATING-EIR documentation makes no mention of the fan energy double counting issue.  But if you're consistent and use 3.41 divided by the manufacturers published EER for the cooling EIR, the inverse of the published COP for the heating EIR, and zero-out the supply fan energy as described in the documentaion ...  then Bob's your uncle, right? 

	FWIW, that's the way we do it...

	Yes and no. The energy is "removed," but the COP improves because the fan heat had a COP of 1.0, and is included in the rated gross kW in and Btuh out. I think the T24 ACM may have a "method" or formula.

	Folks: 

	  

	In eQuest, the Energy Input Ratio (EIR) can be derived from EER or COP given for a unit or from a Standard. To correctly model such a unit, one must subtract the fan energy for the unit to obtain the EER (EIR) of the compressor only. This improves the input from, say, a COP of 12.3 to 15. 

	  

	What about in the case of the heat pump heating COP? Must one subtract out the fan energy here as well, thus "worsening" the COP for the heating side? 

	  

	I cannot find anything written on this subject. 

	  

	Thanks.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710161122.AA2214453pd80003874186@gard.com>

Brandon:
 
Thanks for your continuous effort to discuss the issue of heat pump COP and the fan power. Just want to clarify several things cited in your e-mails.
 
1. The fan power included in the EER/COP calculation may not be the same as the fan actually demand when the heat pump runs. For water-source heat pumps, ANSI/ARI/ASHRAE ISO Standard 13256-1:1998 (Water-source heat pumps - testing and rating for performance - Part 1: Water-to-air and brine-to-air heat pump) states following requirements for fan power input in COP/EER calculations
 
4.1.2 Power input of fans for heat pumps without duct connection
In the case of heat pumps which are not designed for duct connection and which are equipped with an integral fan, all power consumed by the fans shall be included in the effective power input to the heat pump.

4.1.3 Power input of fans for heat pumps with duct connection

4.1.3.2 If a fan is an integral part of a heat pump, only the portion of the fan power required to overcome the internal resistance shall be included in the effective power input to the heat pump. The fraction which is to be excluded from the total power consumed by the fan shall be calculated using the following formula: ?fa = q x ?p / ?

where

?fa is the fan power adjustment, in watts;

? = 0.3 ? 103 by convention;

?p is the measured external static pressure difference, in pascals;

q is the nominal airflow rate, in litres per second.

This value shall be subtracted from the heating capacity and added to the cooling capacity.

The reason for this is that, in a particular heat pump installation, depending on the air flow and external static pressure of the duct work, the fan power is different, which is unknown when the heat pump is tested in the lab. So, to isolate from the unknown effect of the external duct work, only the portion of the fan power required to overcome the internal resistance shall be included in the effective power input to the heat pump if the heat pump is designed for duct connection. Therefore, the fan power in the real operating condition should be specified in the simulation to more accurately predict the fan energy consumption. 

2. The electric consumption of fan depends on not only the fan power (which may be less than 10% of the compressor power) but also the run time of the fan. In the case of mild climate, if fan runs continuously (to provide OA and air circulation in the conditioned space), the electric consumed by fan may be higher than the compressor power since fan runs 8760 hours a year but the cumulative run time of compressor over a year may be less than 1000 hours. Whether the fan power play an important role in energy analysis does not necessarily depends on the size of heat pump, it depends on what the system is (i.e. single small heat pump or multiple small heat pumps connected with a water loop) and how the indoor fan of the heat pump is operated (continuous or intermittently).  For this reason, it is recommended to use DOAS for WLHP system so that the indoor fan of the heat pump can run intermittently to take care the space loads while the DOAS delivers the required amount of OA to the space.

Hope it helps,

Xiaobing

A somewhat minor point, but I think you have mis-read the test standard.  The 
0.05 inch ESP is the tolerance allowed under testing conditions, not the actual 
ESP level.  Table 2 on page 59149 shows the minimum ESP for testing ranges from 
0.10 to 0.20, varying as a function of rated capacity.

feeling that fan energy is going to be something like 1/10th that of
compressor energy on small heat pumps.
 
In the process I ran across this nifty DOE/ORNL Heat Pump Design Model
<http://www.ornl.gov/~wlj/hpdm/doehpdm.shtml> .  Now we're cooking...
see this post
<http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/2007/10/heat-pump-parametrics.html>
for a 3D plot of parametric runs (did I say 'nifty'?), varying supply
airflow and static pressure, from 600 to 4200 and 0.05 to 0.65
respectively.
 
I'm standing by my assertion that supply fan energy does not need to be
subtracted from heat pump EER as SEER and the new number recalculated --
playing those kinds of games can lead to an exercise in futility.

Good point Fred, for larger unitary packages and for dialing-in energy

insightful observation.  Scanned all 90.1-2004 but didn't see the

Given the small heatpumps my firm is accustomed to installing, coupled

The method cited below only gives correct results if the heat pump fan
operates intermittently on a call for heat/cool, and if the fan as
installed runs at its ARI-tested power. Otherwise this method greatly
under-estimates fan energy, at least for constant speed fans. This is

Good point, John -- but there may be an arguably easier way to not
double-count fan energy...following is a reprint from the DOE2

This EIR is at ARI rated conditions, i.e., without correction for

Note:  If you include fan electric energy consumption in your value of
COOLING-EIR, then you should set SUPPLY-KW/FLOW to zero (and
SUPPLY-STATIC, SUPPLY-EFF and SUPPLY-DELTA-T should be omitted).
Otherwise, the supply fan electrical energy will be double counted. For
commercial systems the default value of COOLING-EIR includes compressor
and outdoor fan energy, but not indoor fan energy. 


HEATING-EIR 


Electric Input Ratio, or 1/(heating Coefficient of Performance), for the
heat pump. This EIR is at ARI rated conditions, i.e., without
corrections for temperature or part load. The program-calculated
HEATING-EIR does not include fan power and heat. This keyword is
appropriate only to HP, RESYS, and PTAC systems.  

Mysteriously, the HEATING-EIR documentation makes no mention of the fan
energy double counting issue.  But if you're consistent and use 3.41
divided by the manufacturers published EER for the cooling EIR, the
inverse of the published COP for the heating EIR, and zero-out the
supply fan energy as described in the documentaion ...  then Bob's your
uncle, right? 

FWIW, that's the way we do it...

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Heat Pump COP 

Yes and no. The energy is "removed," but the COP improves because the
fan heat had a COP of 1.0, and is included in the rated gross kW in and
Btuh out. I think the T24 ACM may have a "method" or formula.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Heat Pump COP 

Folks: 

  

In eQuest, the Energy Input Ratio (EIR) can be derived from EER or COP
given for a unit or from a Standard. To correctly model such a unit, one
must subtract the fan energy for the unit to obtain the EER (EIR) of the
compressor only. This improves the input from, say, a COP of 12.3 to 15.


  

What about in the case of the heat pump heating COP? Must one subtract
out the fan energy here as well, thus "worsening" the COP for the
heating side? 

  

I cannot find anything written on this subject. 

  

Thanks.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Circulation Loop Fluid Type in eQuest
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710141619.AA1958921pd80003869728@gard.com>

All -

 

DOE2.2 documentation (see below) indicates it is possible to specify
circulation loop fluid properties for fluids other than water (also,
fluid heat capacity is reported in PV-A, which seems to indicate this
parameter should be adjustable). The keywords in the documentation are
FLUID (acceptable values WATER, ETHYLENE-GLYCOL, PROPYLENE-GLYCOL) and
FLUID-CONC (%) to specify fluid type and its concentration. I don't see
any place to specify these parameters in any of the wizards or the
Detailed Design mode. I tried editing the keywords into the definitions
of the CHW and HW circulation loops in the input file, which generated
UNKNOWN KEYWORD errors (curiously, only for the FLUID keyword, not
FLUID-CONC). Does eQuest constrain the user to 100% H2O or is there some
way to affect these values? Is FLUID not the right keyword (FLUID-TYPE
doesn't work)? Should the fluids be defined somewhere other than in the
definition of the circulation loop?

 

Documentation can be found by entering the DOE2 help screen and
selecting CIRCULATION-LOOP in the index, which provides several options
to display. Select "circulation-Loop" (note non-standard capitalization)
and you will get a list of subtopics to select from. Select "Brines" and
from the subtopics at the bottom of the resulting screen, select "Actual
Fluid". The keywords noted above should be available from there.

 

Thanks for any insights.

Call for software demos - eSim 2008

 

21-22 May 2008

Qu?bec City, Canada

www.esim.ca

 

The bi-annual conference of IBPSA-Canada will be held in Qu?bec City, Canada on May 21 and 22, 2008 (pre-conference workshops May 20, 2008). The event will be hosted by l'?cole d'architecture de l'Universit? Laval, in collaboration with the National Research Council Canada.

 

Software companies and individuals are invited to take part in special software demos sessions during the conference. Much like technical presentations, the software demos sessions will consist of presentations in front of an audience. However, these presentations will not be peer-reviewed and therefore not included in the conference proceedings - although the submission of a technical paper on the software that meets one of the conference themes is encouraged! To be eligible for a presentation during the software demo sessions, the software must be a commercial product or be freely available (on a web site for example). Furthermore, the presenter must be a registered participant. Please note that the scientific committee has the right to limit the number of software tools being presented.

 

The deadline to submit a software is November 27, 2007. To submit your software, just click on the "Software Demo Submission" tab on www.esim.ca <http://www.esim.ca/> 

 

Please also be reminded that the deadline for submitting a paper abstract is October 22 - less than 10 days from now!

 

Conference Chair:

Dr. Denis Bourgeois denis.bourgeois at arc.ulaval.ca 

 

Chair of the Scientific Committee:

Dr. Christoph Reinhart christoph.reinhart at nrc-cnrc.gc.ca

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Heat Pump COP 

Yes and no. The energy is "removed," but the COP improves because the
fan heat had a COP of 1.0, and is included in the rated gross kW in and
Btuh out. I think the T24 ACM may have a "method" or formula.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Heat Pump COP 

Folks: 

  

In eQuest, the Energy Input Ratio (EIR) can be derived from EER or COP
given for a unit or from a Standard. To correctly model such a unit, one
must subtract the fan energy for the unit to obtain the EER (EIR) of the
compressor only. This improves the input from, say, a COP of 12.3 to 15.


  

What about in the case of the heat pump heating COP? Must one subtract
out the fan energy here as well, thus "worsening" the COP for the
heating side? 

  

I cannot find anything written on this subject. 

  

Thanks.

Good point Fred, for larger unitary packages and for dialing-in energy
savings rebate studies.  I did say 'arguably', and yours is an
insightful observation.  Scanned all 90.1-2004 but didn't see the
reference you alluded to -- if you can be more specific please advise.
 
Given the small heatpumps my firm is accustomed to installing, coupled
with the fuzzy level of design at which we're doing our preliminary
energy studies, the simplification of discounting fan operation when
compressors aren't running I think is well within the error bars of the
overall study.
 
Which doesn't provide any comfort from the realization that this
business gives one plenty of cause to ask where picking the theoretical
flyspecs out of manufacturer's published pepper has crossed a threshold
of mind-numbingly diminished returns!

The method cited below only gives correct results if the heat pump fan
operates intermittently on a call for heat/cool, and if the fan as
installed runs at its ARI-tested power. Otherwise this method greatly
under-estimates fan energy, at least for constant speed fans. This is
mentioned specifically for App G/ECB models either in the Standard
itself or in the UM.

Good point, John -- but there may be an arguably easier way to not
double-count fan energy...following is a reprint from the DOE2
documentation: 


  


COOLING-EIR 


The Electric Input Ratio (EIR), or 1/(Coefficient of Performance), for
the cooling unit at ARI rated conditions. The program defines EIR to be
the ratio of the electric energy input  to the rated capacity, when both
the energy input and rated capacity are expressed in the same units.
This EIR is at ARI rated conditions, i.e., without correction for
different temperature or part load. 

Note:  If you include fan electric energy consumption in your value of
COOLING-EIR, then you should set SUPPLY-KW/FLOW to zero (and
SUPPLY-STATIC, SUPPLY-EFF and SUPPLY-DELTA-T should be omitted).
Otherwise, the supply fan electrical energy will be double counted. For
commercial systems the default value of COOLING-EIR includes compressor
and outdoor fan energy, but not indoor fan energy. 


HEATING-EIR 


Electric Input Ratio, or 1/(heating Coefficient of Performance), for the
heat pump. This EIR is at ARI rated conditions, i.e., without
corrections for temperature or part load. The program-calculated
HEATING-EIR does not include fan power and heat. This keyword is
appropriate only to HP, RESYS, and PTAC systems.  

Mysteriously, the HEATING-EIR documentation makes no mention of the fan
energy double counting issue.  But if you're consistent and use 3.41
divided by the manufacturers published EER for the cooling EIR, the
inverse of the published COP for the heating EIR, and zero-out the
supply fan energy as described in the documentaion ...  then Bob's your
uncle, right? 

FWIW, that's the way we do it...

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Motor efficiencies when driven by VFD
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710121521.AA213800pd80003859049@gard.com>

I'm looking for data pertaining to the subject.  I found information on
motor efficiencies at various loads, such as from the MotorMaster database
and a couple of research papers.  However, I haven't found clear information
on motor efficiencies when driven by VFDs.  Here are the types of
information that could be useful:

Efficiency vs. load at constant speed (have that for non-VFD applications) 
Efficiency vs. speed at constant load 

I'm also aware that VFDs can be setup different ways, but I don't know much
about this.  I suspect that how the volts per Hz varies impacts the motor
efficiency, so that type of information would also be valuable.

Or are VFD setups for HVAC applications inconsistent, so it is hard to
generalize? 

I am seeking this information because I am working on some spreadsheet
applications for the CEC (that will be available to everyone) for estimating
savings for changes to variable-flow systems (change to pressure setpoints,
resets, etc.)

Any relevant information would be helpful.  I may not be able to incorporate
all the information now, but I'd like to know (and eventually address!) any
shortcomings in my current applications.

Thanks,

Dear all,

Does anyone know if the default North point that Ecotect derives when the
weather file is loaded is magnetic north or true north? I'm guessing it's
true north and hence a model from CAD based on magnetic north needs to be
adjusted accordingly in Ecotect?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Heat Pump COP

Folks:
 
In eQuest, the Energy Input Ratio (EIR) can be derived from EER or COP
given for a unit or from a Standard. To correctly model such a unit, one
must subtract the fan energy for the unit to obtain the EER (EIR) of the
compressor only. This improves the input from, say, a COP of 12.3 to 15.
 
What about in the case of the heat pump heating COP? Must one subtract
out the fan energy here as well, thus "worsening" the COP for the
heating side?
 
I cannot find anything written on this subject.
 
Thanks.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Two-part Appendix G Question regarding locker room facilities
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710091531.AA3137453pd80003852904@gard.com>

 
I am looking for some un-official opinions on an interpretation of Appendix
G .  
 
I am modeling a university stadium facility and the as-designed systems
serving the locker room areas are constant volume reheat with heat recovery.
The intent is that these systems will run continuously for moisture and odor
control.
 
Problem #1 :  Based on the CFA, # of FLRs, and HT Type the baseline system
is System 7 VAV with Reheat.  However G3.1.2.5 states that the minimum
ventilation would need to match the as-designed systems which in this case
would be 100% design airflow.  Does the baseline in this case become
constant volume because I have to maintain the same ventilation in both
models?   Or does minimum outside air ventilation refer to whatever is
required by individual State code regardless of the as-designed case?    
 
My opinion is that the decision to use 100% constant volume outside air is a
design decision rather than a code/standard mandatory requirement.   In this
case minimum ventilation for locker rooms is 0.5 cfm/sq.ft dedicated
exhaust.   The additional energy associated with providing constant 100% OA
greater than 0.5 CFM/sq.ft. should not be included in the Appendix G
baseline,  but rather the baseline should meet the minimum ventilation
requirements of the local state code.      
 
 
Problem #2: How do I resolve the fact that the system will be operated
continuously even though the space isn't occupied? Appendix G says systems
shall run continuously during occupied periods and intermittently during
unoccupied periods.   The locker rooms have low occupancy and therefore if I
only model the systems operating during occupied periods the annual building
energy cost will be significantly lower than reality and the aggregate
effect of other energy efficiency measures will be much greater (ie: the %
cost savings for LEED will be much higher ) because the locker rooms only
account for 20% of the total conditioned floor area but 40-50% of total
energy cost).  
 
Again I am going to argue that operating the systems continuously is a
design decision and not a code/standard regulated requirement.  The
additional energy associated with continuously operating the systems should
be considered "process" energy and included in the baseline.  
 
What does everyone think?  
 
Thanks in advance for your comments.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Modeling packaged VAV with gas heat,
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710091332.AA3245328pd80003851637@gard.com>

All;

Or trying to in DOE-2.2. 

 

As Andrew points out; many or most of these systems operate differently
than the simple constant setpoint, or lack of central heating coil, John
describes. These are the DOE-2 defaults, and will show little or no
central heating unless OA is high and airflow is turn downed
considerably. But with the very common VAV AHU with gas furnace and
electric zone reheat, there is incentive to maximize the use of the
furnace, for a variety of reasons. Also the reference to preheating the
OA is misleading with respect to DOE-2 and most actual packaged VAV
systems, as the preheat is usually in the mixed air. 

 

Note that some VAV RTU furnaces can only be used for warmup, they
actually cannot turndown low enough to allow tempering during normal
occupied operation, and if the mixed air is cold, it will just be sent
down to the electric coils. 

 

For warmup periods, in typical practice the supply air temp is set up to
85 or 95F for a while in the morning until some control (return air, max
or average of zones) signals that this warmup period has been completed.
Numerous variations of box damper control can go along with this (all
stay at minimum; open if below setpoint/close if above). In general the
reheat coils are kept off until the warmup period is over. The warmup
described in the DOE2 documentation merely indicates closing the
economizer, and turning the cooling coil off. As far as I can tell;
DOE-2 cannot directly model the control of the zones and furnace now
typical; and the various workarounds we've tried to mimic it are
brittle, error-prone, kludgy, and/or neglect significant energy terms.
They include:

*  Putting the electric reheat on a loop to elec boiler and turning off
   that loop during warmup. Raising the zone setpoint to occupied during
   the warmup, and then apparently if ALL zones are calling for heat,
   AND if the COOL-CONTROL = WARMEST, the SAT will float up to
   HEAT-SET-T or some temp between HEAT-SET-T and COOL-SET-T. The zone
   min-air in the core zone could be scheduled down to avoid
   overheating?
*  Again putting the elec reheat on a loop with elec and gas boilers
   scheduled via LOAD-MGMT & EQUIP-CTRL. Various things can be tried
   with AHU fans and SAT control during this period.
*  Something similar but with virtual baseboards manually sized for each
   zone, and creating a virtual gas boiler on a virtual baseboard loop,
   only enabled during warmup, while the reheat loop is scheduled off.
   Again, various things can be tried with AHU fans and SAT control
   during this period.
*  Making COOL-CONTROL = RESET, and using dual reset schedules, with the
   warmup ramping from SAT from 60F @ 60F ambient to 95F @ 20F ambient,
   or whatever.

 

If this typical practice can actually be modeled as practiced, it would
be nice to have detailed examples in some documentation or somewhere on
the DOE2.com website. If this common mode on a common system can't be
modeled as practiced, one of the utilities or states that accept DOE2
simulation results for incentive calculations needs to contract the DOE2
authors to implement more robust and realistic morning warmup routines.
Variations include using the central AHU furnace and supply air for
heating during all unoccupied periods. In some cases the simulation
needs to allow a scheduled variation in THERMOSTAT-TYPE from
PROPORTIONAL to REVERSE-ACTION during warmup or unoccupied central
heating.  Does anyone know if E+ can model these sequences
realistically?

 

 

As far as the LEED/App G question; App G meant for mixed/"hybrid" heat
source systems/buildings to be compared to all gas baselines (i.e. the
electric coils would be replaced by HW coils from a gas boiler). USGBC
reviewers reinterpreted this in an EA Cr1 CIR to allow the baseline to
be a similar hybrid as the proposed. 

 

Oh yeah the gas consumption shown under pumps/aux is the default pilot
light. Set FURNACE-AUX to zero.

packaged VAV with gas heat

 

Andrew:

 

I don't know what your climatic area is, but why should ANY heating show
up at the central unit? A VAV w/reheat, in my meager experience, is
controlling the central cooling coil to 55 DegF and adjusting reheat
coils (and VAV airflows) from there. When winter shows up, your cooling
coil is REALLY backed off (or off) and the VAV still flies, with heat
added at the space (terminal) level.

 

The only purpose you may have for a central heating coil is to preheat
outside air to, say, 40 DegF. Depending on where your climate is, this
may RARELY happen?

 

Does this sound right, folks?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Appendix G Baseline HVAC system and modeling

I have two questions that have come up recently?

 

1. If the a proposed building pursuing LEED is going to use a Packaged
   VAV system with a gas furnace in the unit and electric reheat in the
   boxes, would the baseline building (according to ASHRAE Appendix G)
   fall under the Fossil/Electric Hybrid category or the Electric
   category since that is the predominant heating source? 
2. Secondly, what is the best way to model this type of system in
   eQUEST?  I have experimented with first defining a packaged VAV unit
   in the wizard with hot water coils as the heating source.  Then in
   the detailed edit mode, I changed the system ?Heat Source? to furnace
   and ?Zone Heat Source? to electric and deleted the boiler and hot
   water loop.  When I simulated this model, no natural gas usage showed
   up in the BEPS report under Space Heating, however, there was a tiny
   amount (~2% of total heating energy) that appeared in the Pumps & Aux
   category.  Can anyone explain what?s happening and/or suggest the
   best way to model this kind of system?  As a side note, from projects
   we have monitored here in Oregon, we would expect to see about 30% of
   the total heating energy use go to natural gas for this type of
   system, primarily from morning warm-up. 

 

Thanks for your input.

As for the chiller running year round - the default operating mode is
standby - that should be changed to either demand or snap on OAT -
otherwise your chiller runs whenever a system is running "just in
case" it needs cooling.

Dear all:

 

Hi, I modeled a VAVs in eQUEST recently and the parameters related are
summarized below:

 

 100% outside air for all the year

 for preheat coil, PREHEAT-T=48.2 F ;

 for central cool coil, COOL-SET-T=48.2 F and MIN-SUPPLY-T=60.8F;

 for chilled water loop, loop operation = demand only.

 no economizer and heat recovery.NO humidity control!

 

As in Shanghai, China, there are many hours when outside air dry bulb
temp will go below 48.2F, So I think no cooling from chiller is
needed.After simulation, I exmained hourly 

 

results report and found out the CHW loop ran all the year and TEMP of
air leaving cool coil is 46F. As no humidity control, in my opinion,
there is no need to lower coil temp.

 

Why are temps of air leaving cool coil driven below 46 F while no
cooling is needed?

 

Thanks&regards

Steve,

A great DOE2.2 feature would be the ability to create boilers and chillers
that could be put into the library.  That way you can recall specific
combinations of keywords without having to recreate from scratch.

A few more comments regarding boilers:

We based the default curve for atmospheric boilers on information received
from a Northern California manufacturer?s representative. The default
atmospheric boiler consumes 45% fuel at 40% part load, so efficiency does
deteriorate. At full load, the efficiency is 80%; calculated as (PLR=1.) /
(HIR=1.25).  At 40% load, the default curve yields an efficiency of 71%;
calculated as (PLR=0.40) / (HIR=1.25 * HIRfPLR=0.45). 

We believe that a 71% efficiency at 40% load is reasonable for a modern
atmospheric boiler. The default was based on a packaged water-tube boiler
with internal convective recirculation, but performance for other types is
expected to be similar. 

The default atmospheric boiler unloads to 40% part-load ratio, and then
starts to cycle on/off; the HIRfPLR curve is valid only for part-load ratios
above 40%. The loss during the off-cycle is characterized by the ?standby
time?, which is the equivalent full-load time in hours required to keep the
boiler hot, if the boiler has no load at all. The default is 0.027 hours,
meaning that, at no load, the boiler would have to run about 2 minutes/hour
at full load to offset the jacket and flue losses. The documentation
describes the use of the standby-time vs. the part-load curve in further
detail. At very low loads, efficiency is seriously degraded; by definition
the efficiency at 0% load is 0%. You can observe this if you set up an
hourly report for the boiler and observe it at very low loads. 

Our experience to date is that manufacturer?s part-load data for boiler
performance is quite difficult to obtain. If any of you have well-documented
data that deviates significantly from the defaults, we would appreciate
hearing from you. As eQUEST/DOE-2 supports a library of equipment, it would
be possible to add performance data for various types of boilers to the
library.


For chillers, let me further clarify Kevin's comment regarding the
EIRf(PLR,dT) curve. As Kevin explained, the dT term need be developed only
for variable-speed centrifugal chillers; it is of quite limited value for
constant-speed centrifugals, and of extremely limited value for
positive-displacement machines. 

The discharge/suction temperature differential is closely associated with
the discharge/suction pressure differential. If the cooling tower is
controlled to a fixed, high setpoint such as 85F, then the chiller impeller
may not be able to slow down much at all, even at low loads; the majority of
capacity modulation will then be via the inlet vanes rather than speed. This
is because the maximum possible pressure rise across the impeller drops off
as the square of the impeller speed. Chiller impellers are typically closely
matched to the design pressure rise specified by the engineer. If the
required pressure rise does not drop off substantially as the load drops,
then the impeller must maintain speed to avoid surge.

Data commonly published by manufacturers (and implicit in the IPLV) ASSUMES
the condensing temperature drops with load; thereby allowing the impeller
speed to drop off. That may not actually be the case in real life! Nor is it
true in eQUEST unless you specify a low tower setpoint, or utilize a tower
reset scheme. 

The default EIRf(PLR,dT) curve for variable-speed centrifugals was developed
using a manufacturer's proprietary software package that was loaned to us;
it password-expired after a short time. To our knowledge, these data cannot
be developed from software available to the general engineering community.
(You need to be able to vary the chilled-water and condensing temperatures
independently of the part-load ratio. This is also why IPLV data is
worthless for an hourly simulation program; the "condenser relief" is built
into the part-load performance.) Let me know if you are aware of any
centrifugal chiller manufacturers that make this data generally available.

This brings to mind another interesting point that perhaps others can
respond to. Over the years I have heard unsubstantiated rumors that a
multi-impeller chiller, such as a Trane, may have significantly different
part-load performance compared to a single-impeller chiller, such as a
Carrier. Does anybody have information regarding multi-impeller vs.
single-impeller part-load performance?

You are too generous Mike. I should heed my own advice on the documentation.
Thanks for clarifying this.

I also thought and consulted a colleague (thanks Steve) on Taylor's chiller
question:

For chillers, the second term in EIRf(PLR,dT) is important only for
variable-speed centrifugal chillers. It is of negligible importance in other
types of chillers. It is important in variable-speed, because the
temperature differential is strongly correlated with the required speed of
the impeller. If the dT is high enough, then the impeller may have to run at
full speed even at low loads. The DOE-2 default curves are just that,
defaults. Some folks find it necessary to create new curves to reflect their
specific equipment. Cautions offered
* verify the conditions (condenser/evaprator) for efficiencies at lower part
loads are the same as for above 50%
* make sure the points are normalized around the rating condition

Sorry for my hasty response.

Steven---

 

Regarding the last question you posed in your e-mail, this is a response I received from our local Trane representative on their chiller design with multiple impellers.

 

Andrew,

 

Unloading:

Trane multistage design allows us to unload lower (without surge happening).

This is especially true if you do not have low temp condenser water available at low loads.

Trane still has an unloading advantage with the multistage, but, it has gone down a bit with the addition of VFD options to other's chillers.

Add VFDs to our multi-stage design, & we have even better unloading characteristics.

 

Part Load Efficiency:

Same is true of part load efficiency.  Multistage/economizer has the effect of having multiple sized compressors better optimized for the part load than say a single compressor sized for full load.

Trane has a part load efficiency advantage due to the multistage/economizer design, but, it has gone down a bit with the addition of VFD options to other's chillers.

Add VFDs to our multi-stage design, & we have even better part load efficiency.

Often, Trane's multistage design will have a better part load efficiency with a starter than it's competition with a VFD. 

 

Full Load & VFDs:

Only thing to remember about VFDs is that you do take a electric resistance/heat loss.

So, same chillers, one with starter & one with VFD, will result in the starter chiller having better efficiency close & up to full load, but, the VFD chiller having better efficiency at part load.

So, if you have a bunch of chillers, you may want to have one as the ramping chiller with the VFD and the others with simply starters as they will basically run close to full load.

 

Please contact me with any questions or concerns.

Thank You, 

Steve Welch

A few more comments regarding boilers:

 

We based the default curve for atmospheric boilers on information received

from a Northern California manufacturer's representative. The default

atmospheric boiler consumes 45% fuel at 40% part load, so efficiency does

deteriorate. At full load, the efficiency is 80%; calculated as (PLR=1.) /

(HIR=1.25).  At 40% load, the default curve yields an efficiency of 71%;

calculated as (PLR=0.40) / (HIR=1.25 * HIRfPLR=0.45). 

 

We believe that a 71% efficiency at 40% load is reasonable for a modern

atmospheric boiler. The default was based on a packaged water-tube boiler

with internal convective recirculation, but performance for other types is

expected to be similar. 

 

The default atmospheric boiler unloads to 40% part-load ratio, and then

starts to cycle on/off; the HIRfPLR curve is valid only for part-load ratios

above 40%. The loss during the off-cycle is characterized by the "standby

time", which is the equivalent full-load time in hours required to keep the

boiler hot, if the boiler has no load at all. The default is 0.027 hours,

meaning that, at no load, the boiler would have to run about 2 minutes/hour

at full load to offset the jacket and flue losses. The documentation

describes the use of the standby-time vs. the part-load curve in further

detail. At very low loads, efficiency is seriously degraded; by definition

the efficiency at 0% load is 0%. You can observe this if you set up an

hourly report for the boiler and observe it at very low loads. 

 

Our experience to date is that manufacturer's part-load data for boiler

performance is quite difficult to obtain. If any of you have well-documented

data that deviates significantly from the defaults, we would appreciate

hearing from you. As eQUEST/DOE-2 supports a library of equipment, it would

be possible to add performance data for various types of boilers to the

library.

 

 

For chillers, let me further clarify Kevin's comment regarding the

EIRf(PLR,dT) curve. As Kevin explained, the dT term need be developed only

for variable-speed centrifugal chillers; it is of quite limited value for

constant-speed centrifugals, and of extremely limited value for

positive-displacement machines. 

 

The discharge/suction temperature differential is closely associated with

the discharge/suction pressure differential. If the cooling tower is

controlled to a fixed, high setpoint such as 85F, then the chiller impeller

may not be able to slow down much at all, even at low loads; the majority of

capacity modulation will then be via the inlet vanes rather than speed. This

is because the maximum possible pressure rise across the impeller drops off

as the square of the impeller speed. Chiller impellers are typically closely

matched to the design pressure rise specified by the engineer. If the

required pressure rise does not drop off substantially as the load drops,

then the impeller must maintain speed to avoid surge.

 

Data commonly published by manufacturers (and implicit in the IPLV) ASSUMES

the condensing temperature drops with load; thereby allowing the impeller

speed to drop off. That may not actually be the case in real life! Nor is it

true in eQUEST unless you specify a low tower setpoint, or utilize a tower

reset scheme. 

 

The default EIRf(PLR,dT) curve for variable-speed centrifugals was developed

using a manufacturer's proprietary software package that was loaned to us;

it password-expired after a short time. To our knowledge, these data cannot

be developed from software available to the general engineering community.

(You need to be able to vary the chilled-water and condensing temperatures

independently of the part-load ratio. This is also why IPLV data is

worthless for an hourly simulation program; the "condenser relief" is built

into the part-load performance.) Let me know if you are aware of any

centrifugal chiller manufacturers that make this data generally available.

 

This brings to mind another interesting point that perhaps others can

respond to. Over the years I have heard unsubstantiated rumors that a

multi-impeller chiller, such as a Trane, may have significantly different

part-load performance compared to a single-impeller chiller, such as a

Carrier. Does anybody have information regarding multi-impeller vs.

single-impeller part-load performance?

You are too generous Mike. I should heed my own advice on the 

documentation. Thanks for clarifying this.

 

I also thought and consulted a colleague (thanks Steve) on Taylor's 

chiller question:

 

For chillers, the second term in EIRf(PLR,dT) is important only for 

variable-speed centrifugal chillers. It is of negligible importance in 

other types of chillers. It is important in variable-speed, because the 

temperature differential is strongly correlated with the required speed 

of the impeller. If the dT is high enough, then the impeller may have to 

run at full speed even at low loads. The DOE-2 default curves are just 

that, defaults. Some folks find it necessary to create new curves to 

reflect their specific equipment. Cautions offered

* verify the conditions (condenser/evaprator) for efficiencies at lower 

part loads are the same as for above 50%

* make sure the points are normalized around the rating condition

 

Sorry for my hasty response.

Thank you all for your responses and your time. My primary error was
simple... not including the PLR factor itself within the curve. Your
comments greatly increased my understanding of how the chiller and
boiler plant are modeled - I'm glad that I made the error so I could
learn so much. I will now pay close attention to the condenser loop
reset strategy when modeling a chiller VSD (for example).

describes the use of the standby-time vs. the part-load curve in further
detail. At very low loads, efficiency is seriously degraded; by definition
the efficiency at 0% load is 0%. You can observe this if you set up an
hourly report for the boiler and observe it at very low loads. 

Our experience to date is that manufacturer?s part-load data for boiler
performance is quite difficult to obtain. If any of you have well-documented
data that deviates significantly from the defaults, we would appreciate
hearing from you. As eQUEST/DOE-2 supports a library of equipment, it would
be possible to add performance data for various types of boilers to the
library.


For chillers, let me further clarify Kevin's comment regarding the
EIRf(PLR,dT) curve. As Kevin explained, the dT term need be developed only
for variable-speed centrifugal chillers; it is of quite limited value for
constant-speed centrifugals, and of extremely limited value for
positive-displacement machines. 

The discharge/suction temperature differential is closely associated with
the discharge/suction pressure differential. If the cooling tower is
controlled to a fixed, high setpoint such as 85F, then the chiller impeller
may not be able to slow down much at all, even at low loads; the majority of
capacity modulation will then be via the inlet vanes rather than speed. This
is because the maximum possible pressure rise across the impeller drops off
as the square of the impeller speed. Chiller impellers are typically closely
matched to the design pressure rise specified by the engineer. If the
required pressure rise does not drop off substantially as the load drops,
then the impeller must maintain speed to avoid surge.

Data commonly published by manufacturers (and implicit in the IPLV) ASSUMES
the condensing temperature drops with load; thereby allowing the impeller
speed to drop off. That may not actually be the case in real life! Nor is it
true in eQUEST unless you specify a low tower setpoint, or utilize a tower
reset scheme. 

The default EIRf(PLR,dT) curve for variable-speed centrifugals was developed
using a manufacturer's proprietary software package that was loaned to us;
it password-expired after a short time. To our knowledge, these data cannot
be developed from software available to the general engineering community.
(You need to be able to vary the chilled-water and condensing temperatures
independently of the part-load ratio. This is also why IPLV data is
worthless for an hourly simulation program; the "condenser relief" is built
into the part-load performance.) Let me know if you are aware of any
centrifugal chiller manufacturers that make this data generally available.

This brings to mind another interesting point that perhaps others can
respond to. Over the years I have heard unsubstantiated rumors that a
multi-impeller chiller, such as a Trane, may have significantly different
part-load performance compared to a single-impeller chiller, such as a
Carrier. Does anybody have information regarding multi-impeller vs.
single-impeller part-load performance?

You are too generous Mike. I should heed my own advice on the 
documentation. Thanks for clarifying this.

I also thought and consulted a colleague (thanks Steve) on Taylor's 
chiller question:

For chillers, the second term in EIRf(PLR,dT) is important only for 
variable-speed centrifugal chillers. It is of negligible importance in 
other types of chillers. It is important in variable-speed, because the 
temperature differential is strongly correlated with the required speed 
of the impeller. If the dT is high enough, then the impeller may have to 
run at full speed even at low loads. The DOE-2 default curves are just 
that, defaults. Some folks find it necessary to create new curves to 
reflect their specific equipment. Cautions offered
* verify the conditions (condenser/evaprator) for efficiencies at lower 
part loads are the same as for above 50%
* make sure the points are normalized around the rating condition

Sorry for my hasty response.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE2 - Modeling Radiant H&C and DOAS with Cooling Boost
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710051245.AA4541218pd80003841383@gard.com>

I'm working on a university building project which is made up of
office and classroom space. The HVAC system is designed with 4 pipe
radiant heating and cooling ceiling panels and a dedicated outside air
(DOA) ventilation fan, i.e. at 8,500 cfm. The DOA air is relieved out
the building and not returned. The DOA system is variable volume because
terminal units (no reheat) are used to shut off the room ventilation air
if the light occupancy sensor doesn't detect activity in the room. The
normal DOA SAT is 70F, which is neutral to room temperature setpoint.
This description is all pretty standard stuff, well here is the twist.
The DOA system has been up sized to carry some of the summer cooling
load, i.e. 12,000 cfm. The DOA cooling coil has also been sized to reset
the SAT down to 52F if the building average temperature is over 76F
(adjustable). This setting will probable get driven lower once the O&M
staff take over the building, i.e 72-74F. The local thermostat modulates
the terminal unit airflow from the minimum ventilation setting to the
maximum "cooling boost" setting. 

So the question is, what is the best DOE2 system choice to model the
radiant heating/cooling ceiling panels and DOA as described above? The
energy analyst has started with FC units with fan energy set to zero and
using ventilation command OS-FROM-SYSTEM. Ventilation air is assigned
from a VAV system with 100% OSA. What are other people typically using
to model this system? Which DOE2 system choice or technique would best
capture the "cooling boost" energy penalty? I'm also concerned
that potential radiant reheat energy will not be captured when the DOA
is switched into the "cooling boost" mode and there is no cooling
demand in some of the zones, i.e. zones located in the basement. Any
thoughts?

Actually Kevin didn't get the boiler hourly energy equation quite right.
The actual equation is:
 
Hourly Boiler Energy = DesignCapacity * HIR * HIRf(plr)

The part of this that Kevin didn't explain is that the boiler HIRf(PLR)
curve includes the PLR which explains why the curve is nearly linear.  The
value that the performance curve returns is actually  
 
(HIRadj) * PLR
 
HIRadj  =  the multiplier that indicates how the full load HIR changes with
respect to part load.   If the boiler efficiency at a given part load goes
down, HIRadj > 1.  If the boiler efficiency goes up at a given part load
HIRadj<1.  HIRadj is really the ratio HIR-partload over HIR-fullload. 
 
PLR = hourly load on the boiler / total capacity of the boiler
 
To create a curve that describes boiler HIR at various part loads you will
need to divide the performance curve output at each part load point by the
part load value and then multiply by the full load HIR.
 
Taylor - You should double check your "custom" chiller curves I'm pretty
sure from what you describe they are not correct.  The Vol6 -New Features
user manual does a good job describing how the chiller curves work.  I
suggest you review this.  You can use the Excel function "LINEST" to create
the necessary coefficients for a bi-quadratic curve from manufacturers
chiller data.  Typically you will need to request data for a specific
chiller from the chiller rep.  The hardest data to get is the chiller
capacity data at various CHW/CW temperatures.  Remember total chiller
capacity is different than the rated 100% part load point, most chillers can
provide 10-20% extra capacity.  
 
I have had good experience creating custom chiller curves for DOE2.2 and I
think the default curves in eQuest are representative of the various chiller
types.  Obviously if you are evaluating a specific chiller you should try to
create custom curves.

Perhaps it would help to clarify how DOE-2.2 (the simulation engine behind
eQUEST) calculates hourly energy input for boilers and chillers.

For boilers, the hourly energy input is:
  Hourly Energy = Cap(hour) * HIR * HIRf(plr)

So while the HIRf(plr) may increase as part load decreases, which is not
uncommon for standard atmospheric boilers, the energy use will certainly
decrease with plr because the required output of the boiler for the hour
decreases.

For chillers, DOE-2 uses the following relationship to calculate the
electricity input to the chiller each hour:

  Caphour  = Capacity * CAPf(t1,t2)
  PLR      = Load / Caphour
  dT       = t2 ? t1
  Elechour = Caphour * EIR * EIRf(t1,t2) * EIRf(PLR,dT) / 3413 Btu/kW

where

  Caphour      hourly capacity, Btuh (this is dependent on condenser and
evaporator conditions for that hour)
  Capacity     rated capacity, Btuh
  CAPf(t1,t2)  correction to capacity for temperatures, curve CAP-FT
  t1           leaving chilled-water temperature, ?F
  t2           condenser temperature, ?F
  PLR          Part load ratio
  Load         Hourly load, Btuh
  dT           Temperature differential across chiller, ?F
  Elechour     electric input to the chiller, kW
  EIR          rated electric input ratio
  EIRf(t1,t2)  correction to EIR for temperatures, curve EIR-FT

Again, the primary factor affecting chiller energy use is the cooling
capacity needed for that hour. Just because you don't have access to the
dual function information doesn't mean you shouldn't be accounting for it in
the simulation. Chiller performance is dependent on all operating conditions
including load, condenser conditions and evaporator conditions.

For a more complete discussion on these simulation concepts, refer to the
DOE-2 documentation included with the eQUEST installation. Look in
Dictionary:HVAC Components:Boiler:Boiler Energy Consumption and

(atmospheric boilers become somewhat less efficient at part load). The
default atmospheric boiler curve decreases almost linearly down to zero! I
am having a tough time wrapping my head around this.

On the chiller side, the default f(PLR) is a bi-quadratic function using
both dT and PLR as variables, so it is f(PLR,dT). Since I never have this
dual function information in my general chiller selections, I have been
using a standard f(PLR) function quoted at a fixed dT from the manufacturer.
The curve I get from a McQuay 400-ton chiller selection is quadratic, with
decreasing EIR down to 50% load and increasing EIR below 50% load. I
seriously doubt that the eQuest default corresponds with this entry because
changing the function produces a huge change in performance.

Do any of you have any thoughts or suggestions about the accuracy of default
f(PLR) curves? Should I scrap my "improved," real curves - they are
drastically changing the model performance?!?!

Dear all,
I constructed an eQUEST model recently and I didn't set average space temperature first,leaving it to 

default value.  I also set my own customized average space temperature for the same model.To my 

suprise, The annual electic and gas consumption for these two models are a little bit different with each 

other! In my opinion, once the heat gain and loss are the same for this two models, their energy 

consumption should be the equal! Why are there some difference in energy consumption for these two models?

Your answers are greatly appreciately!

Regards&thanks!

Perhaps it would help to clarify how DOE-2.2 (the simulation engine 
behind eQUEST) calculates hourly energy input for boilers and chillers.

For boilers, the hourly energy input is:
  Hourly Energy = Cap(hour) * HIR * HIRf(plr)

So while the HIRf(plr) may increase as part load decreases, which is not 
uncommon for standard atmospheric boilers, the energy use will certainly 
decrease with plr because the required output of the boiler for the hour 
decreases.

For chillers, DOE-2 uses the following relationship to calculate the 
electricity input to the chiller each hour:

  Caphour  = Capacity * CAPf(t1,t2)
  PLR      = Load / Caphour
  dT       = t2 -- t1
  Elechour = Caphour * EIR * EIRf(t1,t2) * EIRf(PLR,dT) / 3413 Btu/kW

where

  Caphour      hourly capacity, Btuh (this is dependent on condenser and 
evaporator conditions for that hour)
  Capacity     rated capacity, Btuh
  CAPf(t1,t2)  correction to capacity for temperatures, curve CAP-FT
  t1           leaving chilled-water temperature, ?F
  t2           condenser temperature, ?F

  dT           Temperature differential across chiller, ?F

  EIR          rated electric input ratio
  EIRf(t1,t2)  correction to EIR for temperatures, curve EIR-FT
  EIRf(PLR,dT) correction to EIR for part-load ratio and dT, curve EIR-FPLR

Again, the primary factor affecting chiller energy use is the cooling 
capacity needed for that hour. Just because you don't have access to the

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710041742.AA4207343pd80003834492@gard.com>

Dear Bldg-Sim Members,

 

The Brendle Group, a Fort Collins, Colorado-based engineering consulting
firm, is seeking project descriptions/case studies to highlight in a new
"Wiki" site being sponsored by the Colorado Governor's Energy Office.   The
Building Professionals Energy Resource will be launched later this fall and
will be an extensive inventory of technologies, projects and processes to
serve as a comprehensive energy-related resource for Colorado building
professionals. 

 

Along with information on a wide range of technologies/strategies (lighting,
HVAC, building envelope, renewables, etc.) and processes (commissioning,
integrated design, modeling, etc.), the website will include case studies of
Colorado commercial and residential projects.  We are seeking input on a
potential Colorado case study relating to commercial building energy
modeling.  We are specifically looking for existing web pages, other written
material, narrative information by email, graphics and photos-any
documentation from which a case study can be built. This will be a good
opportunity to share the success of your project with the larger building
community in Colorado.

 

If members have any suggestions for a Colorado-based commercial energy
modeling case study, please direct your input to dwortman at brendlegroup.com.

I am a bit confused between the Energy Cost Budget Method and 
Appendix G.  For the LEED C&S it seems that all non-regulated energy 
loads are included in the performance calculation.  Is this the 
correct interpretation?  With the process loads at 25% of the total

Andrew:
 
I don't know what your climatic area is, but why should ANY heating show
up at the central unit? A VAV w/reheat, in my meager experience, is
controlling the central cooling coil to 55 DegF and adjusting reheat
coils (and VAV airflows) from there. When winter shows up, your cooling
coil is REALLY backed off (or off) and the VAV still flies, with heat
added at the space (terminal) level.
 
The only purpose you may have for a central heating coil is to preheat
outside air to, say, 40 DegF. Depending on where your climate is, this
may RARELY happen?
 
Does this sound right, folks?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Appendix G Baseline HVAC system and modeling

I have two questions that have come up recently...

 

1.	If the a proposed building pursuing LEED is going to use a
Packaged VAV system with a gas furnace in the unit and electric reheat
in the boxes, would the baseline building (according to ASHRAE Appendix
G) fall under the Fossil/Electric Hybrid category or the Electric
category since that is the predominant heating source? 
2.	Secondly, what is the best way to model this type of system in
eQUEST?  I have experimented with first defining a packaged VAV unit in
the wizard with hot water coils as the heating source.  Then in the
detailed edit mode, I changed the system "Heat Source" to furnace and
"Zone Heat Source" to electric and deleted the boiler and hot water
loop.  When I simulated this model, no natural gas usage showed up in
the BEPS report under Space Heating, however, there was a tiny amount
(~2% of total heating energy) that appeared in the Pumps & Aux category.
Can anyone explain what's happening and/or suggest the best way to model
this kind of system?  As a side note, from projects we have monitored
here in Oregon, we would expect to see about 30% of the total heating
energy use go to natural gas for this type of system, primarily from
morning warm-up. 

 

Thanks for your input.

Your temperature control drawings/specs may have some information on
those values.

 

If you've relaxed the defaults you should verify in the SS-O reports
that your temperatures are staying in a reasonable range.

 

Although changing the throttling range may have reduced the unmet hours
in the simulation there may have been some other causes for the unmet
hours in the zone.  (Airflows or zone heating capacities that could be
adjusted?)

In the detailed edit mode, try clicking on "Check Building Description"
in the Tools pull-down menu.  This usually will give you a description
of the BDL error that is in your building and helps troubleshoot it.
Good luck.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Equest Space Error

 

I initially created my building with the DD Wizard and have gone on to
revise the generated building in the detailed interface. I am getting an
error message that I am unable to solve. It reads under the "Space"
folder "<unknown/invalid component name>" and the next to the error icon
reads "Ceiling Space was referenced on line 28161 but neve..." I am
unable to read the full error message and when I click on the error it
just says "Invalid command and/or reference table indices." 

 

I have a hunch as to the room that the error is referencing because
there was previously another error with the ceiling area which I have
resolved. Any ideas on what could be the problem?

I noticed when I ramp up the thermostat throttling range, the number of
unmet hours goes down for the whole building.  Is there a standard or
requirement for this number when modeling for LEED?

Josh,

We just finished a new first-principles model of exactly that construction
for a client here in Madison.  It's TRNSYS-based and accounts for the
following items (assuming 1-D air flow through the wall cavity):

solar absorbed on the outer surface
convection off the outer surface
long-wave radiation exchange with the sky (outer surface)
conduction through the outer material (brick, terra cotta etc.)
energy storage in the massive outer material
convective/radiative exchange in the air gap (natural and forced convection)
heat transfer through the multi-layer inside wall

I'm not sure what modeling package you're currently using but thought you
might be interested...

If you want to use Material:Air, then you can get thermal resistance values for various air gap configurations from ASHRAE Handbook of fundamentals, in HoF 2001 its Table 3 in Chapt 25.  But these are for sealed cavities, not ventilated.   

 

For an opaque exterior ventilated cavity, there is also a special model in EnergyPlus - see the Surface:HeatTransfer:ExteriorNaturalVentedCavity object.  But that model isn't really intended for such a thick, heavy outer veneer.

There is not currently a predefined ASHRAE 90.1 compliance checker
within the eQUEST software (or any other software that I am aware of).
I have heard rumours that one is in development for eQUEST (which
would be great).

 

Right now, you create a model of your building using the modelling
software.  Then modify a copy of the model as defined in ASHRAE 90.1
to define the reference model - i.e. change the lighting power
density, the envelope U-values, mechanical system type, capacities and
efficiencies.  Note the requirement for glazing and reference building
rotation (there has been considerable discussion of both on this list
- check the archive).

 

Hope this helps.

Jonathan,
 
You need to put the 100% OA in the baseline building if it is lab or a
hospital. App. G spells it out distinctly, just read the section about air
changes. The preheat coils must be the same in the proposed design and the
baseline building as in G3.1.2.3.

All,
 
I was looking for some help on interpreting how a baseline 90.1 Appendix G
building should be modeled if the proposed building uses a dedicated outside
air unit.
 
My interpretation is that the baseline building should be modeled without
the 100% outside air unit (and per Table G3.1.1B), but in this case could
you add preheat coils to the baseline simulation main air handling units, if
not in the proposed? 

G3.1.2.3 Preheat Coils. If the HVAC system in the proposed

design has a preheat coil and a preheat coil can be modeled

in the baseline system, the baseline system shall be

modeled with a preheat coil controlled in the same manner as

the proposed design.

Thanks,

Ryan,
 
Equest cannot do the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 App. G compliance automatically. My
advice to you is to create a copy of your design building and use this copy
to model a baseline building separately. You won't have the nice generic
graphs at the end.

Hi, Jeremy,
   
  I would suggest you to simulate radiant cooling in eQUEST by using fan-coil system. You need to remove the fan energy use in the fan coil unit. Additional make-up system is needed for ventilation. The pump head needed to be adjust to mimic the pump energy use increase in radiant cooling.

        st1\:*{behavior:url(#default#ieooui) }                Hello everyone,
   
  I??m attempting to model radiant cooling with eQuest 3-6. You cannot actually model it in eQuest (to my knowledge) so I??m trying to ??trick?? the program. 
   
  First, I??m simulating a VAV system with a chilled water loop for cooling and then obtain the cooling load on the chiller. Second, I simulate a VAV system with only outside air ventilation to meet code. There are exhaust fans in each room to replace the return fan which I removed. From the second simulation I obtain the cooling load on the chiller which is from the cooling of the outside air. Third, I subtract the first model??s chiller cooling load by the second model??s chiller cooling load to obtain what would be the cooling load taken up by radiant ceiling cooling panels. 
   
  In theory, the radiant cooling panels?? load would be much larger than the outside air cooling load. However, my calculations are telling me that the outdoor air load is larger than the radiant cooling panels?? load. Also, in the second simulation, I have reduced the amount of supply air by 80% because only outdoor air is being supplied to the building. Therefore, my fan power consumption should decrease by 80% as well. My results tell me however that the fans?? energy consumption has only decreased by 10%.
   
  Would anyone know of a reason why my results don??t make any sense?? The majority of my inputs for the two simulations are the same except for where it is necessary to vary them. 
   
  Thanks,

Hello,

Does anyone know how to use equest as a tool to provide documentation for
compliance with ASHRAE 90.1-2004?  There are a number of California
standards and codes that I can check compliance with that are already within
the software.  How can I add 90.1-2004 to the list?

 

Does anyone have any experience with this?  I am working on EA credit 1 for
LEED.

 

Thanks,

Hello everyone,

 

I'm attempting to model radiant cooling with eQuest 3-6. You cannot
actually model it in eQuest (to my knowledge) so I'm trying to "trick"

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710011340.AA4035609pd80003810698@gard.com>

All,
 
I was looking for some help on interpreting how a baseline 90.1 Appendix
G building should be modeled if the proposed building uses a dedicated
outside air unit.
 
My interpretation is that the baseline building should be modeled
without the 100% outside air unit (and per Table G3.1.1B), but in this
case could you add preheat coils to the baseline simulation main air
handling units, if not in the proposed? 

G3.1.2.3 Preheat Coils. If the HVAC system in the proposed

design has a preheat coil and a preheat coil can be modeled

in the baseline system, the baseline system shall be

modeled with a preheat coil controlled in the same manner as

the proposed design.

Thanks,

Jonathan Curtin

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] property values and solar energy

Anyone have information on property value increases for including/adding
solar energy (photovoltaics, and or hot water) to residential and/or
commercial buildings.

 

There is a reference out there to the Appraisal Journal saying 1$
reduction in utility bills equals $20 in increased property values.  But
this is for conventional conservation improvements for residential.
Does it apply to solar energy generation?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200710011113.AA1333468pd80003808420@gard.com>

I am modeling a VAV system for a LEED Project per Appendix G.  There are
several control requirements for the boiler, chiller and air distribution
system that I am having trouble implementing in Trace:

Per ASHRAE 90.1 2004 Appendix G G3.1.3.3: Specifying the boiler supply and
return temperatures

Per ASHRAE 90.1 2004 Appendix G G3.1.3.4: Boiler supply temperature reset
based on OA temperature

Per ASHRAE 90.1 2004 Appendix G G3.1.3.8: Specifiying the chiller supply and
return temperatures

Per ASHRAE 90.1 2004 Appendix G G3.1.3.9: Chilled water supply temperature
reset based on OA temperature

Per ASHRAE 90.1 2004 Appendix G G3.1.3.12: Supply air temperature reset
based on zone demand


Anyone have luck implementing these control strategies in Trane Trace?

Thanks,
-Jon

In a project in which a new construction building is being built into the
side of a hill, I encounter several spaces that will require both Exterior
Wall Construction and Underground Wall Construction.  I am curious how it
will effect the building simulation if an exterior and underground wall were
both modeled on the same vertex point of a space.  Is this recognized?
Does this result in accurate simulation?  Should I just create an extra
vertex point to make one half be exterior and the other half underground?

 

I was forwarded this article "UNDERGROUND SURFACES: HOW TO GET A BETTER
UNDERGROUND SURFACE HEAT TRANSFER CALCULATION IN DOE-2.1E"

by Fred Winkelmann,   http://gundog.lbl.gov/dirun/23n_d_1.pdf .  I don't
know if this is the same situation or not.  If I find an effective U-value
between the two constructions am I to yield more accurate results?

 

Any help would be most appreciated.
