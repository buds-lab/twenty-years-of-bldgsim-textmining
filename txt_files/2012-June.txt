Subject: [Bldg-sim] Window and Occupancy Sensor Interlocks to Suspend HVAC
	System
Message-ID: <CAJDkqJfcfOEfVUwMxf7G-QYp9a2H1jLsVUDRfU2hD1=8VLL5Qg@mail.gmail.com>

I am working on an eQUEST energy model and am curious if it is possible to
model VAV boxes that are interlocked with occupancy sensors that will shut
down the fans when the spaces are not occupied. Has anybody had any success
submitting an exceptional calculation for this method to LEED, or come
across any pertinent CIRs?

I have been using Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: N  3?  7' E 101? 33'
vs.  Jakarta at 6 S, 107 E.

The suitability of this file would depend on the 
requirements of your analysis.

Hello All,

I'm attempting to model the savings from increasing the size of a plate and frame heat exchanger in eQUEST. I've found, however, that no matter what I enter as a value for capacity, eQUEST seems to override this and just operate the PFHX whenever outdoor air wet bulb permits, making the plate and frame capacity equal to the maximum loop load whenever the wet bulb temp is below 37 F (depending on approach temps, CHW supply temp, etc). I've tried entering capacities as low as 0.00001 MBtu/h and have also tried allowing it to autosize capacity and then using a capacity ratio less than one to compensate. Neither achieves the desired outcome.

Has anyone run into this issue before?

Thank you very much,
Joe

Subject: [Bldg-sim] EnergyPlus V7.1 Released
Message-ID: <20120604222511.D0D1A8DB162A@zapata.dreamhost.com>

EnergyPlus Version 7.1 and OpenStudio Legacy Plug-in 1.0.8 Available

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has released an updated version 
of EnergyPlus simulation software for modeling heating, cooling, 
lighting, ventilating, and other building energy flows. Additionally, 
a new version of OpenStudio Plug-in for Google SketchUp is available, 
which makes it possible to perform EnergyPlus simulations using 
Google's user-friendly 3-D drawing interface.
Visit www.energyplus.gov to learn more and download EnergyPlus and 
OpenStudio Plug-in now.

Enhancements in the New Versions

General

* EnergyPlus can now use multi-core processors to speed execution of 
models with large geometry descriptions. The solution for inside face 
surface temperatures was threaded using OpenMP technology.
* The Design Day object was restructured and allows finer control 
over humidity conditions.
* The Run Period object was extended to include features useful for 
real-time and real-weather simulations.

Datasets

* New equipment performance data set for 110 different air-cooled 
chillers - see the file AirCooledChiller.idf

Input

* Corrected or clarified the units for various input fields

Zone and Surface Models

* Many new output variables were added to expand the reporting 
available for surface heat transfer model results.
* The modeling of internal gains was revised and improved to 
facilitate integrating HVAC equipment skin losses and the zone 
thermal model. Losses from plant pumps can now be added to thermal zones.

Natural and Mechanical Ventilation

* New comprehensive modeling of the concentration of a generic 
gaseous contaminant in zone air including internal emission sources 
and ventilation controls.
* Added system-level zone maximum outdoor air fraction for 
ventilation rate procedure for sizing and annual calculations.
* Added support for multi-path air distribution systems in the 
ventilation rate procedure based on the ASHRAE Standard 62.1 for 
annual calculations.
* Added Demand Controlled Ventilation for sizing calculations based 
on ASHRAE Standard 62.1 for both single- and multi-path systems.

HVAC and Refrigeration

* Commercial refrigeration models were expanded to include systems 
that use transcritical CO2.
* A new coil system was added for modeling air-to-air heat pump coils 
in built-up air handlers, outdoor air systems, and zone outdoor air units.
* Fan-powered induction air terminal units can now draw secondary air 
from plenums.
* Added autosizing for hot water baseboards in HVACTemplates.
* Added pumping options, piping configurations, fluid types, and 
additional controls to HVACTemplate plant loops.
* Added additional control and part load ratio inputs to 
HVACTemplate:Plant:Chiller and HVACTemplate:Plant:Boiler.
* Added additional error checking to HVACTemplate objects.
* Added model for Integral-Collector-Storage (ICS) solar collectors 
for hot water heating.
* Added the ability to use hot water (or steam) coils in various HVAC 
equipment that have options for different types of heating coils.
* The models for adding/removing heat to/from the return air stream 
were improved to add maximum and minimum limits on the temperature of 
the return air (+60C, -30C).
* The Integrated Part Load Value (IPLV) standard rating for chillers 
can now be calculated from the chiller input and reported.
* Added "High/Low Temperature Heating Standard (Net) Rating Capacity" 
and HSPF calculation routines for single speed air source heatpumps.
* Added two-stage compression with intercooling to the detailed 
commercial refrigeration cycle model.
* New model to reset condenser loop temperature setpoints using 
predetermined curves that reduce net energy consumption for the 
chiller and cooling tower plant.
* New "ideal" model to reset condenser loop temperature setpoints 
using a search algorithm to find the near-optimal setpoint at a given 
timestep which gives the minimum total chiller, cooling tower, 
chilled water pump and condenser water pump power consumption.
* The heat pump water heater model can now use a stratified thermal tank.
* Added a new model for variable speed, water-to-air heat pumps.

Controls and User Functions

* A new category of HVAC and plant components was added that allow 
using EMS's capabilities to create user-defined models of new and 
unique equipment. Users can now define their own component models 
using new IDF objects that serve as generic holders for zone 
forced-air units, coils in an air handler, zone air terminal units, 
or plant components.
* The EnergyPlus Runtime Language used for EMS programming was 
extended to include WHILE loops and to allow directly evaluating 
curve and table IDF objects from inside programs.
* New EMS Actuators were added including: surface construction, 
surface outside boundary conditions, and refrigeration system 
condenser minimum temperature limit.
* The ExternalInterface used for co-simulation was extended to allow 
using Functional Mock-up Units (FMU) including a FMU parser for 
pre-processing FMUs.

Output

* Multiple daylight illuminance maps can now be generated for a single zone.
* Energy meters have been added to output summary reports.
* A new sizing report related to ASHRAE Standard 62.1 has been added 
to output summary reports

Documentation and Guides

* Documentation has been updated for all documents.

Platforms

* Windows (XP, Vista, Windows 7) 32 and 64 bit versions
* Linux (Ubuntu 9.04 and above, Redhat 5.4 and above) 32 and 64 bit versions
* Mac (with Intel processors) (10.6, 10.7) 32 and 64 bit versions
* EnergyPlus V 7.1 has been tested on all of these platforms

And many other enhancements and speed improvements throughout. 
Suggestion: get as much memory as possible in your computer for 
running EnergyPlus.

Thanks!

Please excuse the cross-posting...and save the date!

The next IBPSA-USA meeting will be held Saturday, June 23rd, in San Antonio, TX (concurrent with the start of the ASHRAE Winter Meeting) - please plan to attend if you are in town!

A business meeting will be held from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. in Room 102B in the Convention Center adjacent to the conference hotel. No registration is required for the business meeting.

The dinner meeting will take place with social hour and registration from 6:30 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. followed by a dinner presentation until 9:00 p.m.

The location and final meeting cost are not yet finalized, although we anticipate the cost to be around $40 as with recent meetings, and the location to be walking distance from the conference hotel.

The past few meetings have been very informative concerning events in the simulation community, and provide a great opportunity to meet fellow building simulators.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the meeting or IBPSA-USA. We'll provide a additional announcements closer to the time of the meeting with the exact location, cost, and speaker details.

IBPSA-USA local chapter leaders - please forward to your membership as well.

As we did for the past meeting in Chicago, we'll have a pre-registration using Eventbright which I encourage you to use if possible.

Hi Leonard,

 

I can't claim to be an expert, but I have used TRACE for daylighting
analysis.  It has the capability to do everything you mention.  

 

It will account for a dimming or on/off algorithm for reducing the electric
lighting when appropriate (you specify target illuminance on the workplane).
You can create custom algorithms for this.  You can include internal shading
with any level of transmissivity, and you can put that shading on a
time-clock schedule.  I'm not aware of a way to put the internal shading on
a schedule based on incident sunlight or some other parameter.  You can
create custom exterior shading in the form of overhangs, fins, overhangs and
fins, or an object like a nearby building.  I don't think these can be on
any sort of schedule.  I am also not aware of a way to model daylighting
features such as exterior or interior light shelves, but you can place the
daylight sensors where ever you would like relative to the daylighting
apertures, so there is some flexibility in perhaps adjusting sensor
placement to account for light distribution.

 

I believe TRACE uses the same or similar daylighting algorithm as DOE-2.

 

I hope this helps,

Christian

Sorry for cross-posting,

Does anyone use MS Visio for sketching HVAC diagrams?
Is it a good alternative to Ms Word, which is somehow tolerable for simple
diagrams, but gets really out of hands for bigger diagrams?
The shapes, which are included in Visio, are they helpful, meaningful, give
professional look?

Somebody is using Excel (might be lacking flexibility when topology is
unknown).
Somebody is using Inkscape.
Any other thoughts
Thank you,

Pavel Dybskiy

If you are familiar with AutoCAD for drawing schematics then you will be 
able to use Draftsight from Dassault systems. It's free.

I have been using Visio for a long, long time for HVAC diagrams and schematics especially when sketching out additions to existing systems etc. It is an excellent tool for this although most of the stock templates are not to my liking so I have made my own shapes and saved those on a stencil for reuse. Nothing too ?intelligent? but with connection points and ability to quickly create schematic. I also tend to use the ductwork layout stencil to create exhaust layouts. The purpose of the drawings or sketches are for pricing assistance and not a detailed engineering drawing.

 

A CAD tool might also be a reasonable tool (at a former company we had a Visio-like AutoCAD product to do control drawings that I adapted to do some basic HVAC schematics but I came back to Visio. I found it easier but our CAD operators would beg to differ).  I have also used HVAC Solution. It is an excellent tool for creating diagrams as well as doing some calculations on the system.  They used to have a water-side only tool but they have discontinued  it. Taco, the pump manufacturer, has a similar tool (by the same developer I believe) available. Taco also has some other very interesting tools for the residential side that can be adapted for light commercial.

Sorry for cross-posting,

 

Does anyone use MS Visio for sketching HVAC diagrams? 

Is it a good alternative to Ms Word, which is somehow tolerable for simple diagrams, but gets really out of hands for bigger diagrams?

The shapes, which are included in Visio, are they helpful, meaningful, give professional look?

 

Somebody is using Excel (might be lacking flexibility when topology is unknown).

Somebody is using Inkscape.
Any other thoughts

Thank you,

 

Pavel Dybskiy

Hi Jim,

What tool do you use to draw your diagram?

 

Dear List,

I'm wondering if you can share your thoughts on your favorite tool to draft efficiently such diagrams.

Is there anything better than pencil and paper?

 

Thanks,

 

Paul

Dear Forum,

The schematic I have attached is a common boiler plant piping configuration in my experience, using an individual constant speed pump for each boiler, plus a variable speed distribution pump.

Officially it?s a ?primary ? secondary pumping loop?.

I cannot make the primary pumps shut off when the corresponding boiler is inactive.  Has anyone successfully modeled this configuration?  Do you know of an example file with this configuration?

Thanks in advance.

 

 

Making me think?.

Why is it?  We routinely use miracles of creativity and technology that 50-100 years ago would be considered impossible or black magic ? and also assume that whole segments of society are incapable of helping themselves  or acting intelligently.  Is it a self-fulfilling expectation?

I would humbly submit OpenStudio (openstudio.nrel.gov) as a tool for diagramming these systems. The OpenStudio application has a visual HVAC system design tab in the interface that has been engineered to allow idiots like me to create ASHRAE standard system types, and customize from there as needed. While the graphics may not be super sexy, they tell the story. Further, after you've dragged and dropped your way to a functional and valid HVAC system description, you not only have a series of graphics that illustrate it, you also have underlying code describing this system in OpenStudio-speak, as well as EnergyPlus-speak, ready for simulation.

Subject: [EnergyPlus_Support] Tools to draw HVAC diagrams



Hi Jim,
What tool do you use to draw your diagram?

Dear List,
I'm wondering if you can share your thoughts on your favorite tool to draft efficiently such diagrams.
Is there anything better than pencil and paper?

Thanks,

Paul

Dear Forum,
The schematic I have attached is a common boiler plant piping configuration in my experience, using an individual constant speed pump for each boiler, plus a variable speed distribution pump.
Officially it?s a ?primary ? secondary pumping loop?.
I cannot make the primary pumps shut off when the corresponding boiler is inactive.  Has anyone successfully modeled this configuration?  Do you know of an example file with this configuration?
Thanks in advance.

Why is it?  We routinely use miracles of creativity and technology that 50-100 years ago would be considered impossible or black magic ? and also assume that whole segments of society are incapable of helping themselves  or acting intelligently.  Is it a self-fulfilling expectation?

Pavel,

I like Visio for simple/moderately complex drawings on any kind including HVAC.

It is easy to put something together quickly. Also it is easy to create .pdf or paste drawings into other Microsoft products in order to share them.

However, I wouldn't use it for anything beyond concept drawings or presentation materials. I prefer Autocad or Revit for design/construction drawings. The CAD features of Visio are limited so any really detailed or accurate work should use a real CAD program.

Hope that helps.

Fred

Sorry for cross-posting,

Does anyone use MS Visio for sketching HVAC diagrams?
Is it a good alternative to Ms Word, which is somehow tolerable for simple diagrams, but gets really out of hands for bigger diagrams?
The shapes, which are included in Visio, are they helpful, meaningful, give professional look?

Somebody is using Excel (might be lacking flexibility when topology is unknown).
Somebody is using Inkscape.
Any other thoughts
Thank you,

Pavel Dybskiy

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Reminder: Short survey (simulating plug load energy use)
Message-ID: <CAGbQLLqCO0N5Y1jgpgZFEnY6qFBh_MDtojgrxvPYHd_oSo7tgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all - I wanted to re-send this announcement for those who missed it the
first time. If you have 10 minutes for this short survey, we would
appreciate it! The survey is here: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/G3GQZB8

The survey is part of a research study regarding simulated
plug/process/receptacle load use in commercial buildings. We are inviting
feedback from energy modelers regarding their assumptions for plug load
energy use. For more information about the study, please see below. Let me
know if you have any questions.

The survey will close June 29th.

Best,
Gwen Fuertes

This research project is a joint project with the Center for the Built
Environment at U.C. Berkeley and with the cooperation of the U.S. Green
Building Council. One of the goals of this project is to understand how
project teams and energy modelers are simulating the use of plug loads in
LEED energy models. To date, little research has been done to evaluate the
methods and trends of the energy modeling industry in terms of this
particular end use. Since plug loads are becoming one of the most
significant end uses in commercial buildings, understanding the simulated
and actual energy of plug/receptacle loads will help inform owners and
modelers alike on the contribution this has to the total energy use of a
new construction or major renovation project.

Typically, equipment falling into the plug/receptacle load category is out
of the scope of control of a typical whole-building design team, and there
is little information available to the team in the design stage regarding
what specific equipment will be installed. Design teams are frequently left
to estimate the annual receptacle load energy use and peak demand, using
rules of thumb or other standardized/generalized practice. Further research
is needed to determine the accuracy of these rules of thumb as compared to
actual energy use or a more itemized energy projection, and this study may
be a first step towards identifying and describing that potential
discrepancy.

This survey aims to understand how energy modelers estimate this end use.
Additional details regarding the project can be accessed here, and further
questions can be directed to gfuertes at berkeley.edu.

Thank you for your time!

Thank you all!

Now I know where should I start from

Poll reveals :)
Visio  and CAD 27 % of votes;
OpenStudio , Word, Excel, InkScape 9% each.

P.S. Surprisingly stable picture, a majority of names are older than 17
years :)

Pavel,

You might consider Diagramly.com for your HVAC diagrams. It's a Visio-like web-based program for diagrams that is capable of everything from simple flow charts up through more complicated one-line diagrams. The feature I really like is that it contains some extensive symbols libraries for things like pumps, fans, compressors, valves, etc. if you want more than just a crude block diagram. You can export to PDF or vector graphics formats if you want to fine-tune in another program.

Regards,
Peter

Hi Rob,

I have installed OpenStudio
I tried to import one of e+ example files, SolarCollectorFlatPlateWater.idf.
It looks like OpenStudio didn't recognize quite a few objects, e.g.
IddObjectType: 'WaterHeater:Mixed'
Please advise.

Pavel

Would you say that Open studio is finally "ready" for real world projects?
I have been a fan, and have made effort to use  it for years but just never
found it to work very well (looks great tho)
If Open studio has got the bugs out I am sure many users would jump on
board- so is it ready?

Seems light and smart.
Can it make free curved forms and arbitrary connectors?

Hi All,
          The Addendum for 90.1-2004 allows to rule out G3.2.1.9 fan
power method in App G for Laboratory buildings  with fumehoods exhaust
as mentioned in advanced simulation guide

I have gone through the addendum but want to know what method to apply
to calculate baseline fan power

either just the formula should be changed from 90.1.2004 to 90.1.2007
which accounts for pressure drop adjustments or there is some other
procedure.

Thanks
Sambhav

Hello modeling community,
I've always thought that when trying to forecast an EUI for a building with a whole building energy model, the better approach would be to use 90.1 appx G PRM over Section 11 ECB. While I realize that neither one is intended for energy use predictions per se, I am curious what folks think about using Section 11. Thoughts? Pros/Cons?

Thanks,

In our work we are also leaning towards using cost intensities based on a
model rather than energy intensities to "LEED-proof" our early design
comparisons.

Shanta/Arpan,

Forecasting an EUI with energy models is a risky proposition to begin with, though many of us are asked to do so on a regular basis.  Hopefully all modelers realize that modeling is best used for making relative comparisons rather than predicting absolutes.  That said, a model can give you a much better idea of an EUI for a particular building/program than just pulling a value from the air.  Hopefully folks are looking to benchmark data to help confirm the reasonableness of their findings.


To your point about which to use, ECB or Appendix G, I would say neither.  If you're trying to determine EUI it should be based on the most representative model you can develop, not necessarily restricted by anything dictated by 90.1.  To Arpan's point about tracking cost intensities, that makes sense if LEED is part of the project or the owner is concerned with cost.  As engineers/analysts we should be thinking about energy and cost, and in some cases CO2e as well.  The final decision making metric very much depends on the goals of your client.

The challenge on many projects is a tension between energy and energy cost savings.  We have countless projects that save significant amounts of energy but score terribly in energy cost savings (using 90.1 or not as the reason to look at cost), especially with low gas prices these days.  This highlights the importance of the client's goal...if it's about saving energy, the necessary design strategies to do so may or may not also save a proportional amount of energy cost.  Thus the conundrum, energy cost as a metric is not indicative of the energy savings potential of a design path, but it is likely indicative of the likelihood for strategies to provide an economic return on investment.



Shanta, we've seen that it's good to use 90.1 App G for code and LEED modeling, and keep track of those Base and Proposed EUI's, but also consider the EUI of a "typical baseline" design that the owner/market would build and a "proposed" model that is as reflective of our actual design as possible.  It's a lot to track, especially when you add in the cost numbers for each, but it allows us to paint a more complete picture of the options and their outcomes.



Not sure if that resonates with others but would be interesting to hear what others are doing if something different.

Hello modeling community,

I would agree that, if the goal is to generate a realistic predicted EUI, there isn't much difference (or value) in choosing ECB or App G since you're not really after a baseline comparison. Focusing on determining  the most likely occupancies, schedules and how the building systems will be operated is probably the best approach when trying to predict actual energy performance. Since I think we all agree on how difficult this can sometimes be, educating the client about factors which can negatively impact performance (and hence qualifying your predictions) is a good course of action.

Maybe this goes without saying, but tenant loads and actual sequences of operation play as big, if not a bigger, factor in actual EUI, than the spec'd performance of systems (this is been the biggest lesson learned from our work with benchmarking existing buildings and retro-commissioning). In general, we have found that tenant loads are 1.5 - 2 times higher than ASRHAE defaults and a lot more if there are server rooms (even small ones). You can also usually chalk up a 10-20% increase in EUI from the "ideal" simulation results (using typical schedules and optimal operation of systems) due to changes during construction, lack of completely detailed sequences of operation, incomplete commissioning, tenant demands on schedules and set-points, and general operational "drift" that building undergo over time.

If you are in fact looking at comparisons, I personally think normalized, absolute metrics like cost and energy intensities provide more value to owners, tenants and operators compared to % savings. Benchmarking predicted performance against something like the EnergyStar Portfolio Manager is an interesting and valuable exercise.

I'm looking forward to hearing what others think about this and hearing what experiences are like out there.

Happy predicting,

Shanta/Arpan,

Forecasting an EUI with energy models is a risky proposition to begin with, though many of us are asked to do so on a regular basis.  Hopefully all modelers realize that modeling is best used for making relative comparisons rather than predicting absolutes.  That said, a model can give you a much better idea of an EUI for a particular building/program than just pulling a value from the air.  Hopefully folks are looking to benchmark data to help confirm the reasonableness of their findings.


To your point about which to use, ECB or Appendix G, I would say neither.  If you're trying to determine EUI it should be based on the most representative model you can develop, not necessarily restricted by anything dictated by 90.1.  To Arpan's point about tracking cost intensities, that makes sense if LEED is part of the project or the owner is concerned with cost.  As engineers/analysts we should be thinking about energy and cost, and in some cases CO2e as well.  The final decision making metric very much depends on the goals of your client.

The challenge on many projects is a tension between energy and energy cost savings.  We have countless projects that save significant amounts of energy but score terribly in energy cost savings (using 90.1 or not as the reason to look at cost), especially with low gas prices these days.  This highlights the importance of the client's goal...if it's about saving energy, the necessary design strategies to do so may or may not also save a proportional amount of energy cost.  Thus the conundrum, energy cost as a metric is not indicative of the energy savings potential of a design path, but it is likely indicative of the likelihood for strategies to provide an economic return on investment.



Shanta, we've seen that it's good to use 90.1 App G for code and LEED modeling, and keep track of those Base and Proposed EUI's, but also consider the EUI of a "typical baseline" design that the owner/market would build and a "proposed" model that is as reflective of our actual design as possible.  It's a lot to track, especially when you add in the cost numbers for each, but it allows us to paint a more complete picture of the options and their outcomes.



Not sure if that resonates with others but would be interesting to hear what others are doing if something different.

For our projects, we model a "typical construction baseline".  This 
model represents the Owner's concept constructed to the average new 
construction characteristics based on our experience, input from the 
design team and input from the cost consultants/contractors.  The 
Proposed design model is constructed to match the teams "concept 
vision".  Schedules are set based on the intended programming and 
adjusted for typical diversity for such a facility.

We compare these two models as well as give an indication as how the 
Proposed design might compare to the "standard" the project might be 
trying to achieve - not necessarily LEED.  Costs and energy use 
intensity is compared.

The issue with absolute EIUs is an accurate base to compare to.  As 
Luka mentioned, it would be helpful to normalize the Proposed design 
EIUs to  Portfolio Manager or another source baseline EIUs.

Yes, except we call it the "conventional" baseline for cases where the PRM baseline isn't really typical. That's case-by-case, many of our projects do have more or less reasonable baselines...so don't feel like that's a mandatory thing to do.

Basically the same approach and similar experience.

Here is a Visio-made diagram
https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxMkJIZCZN5ESnJYVFpsR3lTZVk

What do I miss? Is it satisfactory for a report/manual/paper?

First round, about 3 hours, about 10 iterations.
Just one click to get all formatting you need.
Very fast learning track.
Very useful Format painter and very flexible connectors
Less frustrating experience comparing with Word which I used before.

Next time, I hope, it's gonna take 20-30 min

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ventilated crawl space
Message-ID: <15142921.7116511339240134532.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

In a
dynamic simulation (EnergyPlus) I have to model a ventilated crawl space, like
that one in the picture http://www.ferracinsrl.it/en/vespaio4s.php

The heat
transmission through the floor is therefore influenced also by the ventilation
in that system. Have you ever modeled such a system? Should I consider as floor construction only the layers over the ventilated
crawl space and as temperature an average value among monthly air temperature,
internal temperature and ground temperature?

I have done this many times with ESP-r and there should be no reason why you cannot model
a ventilated crawl space in EnergyPlus.  The approach I used is to explicitly represent the
crawl-space as one or more thermal zones.  If you crawled around in such a space what would you
notice if you looked really closely and then imagined what thermophysical processes
are happening in a craw space at different times of the day/year.  Then create a model that 
takes these observations into account.

The base of the zone is the ground (use the ground model or at least make up a
construction that is a couple of metres thick).  The boundary of the ground is probably
something like a monthly temperature at ~2m depth. The side walls and top of the
crawl space are normal constructions. The craw-space top is connected to the
room(s) above. Is there anything in the crawl space that generates heat - if so 
include that in a schedule.

EnergyPlus allows you to setup an airflow network so you would have to do a
survey of the openings and cracks around the crawl space and represent this
in the model.  This way you will get at least some of the impact of wind outside
forcing air through the crawlspace.

Please excuse the cross-posting...and save the date!

The next IBPSA-USA meeting will be held Saturday, June 23rd, in San Antonio, TX (concurrent with the start of the ASHRAE Winter Meeting) - please plan to attend if you are in town!

A business meeting will be held from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. in Room 102B in the Convention Center adjacent to the conference hotel. No registration is required for the business meeting.

The dinner meeting will take place with social hour and registration from 6:30 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. followed by a dinner presentation until 9:00 p.m.

The location and final meeting cost are not yet finalized, although we anticipate the cost to be around $40 as with recent meetings, and the location to be walking distance from the conference hotel.

The past few meetings have been very informative concerning events in the simulation community, and provide a great opportunity to meet fellow building simulators.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the meeting or IBPSA-USA. We'll provide a additional announcements closer to the time of the meeting with the exact location, cost, and speaker details.

IBPSA-USA local chapter leaders - please forward to your membership as well.

As we did for the past meeting in Chicago, we'll have a pre-registration using Eventbright which I encourage you to use if possible.

Dear Pavel ,et al.

I use yEd ( http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html) for drawing
flow charts, venn diagrams, etc. It can easily be used for drawing HVAC
flow diagrams as well. yEd is free to download and install and is quite
powerful.


Thanks,

Thank you Anupam,

I enjoyed examples they have.
I tried it for 5 min.
I should admit it's a very intelligent/quick (should I say brilliant) in
making and playing with blocks and connectors.
During these 5 mins I failed to find a quick way to format individual
blocks and text inside blocks (color, font), except  at least 3-4
clicks  through  menus, pop-ups, dialogues.
Is there a format painter?
May be I miss some magic tricks or .....
this tool was meant for something more abstract.

Yes, this tool is a diagramming tool useful for abstract diagrams as well
as organized flowcharts. For handling labels, there should be a "Properties
View" at the lower right corner of your screen where the font, color, etc.
can be changed for the entire object. There is no format painter, though
one can take a crossing window and select the objects (or group them and
see group content: Alt+PgDn) to select similar objects before formatting
them similarly.

Hope this helps. Vaibhav (also on this list) pointed out a similar and
intuitive tool called Dia (http://dia-installer.de/), which you can try as
well. It is similar to yEd in abstractness of application though.

Cheers,
Anupam

Message-ID: <SNT118-W2306E087F7D0F270042A0184F70@phx.gbl>


Hi All,
Two quick questions as an eQUEST rookie:
1) I have a gym (25 ft tall) shell surrounded by a hallway shell (10ft). I was hoping that the gym's surfaces that touch the hall would be split into two (10 ft tall and 15ft tall) so that they would have different boundary conditions; namely that the top 15ft would be exposed to the exterior. However, the DD Wizard is making the whole thing exposed to the exterior. Is there a way around manually fixing this in the detailed mode? I really hope so!
2) In the 3D view mode, is there any way to zoom or pan (and not just rotate). If I'm going to edit things in detailed mode (see above!), then that would be pretty helpful!
Thanks in advance,

yeah, unfortunately the wizard can do that for two adjacent shells of 
differing heights.

a manual work around in detail mode is to

1. copy the wall in question, add 'ext' to the end of the name to 
differentiate it,
2.  change the elevation of the exterior wall & its height (if it is not 
defined as a polygon).
3.  change the height of what is to be the internal wall.
4.  change the definition of the internal wall to internal.  this is 
typically not as easy as simply changing the wall type definition & 
turning off the self-shading property.  sometimes it is easier to copy 
an internal wall definition to your offending space & change its 
characteristics to what you need.  the internal wall definition will 
prompt for the vertex of the space the wall starts at so you'll need to 
find that out too.  of course just changing it & watching it move around 
w/the 3d view set to wirescreen & the wall selected can narrow that down 
as well.

Hi Liam,

 

eQUEST DD wizard will split your common walls horizontally and create and
interior partition for the lower portion and an exterior surface on the
upper portion.  We have found however that it has difficulty if on the DD
wizard shell screen 2 you set the building orientation to anything other
than north = up (the default).  So our practice is to simply not rotate the
building in the wizard but rather set the building azimuth in the detailed
interface.  In this way, walls of adjacent shells are set correctly.  

 

Roofs of course are another matter entirely.

 

Cheers,

 

Brian

 

PS - this is probably a better topic for the eQUEST-users list rather than
bldg-sim.

Brian,

That's an interesting way to go about modeling your buildings.  Are you
finding the situation comes up often enough to warrant this approach?  My
only concern would be that all of your surfaces would then be named
incorrectly as far as orientation goes.  Due you go back and correct the
surface names or do you not make much use of the eQUEST wizard naming
conventions?

This sounds like the beginnings of a an elaborate/scientific office prank with the boss's thermostat... =)

In all seriousness, I believe the effect of ambient temperatures are pretty established.  Here's a brief article in layman's terms and a pretty graph:
http://productivity-science.com/blogen/post/What-temperature-is-best-for-your-productivity.aspx

Here's a research paper cited in the previous link with more info:
http://escholarship.org/uc/item/45g4n3rv#page-8

I'm not certain whether there is anything in the realm of IEQ/CO2 monitoring that establishes a clear causal effect on task productivity similar to the above.

Here's a paper that attempts to connect the dots between ventilation rates (2 levels) and annual sick-leave accrual for office workers:  http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=milton%20risk%20of%20sick%20leave%20associated%20with%20outdoor%20air%20supply%20rate%2C%20humidification%2C%20and%20occupant%20complaints&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CFoQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.e-co.uk.com%2FRecirc-Milton2000.pdf&ei=xCbRT5ujBeWL2AXWw4WxDw&usg=AFQjCNFBvi_nWYBGbwn_f6NV3hxRHn7MtA

The "dollars lost"  economical argument extrapolated in the conclusions looks dramatic, but even if we accept CO2 concentrations are tied directly to sick leave hours...  that's not quite the same thing as a direct productivity effect (i.e. my co-worker breathing heavily is preventing me from doing my work).

If you were to combine the above studies into a single model I suppose you reasonably establish a linear CO2-concentration-factor curve to apply against an ambient temperature curve to come up with a combined productivity effect.  I might sooner look further for something akin to the temperature study however.

Hey all

Can you point me towards a model which describes the office worker productivity as a function of temperature AND co2 concentration?

Many thanks in advance!

Monitoring CO2 concentrations isn't necessarily about CO2.  Sensing CO2 is only an indicator for all the other chemicals in the air.

People put off methane, wear perfume, expel formaldehyde, sweat and a whole lot of disgusting stuff.

Buildings often try to maintain 800ppm of CO2. OSHA allows exposure of 5,000ppm of CO2 for 8 hours.  The reason it is common to maintain a CO2 level which is 1/6th of the OSHA approved limits is because it isn't necessarily CO2 we are trying to control.  It is all the other smells...

This is also why it may be difficult to find a graph showing performance vs C02 levels (see bottom).  The study showed at 2500ppm no measurable difference in performance was detected.

And lastly, Why monitor CO2?  The sensors are cheap and accurate.

Without having read the documents Nick is referring to...

Recall that CO2 is a surrogate indicator of air quality.  It was never
intended to indicate that the atmosphere was unhealthy, just that it might
be unhealthy.

>From memory:

.         the original research done by ASHRAE varied outdoor air
ventilation rates in a test studio which was occupied by real people.  

.         The people were surveyed at random times for their perception of
comfort.  (Since the temperature and humidity did not vary, "comfort" was
more akin to perception of "freshness" of the air.)

.         Survey results were analyzed for correlation with ventilation
rates that existed at the time corresponding to the survey

.         There was a correlation between ventilation rate and comfort

.         The correlation was presented as ppm of CO2 assuming:

o    a specific background / outdoor air concentration (350ppm, I think)

o   sedentary people were the only generators of CO2

 

So, it seems to me that it's a BIG stretch to try to correlate productivity
with CO2.

Some information for people planning on attending the SimBuild 2012 
conference in Madison and that have not yet made their reservations for 
accommodations:

The block of rooms that has been set aside for conference attendees at 
the Madison Concourse Hotel will expire at the end of June and rates 
will return to the normal rates for hotel rooms. I have been informed 
that because of another conference in Madison that overlaps the dates of 
SimBuild that rates for hotel rooms will be significantly higher than 
the block rates for all hotels in the conference vicinity.  So I 
encourage you to make your hotel reservations by the end of the month.

The Madison Concourse Hotel

FYI...

Simulating different HVAC systems is non-trivial! ASHRAE RP-865 also has HVAC system diagrams for the accuracy tests that Standard 140 is now assembling for future reference.

Comparisons to DOE-2, BLAST and EnergyPlus have also been run on these as well (+- 1%). Spreadsheet simulations for these systems, and input files can also be found  in the ESL report ESL-TR-01-02-02, which is a report and ZIP file containing the spreadsheets, available on the ESL's web site.

Sorry for cross-posting,

Does anyone use MS Visio for sketching HVAC diagrams?
Is it a good alternative to Ms Word, which is somehow tolerable for simple diagrams, but gets really out of hands for bigger diagrams?
The shapes, which are included in Visio, are they helpful, meaningful, give professional look?

Somebody is using Excel (might be lacking flexibility when topology is unknown).
Somebody is using Inkscape.
Any other thoughts
Thank you,

I'm wondering if you can share your thoughts on your favorite tool to draft efficiently such diagrams.
Is there anything better than pencil and paper?

Dear Forum,
The schematic I have attached is a common boiler plant piping configuration in my experience, using an individual constant speed pump for each boiler, plus a variable speed distribution pump.
Officially it's a "primary - secondary pumping loop".
I cannot make the primary pumps shut off when the corresponding boiler is inactive.  Has anyone successfully modeled this configuration?  Do you know of an example file with this configuration?
Thanks in advance.

Making me think....
Why is it?  We routinely use miracles of creativity and technology that 50-100 years ago would be considered impossible or black magic ... and also assume that whole segments of society are incapable of helping themselves  or acting intelligently.  Is it a self-fulfilling expectation?

For future reference, wizards will recognize coincident vertical exterior surfaces and distinguish exterior vs. interior as you're describing, but it requires some planning when defining shells.  Attached is one of a few discussions covering this from the archives.

The model orientation issue I think Brian is getting at manifests as errors of rounding for angled geometries.  I've run into that on rare occasion - it's obvious something is wrong by the time you finish wizards.  I can see this being avoided by defining "cardinal-skewed" building to maximize orthogonal lines for spaces, but you can also spot-fix such issues after the fact by redefining geometries & shell perimeters with extra vertices, in my experience.

I would give zero concern to naming conventions of surfaces, personally, but I can see how that might cause others heartache.  I've never been one to care much if a space or component has an arbitrary name, so long as the person using the model (usually me) can figure out what's what.  If it really bothers you, you might be able to fairly quickly correct such 'misnaming' after the fact in notepad using the "replace with" function (ex:  replace all instances of "North Wall" with "North-NorthWest Wall").

To help clarify steps 3 onwards as suggested by Patrick, here is a visual step-by-step guide for turning an exterior wall into an interior wall, transcribed from another discussion from the lists:
http://onebuilding.org/wiki/doku.php/convert_an_exterior_surface_to_an_interior_surface_detailed

There are usually multiple paths to the same end for detailed geometry edits - choose whatever is most intuitive to you!

Also, 3D view has a zoom & rotate feature, but no pan (you always look at the origin).

Hold ctrl, then left-click --> mouse movement = rotate
Hold ctrl, then right-click --> mouse movement = zoom

If anyone is using a one-button mouse with eQuest, you should probably slowly put down your pencil/slide-rule, step away from your visual display terminal, and take a short trip to your office supply store for a well-deserved mouse upgrade =).

Brian,

That's an interesting way to go about modeling your buildings.  Are you finding the situation comes up often enough to warrant this approach?  My only concern would be that all of your surfaces would then be named incorrectly as far as orientation goes.  Due you go back and correct the surface names or do you not make much use of the eQUEST wizard naming conventions?

Hi Liam,

We have found however that it has difficulty if on the DD wizard shell screen 2 you set the building orientation to anything other than north = up (the default).  So our practice is to simply not rotate the building in the wizard but rather set the building azimuth in the detailed interface.  In this way, walls of adjacent shells are set correctly.

Roofs of course are another matter entirely.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest - common surface between shells and zooming in 3D

Hi All,

Two quick questions as an eQUEST rookie:

1) I have a gym (25 ft tall) shell surrounded by a hallway shell (10ft). I was hoping that the gym's surfaces that touch the hall would be split into two (10 ft tall and 15ft tall) so that they would have different boundary conditions; namely that the top 15ft would be exposed to the exterior. However, the DD Wizard is making the whole thing exposed to the exterior. Is there a way around manually fixing this in the detailed mode? I really hope so!

2) In the 3D view mode, is there any way to zoom or pan (and not just rotate). If I'm going to edit things in detailed mode (see above!), then that would be pretty helpful!

Thanks in advance,

 touch the hall would be split into two (10 ft tall and 15ft tall) so that they would have different boundary conditions; namely that the top 15ft would be exposed to the exterior. However, the DD Wizard is making the whole thing exposed to the exterior. Is
 there a way around manually fixing this in the detailed mode? I really hope so!


 


2) In the 3D view mode, is there any way to zoom or pan (and not just rotate). If I'm going to edit things in detailed
 mode (see above!), then that would be pretty helpful!


 


Thanks in advance,

Hi Andy,
 
If you define the adjacent shells in the wizards, then the answer is that the coincident walls will be modeled as an adiabatic surface(s).  They may be changed
 to an interior partition construction to model heat transfer between spaces once in detailed mode if you so desire.
 
Other coincident surfaces (roofs/floors) between shells do not exhibit this behavior upon exiting the wizards.  If left in the model, you will end up with
 non-existant, fully shaded exterior surfaces which will cause unrealistic envelope gains/losses to the adjacent spaces.
 
See Scott Criswell?s post in the extended discussion copied below.  More discussion is available in the archives but I think he put it best?

Subject: [Equest-users] Shared surfaces of composite shells

 
How are shared surfaces of composite shells modeled?



Say I have a building, 2 cubes, one larger, with a shared wall. Does equest model the shared portion of the wall as an interior wall and walls exposed to the environment as exterior.




The same question goes for other surfaces as well.



Thanks, and happy thanksgiving,



Andy

I would suggest side-to-side over stacked.
 
If you position via coordinates, and can get the adjacent planes to be in the same locations, eQuest recognize the coincident planes and automate a number of things for you.  You cannot do this via stacking shells
 on top of each other.
 
I?d suggest reviewing some specifics regarding how you go about positioning your shells from this mailing list discussion.  I can?t seem to find it in the archive to link to, but Scott Criswell outlined some
 pointers pretty helpful to the task at hand.  I?ve copied the discussion down below for your review =). 

 
I?d also suggest bookmarking this archive search page if you haven?t already ? you?ll find more information regarding shell placement if you find further trouble getting your shells to line up just right:  http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/equest-users-onebuilding.org/

It might be easier to make the two shells stacked instead of side-by-side. That way, you can specify that the top shell is open to below and by zoning the bottom shell properly, you can make the part with the
 high ceiling open to above. Just a thought.

Hello everyone,
 
I was trying to model a bldg with 50% area at 25 feet high and remaining area at 10 feet. How can I specify different heights in  the footprint of this bldg. in eQUEST?  I tried to draw in DD Wizard. First I drew a footprint with 25-foot
 height, then I tied to create a new shell with 10-foot height. I wasn?t able to put two shells together. Also, I didn?t know how to change exterior walls to interior.

 
Any help would be appreciated .

Aman

Subject: Re: [Equest-users] Roof monitor "Open to Below"
 
Just wanted to clarify something that could possibly be mis-understood from Nick's post below, when he states "eQuest will recognize two planes are on top of each other and default each to be adiabatic or partially adiabatic".

Also please note that what Nick stated is by no means incorrect - I just felt compelled to clarify some details here that are not broadly understood.



Two important points on this topic:

(1) The recognition of coincident walls works only for vertical walls (side-by-side shells), NOT horizontal walls (shells stacked on top of each other).  When shells in the wizard are placed side-by-side, then eQUEST can detect this wall coincidence and when
 generating the detailed building model will utilize interior, adiabatic walls wherever the shells are adjoining.  However, there is no such roof/floor wall  coincidence intelligence for wizard shells stacked on top of each other.  IN these cases the user should
 make sure that the Ground Floor construction of the upper shell is set to "Over Conditioned Space (adiabatic)" and the Roof Construction is set to "No Exterior Exposure (adiabatic)".



(2) This vertical wall coincidence checking mechanism lies within the wizard database and defaulting mechanism and is used to populate the detailed (DOE-2) model in such a way as to ensure proper model of side-by-side shells.  No such vertical wall coincidence
 checking exists when creating (the equivalent of) side-by-side shells in the detailed interface.  When creating such walls in the detailed interface, the user must indicate wall exposure by creating either exterior or interior (adiabatic or thermally conductive)
 walls.



Lastly - our team would like to thank Nick (and many others as well) for his contributions to this and the Bldg-Sim e-mail lists.  His detailed and accurate explanations are very beneficial to the eQUEST & building simulation community at large.

Happy to help ? I?ll point out further that the important thing when modeling varying roof heights / monitors using the ?cutting method? (and that is a term I just made up so don?t search for that explicitly),
 to save yourself some time, is to match vertices when defining the separate shells.  In doing so, eQuest will recognize two planes are on top of each other and default each to be adiabatic or partially adiabatic. 

 
This is good because on one level you won?t accidentally end up with a lot more exterior wall than you should have.  On a further level, it will save you some time later in identifying which walls need to be
 tied to adjacent zones (the adiabatic walls will stand out in spreadsheet view), if you decide you want to more accurately account for thermal behavior between the monitor zone(s) and the surroundings by defining ?Next to Space??.
 
Also, flattery will get you nowhere, but thanks for the model compliment ;).
 
Cheers!

I think you?ve identified the root of your problem ? I?m unsure that there?s any way to get light in one shell to transmit to another.
 
Attached and below is an example of a project with a lot of roof monitors that does successfully measure and account for daylighting in those spaces.  A  picture speaks a thousand words, so see if this matches
 what you were thinking to accomplish.  
 
Each monitor is a single zone and shell (i.e. no plenum zone).  Sensors are located either on the floor or at a desk height, as appropriate to the space usage.  Creating the shell that ?wraps? around the monitors
 is done by using ?cutting lines? in the footprint/zoning pattern ? you can read up on that strategy by searching the archives for how courtyards are modeled. 

 
I?ll point out, in terms of accuracy, I have the impression that eQuest?s daylight sensors do not accurately realize the full amount of light that should be encountered with light shelves, light tubes, or other
 means of interreflected daylight, based on my comparative daylight analyses using AGI32 (which I?ve learned to use accurately for daylight modeling).  The DOE2 help files I think also allude to this ? It?s something to keep in mind if you have a lot of monitor
 overhangs, again as with the example below.

Subject: [Equest-users] Roof monitor "Open to Below"
 
Hello E-quest group,
 
I am working on ways to implement Equest in my workflow for the purpose of daylighting design evaluation, and I am having trouble implementing a roof monitor. I have read the help files that describe the limitations of Equest to perform
 daylighting calculations, but I have also seen that some people have been able to implement multilevel atriums and I have seen one application of a roof monitor. Anyways I want to give it a go before I start programming in Daylight Factors.  
 
Attached is an example building I would like to be able to evaluate. My evaluation goal is to put a light meter on the bottom zone under the monitor and see what results pop out in the detailed daylighting summary reports (LS-G, LS-J, ect.)
 I would like to compare Equest results to the results of other software/calculations/measurements I am investigating, however it seems that no light from the roof monitor is making it to the bottom zone.
 
The bottom shell is all one zone and the top is all one zone. I have found that it is necessary that the bottom zone have windows or else no daylighting dialog screen shows up in the DD wizard, and that means no light meter. At first I
 tried to make the top zone ?open to below? and then in the detailed edit mode moved the light meter under the monitor, but the results do not indicate any light is making it from the roof monitor to the bottom zone.
 
I was hoping some of you might have some suggestions to help implement this roof monitor setup.
 
Thanks,
Aaron

Subject: [Bldg-sim] hdrscope: per-pixel lighting analysis tool
Message-ID: <4FD67A0B.6010502@u.washington.edu>

Colleagues,

We would like to announce the release of a new tool for image- based 
light analysis. Hdrscope is a Windows based, user friendly tool that can 
process and analyze High Dynamic Range (HDR) photographs and rendered 
images from Radiance Lighting Simulation and Visualization software. The 
analysis techniques focus on per-pixel luminance analyses. It is free 
and can be downloaded from: http://courses.washington.edu/hdrscope/

Hdrscope features a combination of existing and novel tools and image 
processing techniques. The fundamental algorithms and programs running 
behind the scenes within hdrscope are derived from Radiance software, 
and new features are added. One of the most exciting capabilities is the 
ability to isolate and analyze a region or two regions of interest from 
an image; the regions can be defined using a rectangle, circle or a 
closed polygon interactively. Luminance values, ratios, descriptive 
statistical calculations, percentile ratios, criterion rating, and 
luminance contrast are reported. The software also provides a front end 
to Evalglare. It allows for calibration using luminance measurements, or 
illuminance measurements taken at the camera level for fisheye images. 
It provides an automated image capture tool for selected Canon cameras 
to take multiple exposure photographs. ?Single aperture / multiple 
shutter speed? option is used for general image capture; and ?two 
apertures / multiple shutter speed? option is provided to capture the 
sun and the sky. We recommend Photosphere for image assembly.

The work behind the software formed the basis of my student?s 
(Viswanathan Kumaragurubaran) Master of Science thesis in Architecture 
at the University of Washington (Seattle). If you have any questions, 
feedback, or comments, please let us know (hdrscope at uw.edu).

Sheelam,
You should probably address this to the DesignBuilder Help Desk. DB allows
you to specify the import units, but since you apparently did this and it
works well in previous versions, it may be a bug in v105.  (and therefore
should be reported to DB)

Hi Sheelam,

I hope you have changed the units to Metric in Tools<Program Options<International.

[cid:image001.jpg at 01CD496E.3F52BEB0]



In DesignBuilder Metric system, units are always read in metres. The best thing to do is to scale your drawing in CAD to meters and then import it in Designbuilder. Check the measure of one of the surfaces and it should be fine.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] [Equest-users] Roof monitor "Open to Below"
Message-ID: <4FD8E702.2050808@jilldalglish.com>

Aaron,

Beyond building a roof monitor in eQuest, be very careful of the 
lighting calculation engines. It is my understanding that they are no 
more complicated than a lumen method calculation with gives accuracy 
only to an order of magnitude at best. Daylight Factors are definitely 
the better way to go for accuracy.

Best wishes,

Is there any way to obtain all the coefficients listed in APPENDIX C, 
the methodology for the envelope trade-off calculations?  Even better 
would be a text file with all the equations and the coefficients.

FYI - Appdx c is being re-written, for 90.1-2013.  When I get back to internet connectivity I can give you the addendum letter.  The goal was to streamline the baseline building generation, even automate it.

As for the current Appdx c their is no document u seek that I know exists. But it reads pretty clearly, ( as everything feeds into one equation ) so I would just go all old school and write them down.  It's only about 10 or 15 or so.

You are likely correct, I can select, copy and paste all the 
equations and coefficients from Appendix C into a text 
document.  Then it's a matter of creating a spreadsheet or Perl 
program to do the calculations.

I have been using ENVSTD for years.  The problem 
is that the Ontario Building Code has revised the 
envelope prescriptive requirements to hybrid 
values that are not matched by the current and 
past versions of ENVSTD.  Ideally one would get 
the source code and modify the lookup tables then 
recompile but I am not having any luck with that concept.

I have heard that the the ENVSTD developers are 
working on a version for Ontario but who knows 
how long that might take.  In the meantime, the 
cost of building permits goes up on July 12 so 
lots of developers are scrambling to get permits before then.

If I'm not mistaken, the trade-off approach is what COMcheck's (free software) is built around for envelope compliance calculations.  Don't believe it gets much easier ;).

Just a quick side note on this ? the EnvStd software is not included in the 90.1-2010 User?s Manual.  The last one offered was EnvStd 6.0, published with the 90.1-2007 User?s Manual.

If I?m not mistaken, the trade-off approach is what COMcheck?s (free software) is built around for envelope compliance calculations.  Don?t believe it gets much easier ;).

I have been using ENVSTD for years.  The problem is that the Ontario Building Code has revised the envelope prescriptive requirements to hybrid values that are not matched by the current and past versions of ENVSTD.  Ideally one would get the source code and modify the lookup tables then recompile but I am not having any luck with that concept.  

I have heard that the the ENVSTD developers are working on a version for Ontario but who knows how long that might take.  In the meantime, the cost of building permits goes up on July 12 so lots of developers are scrambling to get permits before then.

Chris,
 
If I understand your intent correctly, I would recommend using ENVSTD.  It makes the trade-off method less painful.  The software comes packaged with the 90.1 User?s Manual.

You are likely correct, I can select, copy and paste all the equations and coefficients from Appendix C into a text document.  Then it's a matter of creating a spreadsheet or Perl program to do the calculations.

As for the current Appdx c their is no document u seek that I know exists. But it reads pretty clearly, ( as everything feeds into one equation ) so I would just go all old school and write them down.  It's only about 10 or 15 or so.

Is there any way to obtain all the coefficients listed in APPENDIX C, 
the methodology for the envelope trade-off calculations?  Even better 
would be a text file with all the equations and the coefficients.

	USER MANUAL
Message-ID: <CAGqpaM_eOZgnnz4Km0__nzWexnCrC6NBomQ_2Aez3vWLLcrhLg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We have a 10 storey non residential building with a square footage of
1,25,220. The proposed HVAC system is a VRF. Ideally, as per ASHRAE 90.1
2004, System Type 8 VAV with Reheat (Nonresidential & More than 5 Floors or
> 150,000 sqft) is applicable. However, the following excerpt from G-22
ASHRAE User's Manual for ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004 seems to
suggest an exception.
Excerpt:
For intermediate-sized buildings that are 4 or 5 floors and less than
75,000 ft? or *more than 5 floors and between 75,000 and 150,000 ft?*, the
baseline building HVAC system for electric heat is a packaged variable air
volume (PVAV) system. When the proposed building has electric heat, then
the baseline building system has parallel type fan powered (PFP) mixing
boxes electric resistance heating both at the air handler and at the PFP
VAV boxes.

The excerpt seems to suggest System type 6 is applicable too. This seems to
be in conflict with ASHRAE 90.1. Can anybody suggest whether modelling
baseline with System type 6 is acceptable?

Piyush Varma

Again the problem wit COMcheck is the prescribed envelope 
characteristic don't match the new Ontario Building Code values.  It 
is unfortunate that COMCheck and ENVSTD have those values hard 
coded.  It would have been great if those programs had been 
constructed with a database that was open for revision based on the 
local jurisdictions requirements.

I have found a volunteer to help develop a WEB based solution.  Don't 
hold you breath, it is a spare-time project.

Message-ID: <4694354.791871339770768580.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>


If I know the dimensions of the building, the thermal conductivity
of the soil, thickness and thermal conductivities of the layers composing the slab-on-grade
floor, how can I calculate the U-factor (or Reff or the F-factor) of the floor in contact with ground?

I would like to calculate the U-factor (or Reff or the
F-factor) before I create the dynamic model in order to compare that value with
the limits of ASHRAE 90.1 Table 5.5. I know the method of the European
technical standard EN ISO 13370, but I think it is not compatible with ASHRAE
90.1, which was written in the United States.

Hi Chris,

If it's any help, I understand COMcheck is still being actively updated as I get notifications pretty often re: updates.  Considering COMcheck is inclusive of a fairly wide range of standards, some of which are state/locality-specific, you might find the folks responsible for updating/developing the software receptive to including another set of prescriptive standards if you ask the question.

Best of luck!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE code multiplier?
Message-ID: <CALKTE9TBGrZtwnJJVqaGp5RNqCDJe=DG+aov1ignf_RiFGahbg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,
I am working on creating envelope libraries for ASHRAE 90.1 2010, 2007 &
2001 code vintages.
I have a copy of ASHRAE 2010 standard and users guide, and am wondering if
there might be a general multiplier that could be used to back the
insulation levels as well as U values down to the 2007 and 2001 levels.
When I purchased the ASHRAE 2010 standard and users guide the ASHRAE rep I
spoke with mentioned that I might be able to use a multiplyer for this.
>From what I recall insulation levels where raised by 16% for ASHRAE 2010
from ASHRAE 2007, but do not know if this 16% is actually the number or not
and do not have any assumed numbers for other vintages or values.  My use
of this is for PCM modeling, sort of conceptual massing preliminary
modeling & climate studies so strict code compliance is not necessarily
required but would be preferred. I would prefer not to buy all of the
individual standards if possible so wonder if such a multiplier might be
reasonable. I would like to also do space type lighting codes & DHW (for
internal gains) as well.. If anyone has insight it would be appreciated,
and I also could share my finished work (in excel, energy plus and design
builder formats) with anyone who wanted it..

Best regards-

I?m using EE4 (Canadian Energy Modeling Software) to model centralized
water-to-water heat pumps system which provides hot/chilled water to make up
air unit heating and cooling coils respectively, there are also distributed
ground source heat pumps in the spaces which are connected to the ground to extract/reject heat. This combination of systems are not
supported in EE4, does anyone know of a work-around to model such system?

 

I appreciate any input on this ...

Hi Ahmed,

 

You can define multiple plants in EE4 - what if you created one plant for
your centralized water-to-water heat pumps and a second plant for your
distributed heat pumps?

Hi Brian, Thanks for your reply.
This is the scenario; two make up air units provide fresh air into condominium corridors. The heating and cooling coils are fed from water-to-water heat pumps. In each suite, there is a ground source heat pump. 
If i follow your suggestion, I create a CombinationGSHP plant with MAU system (perhaps i should choose 2-pipe FCU system) and assign only the zones with the corridors (since fresh air is dumped into corridors). 
The second plant would be Geothermal system with a dummy MAU system and assign suite zones under that system. I should set the fresh air quantities to zero in the suites since fresh air has been taken care off in the first plant? 
Do you think this is a good presentation of the system?

Just a quick reminder with the key details:


1.       Business meeting will be held prior to dinner at the convention center in Room 102B from 4:00 to 6:00PM - this is different from many other past meetings where the location is usually at the restaurant!



2.       Dinner meeting registration will take place from 6:30 p.m. to 7:15 p.m., located at Rio Rio Cantina, 421 E. Commerce Street, San Antonio, TX 78205 in the Estrella Room.



a.       The restaurant is a short 10 minute walk from the convention center and hotel.



b.      You can still pre-pay with a credit card using the link until before the event:                http://ibpsaannualmeeting.eventbrite.com/

c.       There is still space available for walk-up registrations. Cash or check is preferred for walk-up registrations. You will be e-mailed a receipt.

d.      Please notify me if you are a currently enrolled student as we have a trial basis for a reduced student fee. Pay at the door only.



3.       Dinner presentation by Dr. Haberl about thermal mass modeling.

4.       Cash bar during social hour and dinner.

Let me know if you have any questions, I will have access to e-mail on Saturday.

You could do that.  Given the interaction between the systems through the
OA, I would be inclined to keep them as 1 system.  Put the capacities for
the corridor system at the "system level" of your HP system type and then
the distributed heat pumps go at the zone level.   Set the system level
heating to hot water and the system level cooling to hydronic - this will be
your corridor system.

 

At the plant level, I would use an electric boiler to model the
water-to-water heat pump (which is what EE4 does behind the scene anyways
only it uses a EIR < 1 = 1/COP) - you are forced to set the efficiency to 1.
Outside of EE4, simply divide the electrical heating load by a reasonable
heating seasonal COP.  Central cooling will be a chiller representing the
cooling from your water-to-water heat pump.  

 

I'm not sure if that is clear - it is Friday afternoon after all.

Hi Brian, 

Thanks for your reply.

 

This is the scenario; two make up air units provide fresh air into
condominium corridors. The heating and cooling coils are fed from
water-to-water heat pumps. In each suite, there is a ground source heat
pump. 

 

If i follow your suggestion, I create a CombinationGSHP plant with MAU
system (perhaps i should choose 2-pipe FCU system) and assign only the zones
with the corridors (since fresh air is dumped into corridors). 

 

The second plant would be Geothermal system with a dummy MAU system and
assign suite zones under that system. I should set the fresh air quantities
to zero in the suites since fresh air has been taken care off in the first
plant? 

 

Do you think this is a good presentation of the system?

 

Regards,

Ahmed

Hi Ahmed,

 

You can define multiple plants in EE4 - what if you created one plant for
your centralized water-to-water heat pumps and a second plant for your
distributed heat pumps?

I'm using EE4 (Canadian Energy Modeling Software) to model centralized
water-to-water heat pumps system which provides hot/chilled water to make up
air unit heating and cooling coils respectively, there are also distributed
ground source heat pumps in the spaces which are connected to the ground to
extract/reject heat. This combination of systems are not supported in EE4,
does anyone know of a work-around to model such system?

 

I appreciate any input on this ...

 

Thanks,

Ahmed

See attached screen shot.  It's not entirely clear, but it sounds like you select heat pump (normally reserved for air-to-air) and EE4 applies some sort of adjustment to approximate the performance of a water-to-air heat pump.  Give it a try and see what EE4 does to the DOE file.

You could do that.  Given the interaction between the systems through the OA, I would be inclined to keep them as 1 system.  Put the capacities for the corridor system at the "system level" of your HP system type and then the distributed heat pumps go at the zone level.   Set the system level heating to hot water and the system level cooling to hydronic - this will be your corridor system.

At the plant level, I would use an electric boiler to model the water-to-water heat pump (which is what EE4 does behind the scene anyways only it uses a EIR < 1 = 1/COP) - you are forced to set the efficiency to 1.  Outside of EE4, simply divide the electrical heating load by a reasonable heating seasonal COP.  Central cooling will be a chiller representing the cooling from your water-to-water heat pump.

I'm not sure if that is clear - it is Friday afternoon after all.

Ahmed, if I understand correctly:
1. There is a ground loop that feeds 
water-to-water heat pumps.  These heat pumps 
provide heating and cooling to the make-up air 
systems - both heating and cooling coils in each 
unit so there are two loops - the hot water loop and the chilled water loop?

2.  There are WSHP units in each suite - the loop 
feeding this units comes straight from the 
ground?  Or is the temperature maintained by the 
water-to-water loop after the ground source loop?

The answers will help determine the best way to 
model starting with EE4.  You may have to finish 
the modelling by editing the .DOE file.

Jeremiah,
Unfortunately, the envelope provisions, by construction class, did not increase in stringency linearly.  By year in some cases a particular assembly increased relative to another, in some cases it did not change at all.  So, unfortunatly,
There is no easy ( accurate ) answer.   As for generalizations, most of the analysis, has been on the standard as a whole, and therefore includes all the chapters.

It seems, if you are creating a backwards tool, there are not too many assemblies, and only 3 editions to enter in the data.

As for purchasing the standard, its not a bad reference.

Dear list,
I am working on creating envelope libraries for ASHRAE 90.1 2010, 2007 & 2001 code vintages.
I have a copy of ASHRAE 2010 standard and users guide, and am wondering if there might be a general multiplier that could be used to back the insulation levels as well as U values down to the 2007 and 2001 levels. When I purchased the ASHRAE 2010 standard and users guide the ASHRAE rep I spoke with mentioned that I might be able to use a multiplyer for this. From what I recall insulation levels where raised by 16% for ASHRAE 2010 from ASHRAE 2007, but do not know if this 16% is actually the number or not and do not have any assumed numbers for other vintages or values.  My use of this is for PCM modeling, sort of conceptual massing preliminary modeling & climate studies so strict code compliance is not necessarily required but would be preferred. I would prefer not to buy all of the individual standards if possible so wonder if such a multiplier might be reasonable. I would like to also do space type lighting codes & DHW (for internal gains) as well.. If anyone has insight it would be appreciated, and I also could share my finished work (in excel, energy plus and design builder formats) with anyone who wanted it..

Best regards-

Leonard,
Thank you you have answered my question.  I will just start with the 2010
version I have and buy the other standards if needed. The multiplier would
have been nice, but I understand the issue with it..
 You might be able to help me with this one value> Would you know
what envelope changes where most common from 90.1 2007 to 2010?

Thanks

Hi Jeremiah, you might want to take a look at the Building Component Library (bcl.nrel.gov).  The construction assemblies that NREL uses to approximate the ASHRAE standards are available there in OSM and IDF formats:

https://bcl.nrel.gov/search/apachesolr_search/Construction%20Assembly#q=Construction%2520Assembly%3Ffilters%3Dtid%253A127

The latest OpenStudio application allows searching for and downloading construction components from the BCL from within the application.  The OpenStudio installer also includes Ruby bindings which can programmatically access the BCL.  Finally, Alan Jackson has posted some Python scripts which can be used to convert the IDF files to INP format:

http://openrevit.com/2012/05/idf-to-inp-converter-for-nrel-bcl/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=idf-to-inp-converter-for-nrel-bcl

Hope that helps,
Dan

There's also the E+ models created to evaluate the energy savings of
90.1... there are models for 2004, 2007, and 2010 for 16 building types in
all the climate zones:

Kris,

Refer ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Appendix G Table G3.1 item 6 for the Proposed
Building Performance.

Yes, you have to go through the lighting layout and calculate the power for
each zone.

Robby, Thanks for your response. I did see that section. It just gets confusing because the same section seems to indicate that the baseline lighting power density can be based on whole building method. Also the LEED EAp2 1.4 template excel spreadsheet has entries to indicate weather the lighting is based on space-by-space or building area method.
thanks
raj

Kris,

There was a detail discussion on the same issue few weeks before on eQuest
forum. you can check the archives by following key word:
"Building area method ASHRAE 90.1"
Hope you will get all your doubts clear there!

Thanks!

Javed is right - that discussion on [Equest-users] pretty much covered all angles of this topic - recommended reading!  Following is an additional response I threw together for Robby/Kris that I think nails down some grey areas:

I may be reading the question differently, but I would add the space-by-space method is not a requirement.  It's usually a good idea from a "I want to get more LEED points perspective," as the space-by-space approach often yields a higher allowable LPD overall, but one can choose to model the proposed and baseline either using the building area or space-by-space approach.  Do not however mix your approaches between the models.

This point (being able to use either method to tally/model LPD) is pretty explicitly made in the same cited Table G3.1 section under the Baseline requirements.

If the lighting designer has calculated the installed LPD, nothing in the standard dictates the modeler must perform separate takeoffs ... but expect to shoulder blame if those calculations do not satisfy the reviewers.  From personal experience, I advise against placing a heavy amount of trust in others' LPD calcs.  Energy models are only ever as strong as the weakest inputs used to build them.

Dear colleagues,

I was wondering if you know of a template detailing indicative tasks and resources required to guide the "as construction" certification process for a 20,000m2 project (i.e. certification management), assuming that the contractor has never build an environmentally certified building before.

Any help will be greatly appreciated

Thanks in advance
Ioannis

Hi All,

We are looking for someone to help us (long term) with translation of building simulation material from English to French. Can anyone help us with this? Or can you recommend some (professional) translator that you know is able to translate software/HVAC/simulation related text?

Best regards,

Nick is right you can use the BAM in the proposed design if you choose. However the challenge i have found with that approach is you may end up with thermal zones that have higher LPD then actually installed which may lead to high unmet cooling hours.

Philosophically I'm not a fan of using BAM because it's too easy to move lighting power from high LPD areas with few burn hours to low LPD areas with high burn hours which artificially inflates the baseline. This is part of the reason you can't mix BAM and SBS methods.

It?s usually a good idea from a ?I want to get more LEED points perspective,? as the space-by-space approach often yields a higher allowable LPD overall, but one can choose to model the proposed and baseline either using the building area or space-by-space approach.  Do not however mix your approaches between the models.

From personal experience, I advise against placing a heavy amount of trust in others? LPD calcs.  Energy models are only ever as strong as the weakest inputs used to build them.

It just gets confusing because the same section seems to indicate that the baseline lighting power density can be based on whole building method. Also the LEED EAp2 1.4 template excel spreadsheet has entries to indicate weather the lighting is based on space-by-space or building area method.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] State of the art in lighting simulation for building
	science: a literature review
Message-ID: <4B0F9EF30FB8654F88EC762FF52FDA620A83AAFC@UKEXBE02.UK.CorpLAN.net>

This paper, authored by Carlos E. Ochoaa, Myriam B.C. Aries & Jan L.M.
Hensen and published in IBPSA's official journal, the Journal of
Building Performance Simulation, examines the current state of the art
in lighting simulation related to building science research. Discussion
on historical developments and main modelling approaches is followed by
describing lighting simulation within the design process, where it is
applied beyond presentation renderings. Works are grouped using the main
aspects of a program (input, modelling and output). Lighting simulation
currently focuses on representing accurately a large number of common
situations encountered by building designers and researchers. Existing
models apply roughly the same theoretical algorithms and calculation
aids, limiting representation of certain physical phenomena. Although
some models can be used for element design, they are not practical
enough to develop or prototype new, untested elements. Elaborate
building components require separate analysis through complex simulation
aids. Few tools support the early architectural design process.
Simplification applies when integrating lighting simulation to
whole-building simulation. Input quality affects accuracy, while output
needs careful expert interpretation.

Dear Forums,

I am busy preparing a short talk for the Fall ASHRAE Energy Modeling
Conference.  The topic is "An Approach for Calibrating Existing Building
Energy Models to their Utility Consumption".

As part of the preparation, I will address the issue of how much difference
might result in energy conservation measure savings predictions if you use
actual weather data for the billing period versus TMY data.  

To get a rough idea  how much variation there might be, I looked at Degree
Days for a span of years.  What a variation! (for the city I'm studying at
least)

I am not yet sure how that affects total energy consumption - you'll have to
attend my presentation in Atlanta to find out J.

In the meantime, I am starting to think that existing building energy models
should use actual weather, not TMY data.  Have any of you run similar
comparisons for existing building models?

Hi;
I heartily recommend Google Translate.

It converts up to about  2 long paragraphs at a time, and has 2 voice hot
buttons so you can hear the words spoken in the source or target language.

The German to / from English is very good.

I would contact Zheng O'Neill. She was commissioned to do a similar study
for the Dept. of Defense as part of her work at United Technologies, which
she presented at IBPSA New York.

Jim,

Actual weather data should be more important for calibrating a model to utility bills than for predicting ECM savings. Calibration usually corresponds to one year of utility data, and as you show below, weather can be highly variable year-to-year. (You could calibrate to an average of multiple years of data, and the variability would be reduced, making actual weather data less important.) For predicting savings however, you are concerned with performance over a period of five to twenty years (or whatever the expected lifetime of the measure is), so weather variability should have minimal influence.

It is an easy exercise to test the sensitivity of a particular model to weather by doing parametric runs using weather files from cities that are somewhat hotter or colder, say a few hundred miles north or south. This older study found 5% or less difference in general between using actual and TMY data (p. 58 of 128):

Of course, YMMV.

Best of luck with your presentation,
Bill

Dear Forums,
I am busy preparing a short talk for the Fall ASHRAE Energy Modeling Conference.  The topic is "An Approach for Calibrating Existing Building Energy Models to their Utility Consumption".
As part of the preparation, I will address the issue of how much difference might result in energy conservation measure savings predictions if you use actual weather data for the billing period versus TMY data.
To get a rough idea  how much variation there might be, I looked at Degree Days for a span of years.  What a variation! (for the city I'm studying at least)
I am not yet sure how that affects total energy consumption - you'll have to attend my presentation in Atlanta to find out :).
In the meantime, I am starting to think that existing building energy models should use actual weather, not TMY data.  Have any of you run similar comparisons for existing building models?

Thanks to all who responded so far!

The two main points so far (without reading any of the suggested articles
and for all of you who have not yet had the pleasure of modeling an existing
building) are:

.         Use actual weather data for calibrating an energy model to actual
energy use. 

o   This eliminates weather as an estimated variable and gives greater
confidence regarding your understanding of all the other variables.

.         Use TMY data (or a generic weather pattern) for savings
predictions.  

o   This eliminates the likelihood of predicting savings based on a
non-representative recent weather pattern.

 

I have lots of new reading as a result of this post and am looking forward
to it.  Interesting that this is not really a new topic, as evidenced by the
1997 and 1998 publications referenced by some of you!

I've been thinking a fair amount lately about the huge and untapped savings
potential in existing buildings, but have not figured out the right sales
pitch for the owners yet.  It seems that they have about 20 other factors
affecting their incentive for improving building operations.  I'm not giving
up, however; there is too much good to be accomplished! (not to mention
challenge, learning and income J)

I agree that if you are trying to calibrate a model to actual utility bills,
you should use actual weather data.  That is not practical for eQuest as
well as other programs so then the next best thing is to check the TMY or
weather file against the actual weather. 

 

If there is a significant difference between the TMY and the actual data,
then I would adjust the utility baseline to the TMY data.  Linear
regressions typically work well for heating applications.  For cooling, it
doesn't work as well but if you are in a dry climate it should be okay.

Dear Forums,

I am busy preparing a short talk for the Fall ASHRAE Energy Modeling
Conference.  The topic is "An Approach for Calibrating Existing Building
Energy Models to their Utility Consumption".

As part of the preparation, I will address the issue of how much difference
might result in energy conservation measure savings predictions if you use
actual weather data for the billing period versus TMY data.  

To get a rough idea  how much variation there might be, I looked at Degree
Days for a span of years.  What a variation! (for the city I'm studying at
least)

I am not yet sure how that affects total energy consumption - you'll have to
attend my presentation in Atlanta to find out J.

In the meantime, I am starting to think that existing building energy models
should use actual weather, not TMY data.  Have any of you run similar
comparisons for existing building models?

Hi Jim,

Using actual local weather data (AMY vs. TMY) corresponding to the utility bills being calibrated against is standard practice in my experience.  I started out using TMY weather and quickly ran into pitfalls as you're alluding to.

EnergyPro can "normalize" the "predicted" results using historical 
weather data.  It seems to work.

I've always thought it was a "no-brainer" to use actual weather data whenever you're 
comparing simulation results to actual consumption data.  Even with the earliest 
degree-day software such as
PRISM (Princeton Scorekeeping Method) in the 1980's, it was stressed to use the degree days
from the period of record, and not the long-term average, so I'm not sure why this (using 
actual
year weather data) is such a revelation.

The variation in total energy consumption of course depends a lot on the building 
characteristics.
Back in 1996, Dru Crawley and I wrote a paper on "Does it matter which weather data you 
use in energy simulations?", for the ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings 
(it also appeared as two
separate ASHRAE papers at around the same time) where we took some prototypical building 
models (Dru did commercial, I did residential) and ran them with various "typical year" 
weather files and also 25 years of historical data in 10-12 US locations.

Hi all,
I am trying to get some benchmarks for the energy use intensity for universities in Canada/Ontario in particular and found two different reports with two different EUIs. I've tried with the Office of Energy Efficiency but no luck so far.
Hoping someone in the forum from my Canadian colleagues can shed some lights on the difference between the 2 surveys. The email sent is below.
Thanks

Hi,
I was looking for some numbers on Energy Use Intensities for Universities for a project we are working on and found 2 different documents. These reports don't give similar results when it comes to the EUI and I hope you can help me understand the difference and which number I can use. The two reports in question are:

1.       Consumption of Energy Survey for Universities, Colleges and Hospitals, 2003 (http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/corporate/statistics/neud/dpa/data_e/consumption03/pdf/consumption.pdf)

2.       2008 Commercial & Institutional Consumption of Energy Survey (http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/publications/statistics/cices08/pdf/cices08.pdf)

The 2003 report is showing a EUI of 2.19 GJ/m2 (108 kBTU/ft2) for Ontario. It was specified that the survey covered 37 campuses in Ontario.

Although the sample surveyed has almost doubled between the two reports, I believe there are other issues that might explain the difference and I hope you can shed more lights on this difference.

Looking forward to hear from you,

Hi all,
I am trying to get some benchmarks for the energy use intensity for universities in Canada/Ontario in particular and found two different reports with two different EUIs. I've tried with the Office of Energy Efficiency but no luck so far.
Hoping someone in the forum from my Canadian colleagues can shed some lights on the difference between the 2 surveys. The email sent is below.
Thanks

Hi,
I was looking for some numbers on Energy Use Intensities for Universities for a project we are working on and found 2 different documents. These reports don't give similar results when it comes to the EUI and I hope you can help me understand the difference and which number I can use. The two reports in question are:

1.       Consumption of Energy Survey for Universities, Colleges and Hospitals, 2003 (http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/corporate/statistics/neud/dpa/data_e/consumption03/pdf/consumption.pdf)

2.       2008 Commercial & Institutional Consumption of Energy Survey (http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/publications/statistics/cices08/pdf/cices08.pdf)

The 2003 report is showing a EUI of 2.19 GJ/m2 (108 kBTU/ft2) for Ontario. It was specified that the survey covered 37 campuses in Ontario.

Dear Joe,

No fair! You  and Dru have been at the forefront energy modeling research
for most of my adult life, and have a big head start.

My guess is that you spent a lot of time preparing the actual weather files
for the research, however.  Unless I'm missing something, the ready
availability of high quality (e.g., no big hunks of missing data) actual
weather data has been pretty limited until recently.  With folk like Weather
Analytics getting on board and making it pretty easy to get and inexpensive,
it becomes a lot faster and lower cost than trying to clean some of the NOAA
/ NCDC data, not to mention getting good data for sites not in or near a
major city.

Kudos for being way ahead of the industry curve (at least my own curve)!
It's getting easier to catch up!

p.s., Dru sent me that paper and I'll be reading it with interest very soon.

I've always thought it was a "no-brainer" to use actual weather data
whenever you're comparing simulation results to actual consumption data.
Even with the earliest degree-day software such as 
PRISM (Princeton Scorekeeping Method) in the 1980's, it was stressed to use
the degree days 
from the period of record, and not the long-term average, so I'm not sure
why this (using actual
year weather data) is such a revelation.

The variation in total energy consumption of course depends a lot on the
building characteristics.
Back in 1996, Dru Crawley and I wrote a paper on "Does it matter which
weather data you use in energy simulations?", for the ACEEE Summer Study on
Energy Efficiency in Buildings (it also appeared as two
separate ASHRAE papers at around the same time) where we took some
prototypical building models (Dru did commercial, I did residential) and ran
them with various "typical year" weather files and also 25 years of
historical data in 10-12 US locations.

Dear Forums,

I am busy preparing a short talk for the Fall ASHRAE Energy Modeling
Conference.  The topic is "An Approach for Calibrating Existing Building
Energy Models to their Utility Consumption".

As part of the preparation, I will address the issue of how much difference
might result in energy conservation measure savings predictions if you use
actual weather data for the billing period versus TMY data.  

To get a rough idea  how much variation there might be, I looked at Degree
Days for a span of years.  What a variation! (for the city I'm studying at
least)

I am not yet sure how that affects total energy consumption - you'll have to
attend my presentation in Atlanta to find out J.

In the meantime, I am starting to think that existing building energy models
should use actual weather, not TMY data.  Have any of you run similar
comparisons for existing building models?

Jim,

Sorry if I came off as a little smug.  You've actually put in words the main reason why I 
think building energy modelers have steered away from using historical weather data, which 
is simply that of  convenience, i.e., there are a lot of "typical year" weather files 
floating around, but getting hold of
a usable historical year weather file takes a little more work.

For the study that I mentioned, Dru and I did not have to do anything because the SANSOM 
data set,
available from NCDC, contained 25 years of historical weather files for 239 cities (same 
as TMY2s).

That was in 1996, and the availability of historical weather data has only increased 
exponentially since
then, although the building energy modeling community seems curiously to not have followed.
The most notable change, in my view, is NCDC's decision to put the entire ISH (Integrated 
Surface Hourly) data online in 2005, and then to make it free to all in 2011.  This means 
that the raw weather reports
from major stations around the world ( ~ 1,500 in the US) are available stretching back to 
1980.

I've been working with the ISH for many years now, and am able to generate complete 
weather files from any ISH file within seconds, and have been providing that as a service 
to customers.  Sometime later this
year, I'll be rolling out something on the Web, but for now, those interested can just 
send me an e-mail.

The idea that the ISH is of questionable quality is, in my view, rather backwards.  The 
ISH is a repository of the weather reports by the "official" weather stations around the 
world, so if you can't trust that, what can you trust?

I have a different take on this. I think a TMY is good enough for doing
model calibration that is used for ECM savings analysis on a whole building
level and yearly basis - I think this is the type of project Jim is
alluding to. In this scheme of things, the most important factors are the
scheduling of the various equipment/loads and the control logic and
gathering relevant data and making sure that the bills actually represent
the building in question properly. If you are going for hourly calibrations
etc, or calibrating to the few weeks of trend data that is collected,
then may be actual weather data is useful, although not 100% convinced on
this - depends on how much data one is able to collect.

If we go for a retrofit of a typical commercial building which is
mostly internal loads dominated (unless the perimeter to sqft is a lot
more-I am sure you can find papers related to this), I am not sure if
weather related issues are as important. Also, while doing retrofit, you
have access to three or more years of utility bill. Averaging out the
utility bills (removing obviously outlier data) and calibrating to it is a
reasonable way of proceeding to decide the savings due to ECMs. This takes
care of the weather issues as well as all the operating/internal load
issues that are also changing over time. Now you are no longer dealing with
one year.

It obviously depends on the building type - OA dominated buildings get
calibrated better with actual data - even here the more important data is
the amount of OA coming into the building and the control logic.

Residential and small buildings are a different category - they will get
calibrated better with actual data.

I agree with Jim that only recently a easy/non-time consuming way of using
actual data has become available. Has anyone tried it (the files from
weather analytics or equivalent) - is it as easy as using TMY without
having to worry if the results discrepancy is due to issues in the weather
file?

I agree that measured weather data is the best way to go, but it is also difficult to get everything you need for a complete weather file. However, there are middle of the road approaches that work very well.  Typically, the most important variables are the temperature and RH, which are also the easiest to measure or get from local weather stations.  An easy approach is to replace the temperature and RH (or dew point temperature) data in the TMY file with your measured data.  If you don't have hourly measured data, you can also adjust the temperatures up or down based on daily or monthly measured data.  I have done this quite successfully on several projects.

I have a different take on this. I think a TMY is good enough for doing model calibration that is used for ECM savings analysis on a whole building level and yearly basis - I think this is the type of project Jim is alluding to. In this scheme of things, the most important factors are the scheduling of the various equipment/loads and the control logic and gathering relevant data and making sure that the bills actually represent the building in question properly. If you are going for hourly calibrations etc, or calibrating to the few weeks of trend data that is collected, then may be actual weather data is useful, although not 100% convinced on this - depends on how much data one is able to collect.

If we go for a retrofit of a typical commercial building which is mostly internal loads dominated (unless the perimeter to sqft is a lot more-I am sure you can find papers related to this), I am not sure if weather related issues are as important.

I've always thought it was a "no-brainer" to use actual weather data whenever you're comparing simulation results to actual consumption data.  Even with the earliest degree-day software such as
PRISM (Princeton Scorekeeping Method) in the 1980's, it was stressed to use the degree days
from the period of record, and not the long-term average, so I'm not sure why this (using actual
year weather data) is such a revelation.

The variation in total energy consumption of course depends a lot on the building characteristics.
Back in 1996, Dru Crawley and I wrote a paper on "Does it matter which weather data you use in energy simulations?", for the ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings (it also appeared as two
separate ASHRAE papers at around the same time) where we took some prototypical building models (Dru did commercial, I did residential) and ran them with various "typical year" weather files and also 25 years of historical data in 10-12 US locations.

I think it's difficult to "calibrate" using only annual whole building data.  Most of the 
calibration that I've been involved uses monthly billing data and even at that admittedly 
coarse level, using the actual year weather data becomes important, since the degree days 
by month can easily vary by 40% or more year to year.

But there's another thing that puzzles me - when there are so many unknowns in the input 
data, isn't it a relief whenever it's possible to eliminate one of them, like the weather 
data?  Asked another way, if you had the weather data for the right time period, why would 
you not use it?

Perhaps the question gets back to convenience, and this is where I say that building 
modelers should get better acquainted with what's now available in historical weather 
data.  Just remember that every "typical year" weather file is made from many years of 
historical weather data. So, at any time historical year data  should be more plentiful 
than "typical year" weather data.  The only question is how to get it.  Happily, now that 
the ISH is online, there's very little need to search elsewhere, at least for the US.

If you want to see the situation for 2010,  look at
  http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/WB-weather/google-select.php
which shows all the ISH stations for which I've already created simulation-ready weather 
files.

My experience here in Canada is that the larger organizations with 
existing big buildings have done a significant amount of work over 
the past decade to reduce energy use.  I know a number of firms that 
specialize in energy management that are very busy with organizations 
like the banks, large utilities, etc.

The one thing to remember when pitching energy improvement is that if 
energy use costs $2.00 per square foot, employees cost $20 per square 
foot.  Owners like benefits that keep employees happy.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Re. actual weather data
Message-ID: <20120628231419.1BBE38DB165B@zapata.dreamhost.com>

Carol, how are you doing?  Long time no contact.

I sent a reply bldgsim but I thought I would send this to you directly.

 From your email:

"I agree that if you are trying to calibrate a model to actual 
utility bills, you should use actual weather data.  That is not 
practical for eQuest as well as other programs so then the next best 
thing is to check the TMY or weather file against the actual weather.

We have been creating TRY (actual weather data files) for DOE2.1e for 
since 1995.  It was harder before without Excel and add in 
psychrometric functions.

Environment had a huge number of weather stations with hourly data - 
some with full weather data and some with only a few data 
channels.  Some stations were daytime hours only.  One had to request 
a period of data and pay a setup fee.  The setup fee was more than 
the data fee so it paid to request a bunch of sites at the same 
time.  We were doing an ongoing study for BC Hydro and we created 
hourly weather files for 21 sites around BC for a period of 5 years, 
updating every quarter.

We have an old C-code processor that converts the EC data into an old 
DOE2.1e format text format for conversion to a .WTH binary weather 
file.  The processor could use a number of different channels 
depending on the weather site.  The input file signalled what 
channels were coming in the text file.  The Hirsh processor can 
convert .WTH files to .bin files.

Environment Canada now has hourly data available for much fewer 
sites.  Cut backs closed dozens of sites across the country.  There 
is a significant difference in weather between places like Revelstoke 
and the closest site with TMY weather.  With the availability of 
stations in smaller places, one could aggregate a weather file that 
captured the differences in temperature and humidity at least, then 
create a DOE2.1e weather file that town.

The good thing to happen with Environment Canada is that the WEB site 
makes hourly data available on line for a large number of stations 
across the country.  You can download a month at a time to a .csv 
file.  It takes 5 minutes to get a years worth of data required for a 
DOE2 weather file.  We now have a spreadsheet with the appropriate 
psychometric functions that converts the EC data to TRY data.  We 
just save the data to a text file for the Hirsh weather 
processor.  Then add the file to the equest weather directory and 
Bob's your uncle.

We use these TRY files for M&V projects.

Let me know if you would like any files for Toronto from over past 13 
years.  I have done some projects calibrating downtown office 
buildings to help determine the cost effectiveness of switching to 
the Enwave cooling system.   I would be happy to give you one of 
these Toronto files.  Don't tell Curt .

You just need to help me with the Equest refrigeration version for a 
cold storage warehouse - and a hockey arena ;-)
Seriously, I recall that you did model an arena at one point.  It 
would be helpful to get some guidance from you.  I have a couple of 
projects I am using the old Wizard for and it would be interesting to 
compare with the Equest refrigeration version.

The discussion has become two discussions - 
weather data and processing. And calibrating to 
TRY (what I call acutal weather data for the same 
billing period) or TMY, tyipcal weather data.

Environment had a number of weather stations with 
hourly data - some with full weather data and 
some with only a few data channels.  Some 
stations were daytime hours only.  One had to 
request a period of data and pay a setup 
fee.  The setup fee was more than the data fee so 
it paid to request a bunch of sites at the same time.
We have an old C-code processor that converts the 
EC data into an old DOE2.1e format text format 
for conversion to a .WTH binary weather 
file.  The processor could use a number of 
different channels depending on the weather 
site.  The input file signalled what channels 
were coming in the text file.  The Hirsh 
processor can convert .WTH files to .bin files.

Environment Canada now has hourly data available 
for much fewer sites.  Cut backs closed dozens of 
sites across the country.  There is a significant 
difference in weather between places like 
Revelstoke and the closest site with TMY 
weather.  With the availability of stations 
smaller places, one could aggregate a weather 
file that captured the differences in temperature and humidity at least.

The good thing to happen with Environment Canada 
is that the WEB site makes hourly data available 
on line for a large number of stations across the 
country.  You can download a month at a time to a 
.csv file.  We now have a spreadsheet with the 
appropriate psychometric functions that converts 
the EC data to TRY data.  We just save the data 
to a text file for the Hirsh weather processor.

We use these TRY files for M&V projects.

Jim,

Sorry if I came off as a little smug.  You've actually put in words the main reason why I think building energy modelers have steered away from using historical weather data, which is simply that of  convenience, i.e., there are a lot of "typical year" weather files floating around, but getting hold of
a usable historical year weather file takes a little more work.

For the study that I mentioned, Dru and I did not have to do anything because the SANSOM data set,
available from NCDC, contained 25 years of historical weather files for 239 cities (same as TMY2s).

That was in 1996, and the availability of historical weather data has only increased exponentially since
then, although the building energy modeling community seems curiously to not have followed.
The most notable change, in my view, is NCDC's decision to put the entire ISH (Integrated Surface Hourly) data online in 2005, and then to make it free to all in 2011.  This means that the raw weather reports
from major stations around the world ( ~ 1,500 in the US) are available stretching back to 1980.

I've been working with the ISH for many years now, and am able to generate complete weather files from any ISH file within seconds, and have been providing that as a service to customers.  Sometime later this
year, I'll be rolling out something on the Web, but for now, those interested can just send me an e-mail.

The idea that the ISH is of questionable quality is, in my view, rather backwards.  The ISH is a repository of the weather reports by the "official" weather stations around the world, so if you can't trust that, what can you trust?

Dear Joe,

No fair! You  and Dru have been at the forefront energy modeling research for most of my adult life, and have a big head start.

My guess is that you spent a lot of time preparing the actual weather files for the research, however.  Unless I?m missing something, the ready availability of high quality (e.g., no big hunks of missing data) actual weather data has been pretty limited until recently.  With folk like Weather Analytics getting on board and making it pretty easy to get and inexpensive, it becomes a lot faster and lower cost than trying to clean some of the NOAA / NCDC data, not to mention getting good data for sites not in or near a major city.

Kudos for being way ahead of the industry curve (at least my own curve)!  It?s getting easier to catch up!

p.s., Dru sent me that paper and I?ll be reading it with interest very soon.

I've always thought it was a "no-brainer" to use actual weather data whenever you're comparing simulation results to actual consumption data.  Even with the earliest degree-day software such as
PRISM (Princeton Scorekeeping Method) in the 1980's, it was stressed to use the degree days
from the period of record, and not the long-term average, so I'm not sure why this (using actual
year weather data) is such a revelation.

The variation in total energy consumption of course depends a lot on the building characteristics.
Back in 1996, Dru Crawley and I wrote a paper on "Does it matter which weather data you use in energy simulations?", for the ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings (it also appeared as two
separate ASHRAE papers at around the same time) where we took some prototypical building models (Dru did commercial, I did residential) and ran them with various "typical year" weather files and also 25 years of historical data in 10-12 US locations.

Dear Forums,

I am busy preparing a short talk for the Fall ASHRAE Energy Modeling Conference.  The topic is ?An Approach for Calibrating Existing Building Energy Models to their Utility Consumption?.

As part of the preparation, I will address the issue of how muc h difference might result in energy conservation measure savings predictions if you use actual weather data for the billing period versus TMY data.

To get a rough idea  how much variation there might be, I looked at Degree Days for a span of years.  What a variation! (for the city I?m studying at least)

I am not yet sure how that affects total energy consumption ? you?ll have to attend my presentation in Atlanta to find out J.

In the meantime, I am starting to think that existing building energy models should use actual weather, not TMY data.  Have any of you run similar comparisons for existing building models?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Estimating performance curve using BEMS data
Message-ID: <000301cd55a9$a71ad540$f5507fc0$@skku.edu>

Dear colleagues,

 

I?m studying on application of BEMS data to energy model calibration. 

 

By the benefit of BEMS and BAS, we can obtain easily the operation
condition data of the primary and secondary systems (chiller and boiler and
pumps and fans) stored in the database (about 2~3 years or more). 

 

My question is, 

-       If put the right sensors in the right places, is it possible to
estimate the system performance curve (chillers, boilers, fans, pumps)
properly using BEMS data? 

 

I appreciate any input on this. 

(any suggestion for further readings are also appreciated)

 

Thanks in advance. 

 

Best regards, 

Deuk-Woo Kim

Classification: UNCLASSIFIED
Caveats: NONE

Many building control systems measure the outside air temperature, can the building's own measured outside air temperature be used?  If you assume that the building can also measure wet-bulb temperature this still leaves cloud cover & wind speed (I'm not sure what other factors are involved)

Maybe a person could use the build's measurements and splice in any remaining variables from actual annual data and if there are still gaps, fill in with average data.

This brings up a big question; is there a right or wrong way to do it? Any set standards?

Message-ID: <CBABAE2AD25BED409E6C7648D098E7854689DDDC14@SBS.aei.local>

Hey all,
I am a new user of eQUEST, and I have a couple of questions regarding a model of a small single family residential home I am modeling.
1. Under general information, is there any way to specify the building as single family? I have it set to multi family low rise, because I did not see a single family option
2. Does allocating the building activity area as residential default basic household appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines, or do I have to also specify that there is self contained refrigeration
3. It is a house without a ventilation or AC system, but I cannot seem to get rid of ventilation fans. How can I indicate to the program that there are no ventilation fans at all?

Thanks a lot,
Dustin

All:

On a related note - Thanks to Brian Fountain, a very intriguing (free) piece of energy simulation software called Sim-EB (available here: https://www.simeb.ca/) which focuses on modeling existing commercial buildings recently came to my attention. While quite powerful, the Sim-EB software provides a number of unique features that I think are appropriate to this discussion:


1)      Given 'monthly' utility consumption and demand, and user-defined input parameter constraints, Sim-EB provides an interface for supporting 'auto-calibration' of DOE2.1e models.

2)      Given user defined building descriptions of elements common across the engines, (form, fabric, HVAC, controls, etc), provides a means for using either DOE2.1e, DOE2.2 or EnergyPlus to perform calculaitons

3)      Allows for easy import of user edited .inp files or .idf into the Sim-EB software.  These files could have been created elsewhere, and just use Sim-EB for calibration or analysis, results review, etc.

4)      Has a user website (https://www.simeb.ca:8443/index_fr.jsp,) which automatically creates and emails to users a user defined hourly 'AMY' model files (for Quebec related cities) to support model calibration.

5)      Give a flexible, uniform data series (short term data logger data, 15 minute energy data, etc.), Sim-EB  provides a flexible clustering tool for observing 'day-type load profiles' from  within a larger data set. One can cluster model output as well, as Sim-EB provides a good visualization tool for comparing (day-type load profile) clusters of model output to clusters of metered data.

#2) lets people see, even for a shoebox model, the differences in the loads/systems/plants between DOE2.1, DOE2.2 and EPlus  calculation methodologies. Of course, there are a great deal of 'switches' between the three different simulation engines that the software automatically sets, but one can export the input files and study the switch settings if they need to.

#5) above supports a case of real field data informing model input, i.e. the generation of hourly schedules given actual, real data!

,
This software was created and is distributed by the good folks at Hydro Quebec. As such, it supports both English and Metric units and the menu trees can be switched between French and English (but the help is in French only). I've use the Google translator tool and the example files to learn how to use the tool successfully.  There are great pdf reports distributed along with the software which describe the clustering algorithms, the auto-calibration routines, etc.

Finally - if one renames the Sim-Eb   .swdf file format weather files with a  .zip extension, you can see how to replace them with non-Canadian files. It's a bit of a pain, but possible.

While it is certainly no panacea, I personally think this tool is a demonstration of how simulation software could be used to 'marry' simulation input/output  with field data collection to provide 'better' calibrated simulations for examining retrofit potential. Recognizing the 'perfect is not the enemy of the good', this software, IMHO, forms a good compromise towards using energy models to create actionable results.

All the Best,

Jim,

Sorry if I came off as a little smug.  You've actually put in words the main reason why I think building energy modelers have steered away from using historical weather data, which is simply that of  convenience, i.e., there are a lot of "typical year" weather files floating around, but getting hold of
a usable historical year weather file takes a little more work.

For the study that I mentioned, Dru and I did not have to do anything because the SANSOM data set,
available from NCDC, contained 25 years of historical weather files for 239 cities (same as TMY2s).

That was in 1996, and the availability of historical weather data has only increased exponentially since
then, although the building energy modeling community seems curiously to not have followed.
The most notable change, in my view, is NCDC's decision to put the entire ISH (Integrated Surface Hourly) data online in 2005, and then to make it free to all in 2011.  This means that the raw weather reports
from major stations around the world ( ~ 1,500 in the US) are available stretching back to 1980.

I've been working with the ISH for many years now, and am able to generate complete weather files from any ISH file within seconds, and have been providing that as a service to customers.  Sometime later this
year, I'll be rolling out something on the Web, but for now, those interested can just send me an e-mail.

The idea that the ISH is of questionable quality is, in my view, rather backwards.  The ISH is a repository of the weather reports by the "official" weather stations around the world, so if you can't trust that, what can you trust?

Dear Joe,

No fair! You  and Dru have been at the forefront energy modeling research for most of my adult life, and have a big head start.

My guess is that you spent a lot of time preparing the actual weather files for the research, however.  Unless I'm missing something, the ready availability of high quality (e.g., no big hunks of missing data) actual weather data has been pretty limited until recently.  With folk like Weather Analytics getting on board and making it pretty easy to get and inexpensive, it becomes a lot faster and lower cost than trying to clean some of the NOAA / NCDC data, not to mention getting good data for sites not in or near a major city.

Kudos for being way ahead of the industry curve (at least my own curve)!  It's getting easier to catch up!

p.s., Dru sent me that paper and I'll be reading it with interest very soon.

I've always thought it was a "no-brainer" to use actual weather data whenever you're comparing simulation results to actual consumption data.  Even with the earliest degree-day software such as
PRISM (Princeton Scorekeeping Method) in the 1980's, it was stressed to use the degree days
from the period of record, and not the long-term average, so I'm not sure why this (using actual
year weather data) is such a revelation.

The variation in total energy consumption of course depends a lot on the building characteristics.
Back in 1996, Dru Crawley and I wrote a paper on "Does it matter which weather data you use in energy simulations?", for the ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings (it also appeared as two
separate ASHRAE papers at around the same time) where we took some prototypical building models (Dru did commercial, I did residential) and ran them with various "typical year" weather files and also 25 years of historical data in 10-12 US locations.

Dear Forums,

I am busy preparing a short talk for the Fall ASHRAE Energy Modeling Conference.  The topic is "An Approach for Calibrating Existing Building Energy Models to their Utility Consumption".

To get a rough idea  how much variation there might be, I looked at Degree Days for a span of years.  What a variation! (for the city I'm studying at least)

I am not yet sure how that affects total energy consumption - you'll have to attend my presentation in Atlanta to find out J.

In the meantime, I am starting to think that existing building energy models should use actual weather, not TMY data.  Have any of you run similar comparisons for existing building models?

eQuest is not really for residential, however DOE2 for residential can be
accessed via the web at this link   http://hespro.lbl.gov/pro/
You could get your values from it to use in or check eQuest with or use it
directly..

Hope this is helpful

In the IBPSA Building Energy Modeling Workshop, we have a few slides on
creating custom weather files, which I have copied below.

If your site has data available, it is not as painful as you use to be to
create a weather file based on actual weather data. See example below. I
have used the weather processing tool that comes with Energy-10 to modify a
TMY files monthly average temperature to match the actual weather year. Of
course it doesn't adjust for solar. But often you don't have the solar data
for the exact site anyway.

Also, RMI has commissioned a software developer to create a visual weather
processing tool to facilitate making custom weather files. It's called
Elements. It's hard to know when it will be realized but a reasonable guess
is Fall 2012. We're alpha testing it now.
