Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE-2 Hourly Information sought
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200307311748.AA4848593pd80000366644@gard.com>

I am trying to ascertain the effect that outside air has on the energy load
of a school. There are 27 air units I am running as SZRH (and they really DO
have reheat coils versus a heating coil).
 
By the way, I input the outside air requirements at the ZONE level (actually
one ZONE corresponds to one SYSTEM).
 
In my perusal of hourly parameters, there really is no specific component
for outside air ANYTHING shown. I have attempted to use the Return Air Temp
and the Mixed Air Temp, along with the fixed Total Supply, Return, and
Outside air volumes to do a mass balance, thus determining the OSA cooling
and heating energy components.
 
But the hourly data shows the Return and Mixed Temperatures almost
identical. Because I put the Outside Air in the ZONE command, is it acting
like Infiltration? Should I be bringing it into the SYSTEM level instead?

DOE-2 functions need to be called at the right spot in the calculation
sequence. Without looking at your function and BDL, it's impossible to tell
what's going on. You can e-mail it to me at YJHuang at lbl.gov and I'll do a

Is there anybody who could give me an indication about my simulation problem?

I am doing simulation on double-glass-facade's feasibility on improve 
building's energy performance. From the data I collected from my mock-up, I 
conducted a function. In DOE 2, I define it as an input function.

Then I input all the data, including geometry,material property, system, 
plant, and my own function. But the output shows me that the function I

Most of the recommendated tools are decades old and not supported any

I believe engineers that really use building energy simulations would

Here are the 10 tools they recommended:

FLEX
LTGSTD ASHRAE 90.1
SuperLight
ProjectKalc
ComCheck-Plus
SkyCalc
Radiance
EQuest
PVWatts
ASEAM

A second opinion in a sidebar by Bion Howard suggested:

Energy-10
EnergyPlus
DOE-2.1 or 2.2
BLAST

I'm interested if the readers of BDLG-SIM would come to the

Hello!

I am looking to find out if anyone has modeled fume hoods for a LEED

I am wondering if 100% of the ventilation is considered process energy
or only part. If only part, what %? Any practical experience would be
greatly

Hey Nikhil,
I would sugeest you take a look at page 5-12of the 90.1 User Manual under 
Air leakage section 5.2.3
It says that all the requirements o f air leakage must be met in both the 
prescriptive and ECB method.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] EQuest (DOE-2.2) Enhancement Funding
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200307211432.AA3216390pd80000357738@gard.com>

I am trying to gain financial support to have some particular enhancements made to the DOE-2.2 engine and EQuest interface supported by JJ Hirsch & Associates.  These include:
1) Metric input and output units
2) Southern hemishpere daylight savings (avoids doubling schedule input)
3) Allowing supply temperature to be passed when using OA-FROM-SYSTEM rather than return temperature only.  This is useful in modelling tempered outdoor air systems for 4-pipe fan coil units or in modelling systems that share a common outdoor air economiser section.
4) Allowing the Induction Unit system supply temperature control to be reset to meet the heating needs of the zone of greatest heating demand.  This is needed to correctly model the heating and reheating (following dehumidification) passive / active chilled beam systems.  Currently you have to control heating on an outdoor reset schedule and you cannot use this to reheat when supply temperature is dropped for dehumidification.

I can gain some financial support from within my company, but require financial support from others to make it happen.  If anyone is interested in supporting some or all of these enhancements and would like to further details or to discuss further please do not hesitate to contact me.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Students need help/  CAD files
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200307151232.AA3224781pd80000353336@gard.com>

Please;

Could any one provide some CAD files for a simple building to be used as an example for my Building Construction students in the Mech. systems class?. I will be grateful if any one may mail or e-mail me a basic design for an open plan factory or retail building with mechanical and electrical layout, I don?t need the structure or the architectural details, It is just the layout of the Arch. Mech., and electrical. If  there is specifications, simulations? calculations, etc. that will be great also. The students will first design the mech. and electrical system, and then will look at the original design. 
43 thanks from the students and me.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200307132239.AA3900203pd80000351926@gard.com>

We're putting together a relatively simple EP file to analyze a central
forced air furnace in residential building. Does anyone have a simple
IDF file that shows how the air loop and associated heating system are
described? Or better yet, if someone has come across a succinct
description of how to build an air loop and air distribution system,
that would be very much appreciated.

Thanks for any help.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200307110821.AA2101687pd80000350243@gard.com>

Hello --

Can anyone give me some leads on software for generation and management of 
batch input files for parametric studies?  I am investigating doing a large 
study using the ASHRAE loads toolkit, so the input files will be of 
home-grown format (not DOE-2).

The one tool that I have found is PREP from Item Systems (www.item.com), 
which looks very promising.  Any experience using PREP?

Any other possibilities?

Thanks!

Chip Barnaby

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200307082259.AA5947125pd80000348385@gard.com>

Hi all,
 
Thanks for the responses on the ASHRAE query. I was able to feed in the right inputs into the eQuest model based on your comments and suggestions. 
 
Continuing on the same topic I had one concern, regarding the budget model for the proposed design. For the Energy Cost Budget calculations two simulations will have to be run, one with the proposed case and the other the budget case based on ASHRAE 90.1 standards. In case of the budget simulation model, ASHRAE 90.1 lists the EER's of the packaged units which includes the fan energy. 
 
When doing the model for the budget case I chose the system types as per the ASHRAE 90.1 selection table. Now I have the EER for the packaged units in my case System 11. But how do I model the fan energy for the budget case. I would have to first determine the CFM for the supply fans and the cooling capacity of the unit. 
 
I tried one approach and I do not know whether it is the right way to go or not.
 
I modeled a Packaged Single Zone system with the ASHRAE 90.1 EER. Assigned a 0 value to the fan energy so that there is no fan energy. and ran the eQuest Model. Then from the SS-P report I used the CFM and cooling capacity calculated by the program to determine the appropriate fan energy. Also in this process I used the ASHRAE 90.1 guideline for the fan HP to be 1.2HP/1000 cfm for  upto 20,000 cfm. So using the cfm reported on the SS-P I calculated the fan HP for the budget case, and using the cooling capacity calculated the EER for the system excluding the fan energy. 
 
Then I plugged in the individual values and ran the simulation model for the budget building.
 
Any suggestions to if this approach is appropriate or not.
 
Thanks
 
Nikhil

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200307071309.AA0921890pd80000347282@gard.com>

Hi,
 
I would appreciate if someone could clarify this question regarding modeling ASHRAE 90.1 modeling in eQuest.
 
ASHRAE 90.1 requires the proposed and the budget design simulation models to have the same fan system efficiency for both the cases. The systems listed in ASHRAE 90.1 provide the total unit efficiencies at ARI conditions. 
 
How does one calculate the fan efficiency to model it separately from the system efficiency in eQuest. 
 
For e.g. for a rooftop packaged unit with an EER of 11.6 how does one know what the EER is without the indoor supply fan energy or alternatively what is the fan energy for the supply fans. 
 
Thanks
 
Nikhil

Dear Dr. Fanny:

This is in response to your inquiry below.  I did not attend the ASHRAE meetings in Kansas City last week so I am waiting for their report also.  I assume it will deal with future priorities and directions for research & developing and upgrading standards.  I believe that ASHRAE has a Chapter in Egypt.  ASHRAE members get handbooks, journals, and newsletters that provide information on energy related work. You will find information on presenting papers for future symposiums and and seminars. Besides BLDG-SIM you can also subscribe to ASHRAE's TC-4.7 Energy Calculations discussion group.  There are several other such discussion groups including one for EnergyPlus and IBPSA. Since I work for an A-E design firm, my interest is mainly in using energy analysis software to show compliance with standards and codes. Below are some web-site addresses that you might be interested in looking at.

Best wishes
