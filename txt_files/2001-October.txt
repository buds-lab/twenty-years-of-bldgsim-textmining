Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Ground Source Heat Pumps in DOE2.1E
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200110080940.AA400232pd80000115990@gard.com>

I recently noticed the option for simulating ground source heat pumps in
DOE-2.1E (ref. DOE-2.1E Update Package #1, Page 3).

It adds the option of setting HP-LOOP-HEATING and HP-LOOP-COOLING source
under PLANT-ASSIGNMENT to FROM-GROUND. The new keyword GLOOP-TEMP-SCH
accepts a schedule of ground temperatures in F with a default of the weather
file ground temperatures.

Has anyone had any experience with using these keywords, or modeling ground
source heat pump in DOE-2.1E? I couldn't find any other documentation for
this. Are there other keyword specifying the properties of the GLOOP?

Thanks,

Tanmay Tathagat

Can anyone let me know whether there is a tool to convert a TMY2 weather
file to DOE-2 weather file?

Thanks

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] daylight control with roof windows
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200110220257.AA570350pd80000085303@gard.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to simulate a building, which has windows in the roof. I would like to take those windows in account. The reason why is because there aren't any other windows in the building, and I would like to do a daylight control of the light in the room. Is there any solution to that problem. In a first order solution, I 've put a estimation of the power generated into the EPD, but that involves no daylight control.

Thanks

Is anyone aware of where I can get hold of a guide specification for a
photovoltaic system - Section 13650 - to include in a set of construction
documents?
