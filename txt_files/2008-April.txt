As far as I know you cannot do it in DOE2 directly, but a quasi DOE2
approach would be to calculate the hourly system loads using DOE2 and
calculate VRV energy consumption using spreadsheet calculations. You will
have to create a regression based model to calculate the energy consumption
as a function of the capacity and outdoor air temperature (The data is
available on Mr. Slim website). Once you are sure the model is working
correctly (be sure to put limits on your equations for out of range data)
you can use the hourly weather boundary conditions to calculate the annual
energy consumption.

If  you are doing code compliance using eQUEST you can calculate the average
calibrated EER using the above methodology and use it as a DOE2 input.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energy Design Plugin public beta release now available
Message-ID: <C468F8F9013C3440B9DCC8273A8FE13F0AC96213@mail-1a.nrel.gov>

Please excuse the cross-postings...

 

 

Energy Design Plugin public beta release now available

 

DOE and NREL are pleased to announce the public beta release of the
Energy Design Plugin--an EnergyPlus plugin for Google SketchUp.  

 

The plugin can be downloaded for free from the EnergyPlus web site at:

http://www.energyplus.gov/energy_design_plugin.html

 

 

The plugin makes it easy to create and edit the building geometry in
your EnergyPlus input files.  The plugin also allows you to launch
EnergyPlus simulations and view the results without leaving SketchUp.

 

Designed to integrate seamlessly with the SketchUp environment, the
plugin allows you to use the standard SketchUp tools to create and edit
EnergyPlus zones and surfaces.  You can explore your EnergyPlus input
files by using all of the native SketchUp 3D capabilities to view the
geometry from any vantage point, apply different rendering styles, and
perform accurate shadowing studies.  The plugin allows you to mix
EnergyPlus simulation content with decorative content such as background
images, landscaping, people, and architectural finish details-all within
the same SketchUp model.

 

The plugin adds the building energy simulation capabilities of
EnergyPlus to the SketchUp environment.  You can launch an EnergyPlus
simulation of the model you are working on and view the results without
leaving SketchUp.

 

Highlights of the beta version of the Energy Design Plugin include:

 

* The ability to create and edit EnergyPlus zones and surfaces 

* The ability to launch EnergyPlus and view the results without leaving
SketchUp

 

This plugin makes it easier to work with EnergyPlus.  However, expertise
in using EnergyPlus at the text level is highly recommended for
performing successful and accurate simulations.  The beta version of the
plugin does not yet handle all critical input objects.  Some editing of
the input file will usually be required outside of SketchUp.

 

After installing, the help files should get you started.  You might also
try opening some of the input files that are included in the Examples
directory to help get your feet wet.  If you have any problems, please
contact me at the support email:  energy_design_plugin at nrel.gov  I would
really appreciate any bug reports, suggestions, or other feedback from
you.  

 

Thanks!

Peter Ellis

Message-ID: <DB3AAEF34B744F4F9634B1B6FAEBFAB22C15DF@fkusa-lvexchange.FKUSA.ORG>

I have recently duplicated a system to be able to apply a individual
system per zone. When I run the model it informs me that I have 100 bad
building components but it doesn't generate a .sim file or a bdl error
report so I have now idea where the bad components are to fix them.

 

Before I duplicated the systems the model would run and before I
duplicated the systems for every floor I trialed the duplication on one
floor and it would run.

 

Has anyone got any ideas on what the problem could be?

Hey everyone.  Thank you for the help so far.  My current question is
regarding the Heating via DX coils with a ground loop.  I have run every
eQuest model successfully with other systems (even the other DX coil
options), but every time the ground loop causes my eQuest model to crash.
Literally, the program shuts down each time I choose the DX Coils ground
loop as my heat source and run the building simulation.  I would really like
to see what the loads look like for this system.  Any thoughts??

 

Thanks!

Hi there-
 
Curious if anyone out there knows anything about the chiller EIR-fPLR
curve that is inserted by default in eQuest, when a user selects a
variable frequency drive compressor?  Most of the time, the EIR-fPLR
curve is a quadratic curve based only on the PLR, but this curve is
biquadratic, with another term called dt.  Can anyone enlighten me on
which dt they are talking about here?  I can't find it in the
documentation.

Andrew:
 
Could you please describe your problem more specifically? What do you mean "choose the DX Coils ground loop as my heat source"? Do you mean selecting the source for heat pump in the wizard? A reminder is, eQUEST/DOE-2.2 does not automatically size GHX and the default may be only good for light commercial building. The default GHX may be too small for large building, which will result in unrealistic high/low temperature and crash of the program.

Xiaobing

Andrew,

 

My experience with eQUEST version 3.61 also entailed a program crash
(or, more accurately an endless loop of error prompts requiring me to
force the program to quit) when I attempted to add a ground loop to my
model.

 

The only solution I know of is to create a copy of the model you are
working on, and then shift over to a different build version of eQUEST
that doesn't have this bug. I cannot recall which version I ended up
using that made it work, but there are several in the download area on
the DOE-2 website to try from. Just remember to save a copy of your
model before doing this.

 

Hopefully this should help!

It's the differential between the entering condenser water temperature and
the leaving chilled water temperature.

 

Savings for chillers with VFDs are dependent on the pressure rise the
impellor must overcome.  Maximum savings accrue if the dT is low when the
load is low.  If the cooling tower is running warm when the load is low,
then the impellor may have to run at close to full speed to produce the
required pressure rise and avoid surge.  The dT term takes that effect into
account.

A quasi DOE2 approach would be to calculate the hourly system loads using
DOE2 and calculate VRV energy consumption using spreadsheet calculations.
You will have to create a regression based model to calculate the energy
consumption as a function of the capacity and outdoor air temperature (The
data is available on Mr. Slim website). Once you are sure the model is
working correctly (be sure to put limits on your equations for out of range
data) you can use the hourly weather boundary conditions to calculate the
annual energy consumption.

If  you are doing code compliance using eQUEST you can calculate the average
calibrated EER using the above methodology and use it as a DOE2 input.

Hi Graham,

FYI, the new version of IDA ICE, which is currently in beta testing, has a
complete implementation of the ISO 15099 multi pane window model. This makes
it possible to model window and blind combinations from first principles as
you desire.

Best regards,

Graham,

 

You can, within IES Virtual Environment, explicitly model blinds as you have described below: 

 

First either divide the vented fa?ade into two zones (inner and outer air spaces) with a corrugated surface or add such a partition to one zone; every other facet of this corrugated surface will be a blind slat with specified material properties and tilt angle, etc., and the facets in between will be holes. Having completed this, if you made two zones to begin with, then combine them as one zone with the blinds as floating partition or planar surface elements. If you need to model the fa?ade over the course of a year with the louvers at dynamically varied angles or in various states of deployment, I?d suggest multiple runs with post-processing to combine the data into a single year. For this you would combine selected results based upon incident solar gain for that hour, or whatever variable you choose to determine the control of the louver angles, etc.

 

It is important that you end up with a single combined zone between the inner and outer glazing to ensure proper calculation of transmitted direct and diffuse solar gain (however, you will still require separate vertically stacked zones for each story, etc. of the building fa?ade as means of determining differences in buoyancy with MacroFlo). The thermal properties of the blind materials and their surfaces will also be important to determining the absorbed solar gain, re-radiation to the fa?ade elements, and convective heat transfer to the air in the vented cavity. Lastly, because the theory applied in MacroFlo is based on the flow characteristics of openings that are small in relation to the spaces they connect?i.e., it?s set up to account for the flow resistance (aero drag coefficient) of operable windows, other punched openings, etc.?you will need to have a look at Section 7: Techniques for Modeling Flow in Fa?ades and Flues in the MacroFlo Calculation Methods section of the user manual. This will tell you how to adjust the dimensions of your fa?ade cavity model so that a MacroFlo opening at each floor height (or similar) will appropriately account for resistance from openings, mullion protrusions, catwalks, surface friction, and so forth.

Hi all,

We are revisiting ventilated facades with cavity blinds in an attempt to minimise the fabric heat loads on a building.  We are looking at internally and externally ventilated options.  My experience in this area is limited to use of bulk airflow modelling (IES Apache or use of Arup's in house tools during the time I worked for them).

 

We have done some preliminary digging around to source the best software to determine average annual performance, bulk temperatures etc recognising that CFD will always have a place in understanding airflows and temperatures in more detail.  Our current position is:

1) We explored the possibilities with Energy+ and the ventilated facade / cavity model 2-3 years ago and were unable to generate results that we had confidence in.  In skimming the version updates it does not appear that there has been further work on this module so we don't plan to go back to Energy+.

2) We use IES Apache extensively but the blind inputs are indirect (unknown) rather than direct (known) properties and thus lead to uncertainty (see below)

3) We were initially encouraged by the ICE software out of Sweden, but now understand that the blind inputs are similar to IES.

 

IES / ICE take as input for the blind the a SHGC modifier (1 - SHGC = the overall reflected component of the blind be it SW or LW radiation) along with the proportion of this which ends up as shortwave versus longwave radiation.  There is also a U-Value / conductance modifier.  The blind can be incident solar or time controlled like most programs.

 

We would prefer to input blind transmittance and absorptance (or reflectance) and let the software dynamically determine SHGC.  Until you have an understanding of the temperature of the blind which is a function of incident solar radiation, ambient temperatures, cavity ariflow etc you won't know exactly what the longwave radiation component is of the SHGC.  So the egg comes before the chicken ... .  

 

In short the longwave component of the blind SHGC is a strong function of other dynamic or design variables and as such cannot be pre-determined with confidence in our professional opinion.

 

Does TRNSYS or other overcome this limitation?  

 

Any suggestions? Any killer papers out there that have correlated longwave blind SHGC to different glazing & blind types and ventilation arrangements? for a variety of solar / ambient conditions ..... ?  Anyone considering a PhD in the near future in this area :)?

Graham

All,
 
It is my understanding that Mitsubishi and Daikan funded development of
DOE2 VRF routines that run under EnergyPro and VisualDOE using DOE2.1E,
and there may be some problematic challenges
<http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2007-Au
gust/006284.html>  hindering simple implementation in eQuest.
. 
Will see if I can elicit comment on this topic from eQuest's dynamic,
talented and decidedly underappreciated developers, who tirelessly toil
day and night on our behalf.  Perhaps we can show our appreciation for
them by all lobbying our local Mitsubishi / Daikan reps to secure
funding for a port-to-eQuest effort.  After all, updating to eQuest it
seems would be in the manufacture's best interests, with usage of
variable refrigerant flow systems gaining traction in the marketplace.
 
As a short-term workaround, am following up on a rumor that there may be
a way for an eQuest parametric run to be manually edited to reference
these routines, provided they can be obtained.  Will also see what I can
do about actually obtaining them.  This isn't a purely altruistic
gesture, I too am working on a VRF system.
 
More information forthcoming, hopefully...

Dear Sasa,

 

I think the first place to start asking will be Dubai Metrological Office (link below). I have used some of the theoretical models with very good results for the UK climate and similar work has been done by some researchers to validate a model by Kenneth Labs in the climate Kuwait which I guess is similar to that of Dubai. In the absence of measured data, these models give accuracy of about ?1K, when the input parameters are estimated accurately.  Find below 3 references that may give you further info with regards the model and its application in Kuwait.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Info about soil temperature

 

Dear coleagues,

 

I would kindly ask for an information please.

Does anyone know where I could find measured soil temperatures at depths
of 1,2,3 meters in Dubai, UAE.  I have found various theoretical models
from the literature and some on the web such as:

 

http://soilphysics.okstate.edu/toolkit/temperature/index0.html

 

Please advise!

Kind regards, Sasa

Hello, 

 

Does anybody have success modeling a ground-to-air heat exchanger in
eQuest?

 

The ground-to-air heat exchanger is a network of underground pipes aimed
at preheating / pre-cooling the outdoor air.

 

Any suggestions for modeling this system?

 

Thanks.

Message-ID: <FD0241DFB8AE82489426887DFCA625A2DA73E6@CD1001-M220.corp.ads>

Our office is modeling a particular project in Castlegar BC using eQuest.
Unfortunately Castlegar is not one of the few Canadian built-in regions, nor is it really effectively represented by one of the built-in regions.
Where can one obtain bin data for the various "other" regions? 
Or, how can one create bin data for a particular region? 
Does anyone have any references for what the structure of a bin file is or what the process is for encoding the data? 
 
As a minor aside,
I had a look in EE4 and Castlegar BC is a built-in region, however a more in-depth look shows that when Castlegar is selected EE4 refers to the Summerland BC bin data.
In this instance does EE4 make any changes to the Summerland data to better reflect Castlegar? 
It was my hope that if I could find a bin file for Castlegar in EE4 I could use that file in eQuest.
Would the files be interchangeable?  
 
Your input is greatly appreciated,

To answer your aside, yes the EE4 .bin files are interchangeable with 
eQUEST .bin files.  However, EE4 does not modify the Summerland data 
when running it for Castlegar -- it is just the closest weather set in 
the 43 Canadian CWEC sites. 

If you can obtain hourly weather data for Castlegar, there is a weather 
processor which will convert it from a pre-formated text file (a .FT 
file) into a binary .bin weather file.  The trick is getting the data 
for Castlegar.  I am not aware of any data closer than Summerland.  
Attached is the weather processor manual which describes the formate of 
the text file and the data you will need to obtain.

Good luck.

Sloped grade needs to be modeled in detailed data edit,  create a polygon
that takes the shape of the above grade portion and a separate polygon for
the below grade portion.  Then you may add an exterior wall to the
appropriate vertex and enter x,y,z coordinates to properly place.  Likewise,
this may be done with the below grade wall by creating an underground wall.
Be aware when you convert your model from the wizards to detailed data edit,
there is no going back to the wizards.

Dear All,

We're looking at using shading (overhangs on windows to the south)
integrated with PV for a commercial project. The current product we're
looking at seems very  low on efficiency due to the density of the solar
cells on the shading surface. Can you suggest a product you've worked with
and consider worth recommending?

Any opinions/experiences on using products ready for use Vs custom designing
such a system?

Thanks,

All,
RE: ASHRAE 90.1, App G, Article G.4.2.3.1.2, Supply Air Reset

Addendum A revised this article to say: "The air temperature for cooling shall be rest higher by 5F under the minimum cooling load conditions".
This sounds to me like they are saying the supply air temperature should be reset based on outdoor air temperature.  This would be quite a change in concept from the original version of this article which required the supply air temperature to be reset based zone demand.

Are others out there interpretting the revised addendum A version of this article the same way I am....i.e. that the SAT should now be reset based on outdoor air temperature?  Or, are people still interpretting it as the SAT should be reset based on zone demand?

Would appreciate any feedback anyone has on this, especially with respect to doing a LEED energy model.

Has anyone modeled a baseline building in Dubai for LEED, complying with 
ASHRAE 90.1?  I'm wondering how to match the glazing properties.  ASHRAE 
lists a SHGC and a U-value, but IES asks for transmittance, reflectances, 
and the refractive index. 

What is the best way to model glazing to meet the ASHRAE requirements?

I would interpret that as by zone demand, since you will have both internal and external gains figured in to the "minimum cooling load conditions".  There could be instances where the outdoor air temperature is relatively low, but your solar load in conjunction with the internal heat gains may be high, so a straight outdoor air reset wouldn't work.
 
My thoughts.

eQUEST doesn't allow you to directly model earth tubes.  Depending on your
level of eQUEST skill you can make some thermodynamic approximations of how
the earth tubes will effect your annual energy use if you first perform some
external calculations to estimate the performance of the tubes based on
their proposed design (ie: how will the earth tubes impact the entering
outdoor air temperature you see at each air-handling system).
 
I believe that other simulation programs have the capability to directly
simulate earth tubes which I recommend you investigate.

I'd interpret it as either. But now with "zone demand," (DOE2 "WARMEST") one can meet the intent of the PRM baseline and model a maximum RA humidity setpoint that resets the SAT back down when sensible gains are low, but OA is moist.

I would interpret that as by zone demand, since you will have both internal and external gains figured in to the "minimum cooling load conditions".  There could be instances where the outdoor air temperature is relatively low, but your solar load in conjunction with the internal heat gains may be high, so a straight outdoor air reset wouldn't work.

All,
RE: ASHRAE 90.1, App G, Article G.4.2.3.1.2, Supply Air Reset
 
Addendum A revised this article to say: "The air temperature for cooling shall be rest higher by 5F under the minimum cooling load conditions".
This sounds to me like they are saying the supply air temperature should be reset based on outdoor air temperature.  This would be quite a change in concept from the original version of this article which required the supply air temperature to be reset based zone demand.
 
Are others out there interpretting the revised addendum A version of this article the same way I am....i.e. that the SAT should now be reset based on outdoor air temperature?  Or, are people still interpretting it as the SAT should be reset based on zone demand?
 
Would appreciate any feedback anyone has on this, especially with respect to doing a LEED energy model.
Thanks.

Message-ID: <864490.69769.qm@web45104.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

Thanks for the input.
Now for a follow on question.  I use Trace.  Trace can model zone demand supply air temp reset very easily.  However, does anyone know how to put the ASHRAE 90.1, App G, allowable limit of 5F reset into Trace.

What I'm finding is that the supply air temp reset drastically improves the performance of both my proposed and baseline models.  The 5F ASHRAE reset criteria would seem to help me limit the improvement in my baseline model which would be good with respect my proposed bldg's performance.

Again, thanks for any feedback or insight out there.

Message-ID: <991382.31018.qm@web51512.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

What I have previously to model earth-tubes is to
manipulate the weather file that is going in eQUEST.
In my case it was pretty straight forward because the
space being served was internal so there was no heat
transfer from external walls. Hence I was able to use
this method.

1) Modeled the air temperature coming out of an earth
duct in TRNSYS. TRNSYS has ground-air HX types but
also a specific type( Type 260 developed by
Hollmuller) that can model earth ducts. 

2) I then manually modified a tmy2 file for the
location and replaced the dry-bulb, RH and dew-point
with the properties of the air coming out of the tube.

3) Converted the TMY2 files to DOE-2 weather file.

Again, I had to do this because we were evaluating the
total energy savings of an earth duct for
preconditioning. Modifying weather files is definitely
not recommended if the building or space sees outside
conditions.


Hope this helps.

Subject: DOE eQUEST question


Hello! I found this mailing list while searching for eQUEST FAQ/Help/Email address to send bugs to. I am trying to model a building that will be located inside a hangar (enclosed on all sides but one). Two questions thus far that someone out there hopefully knows the answer to:

1) Is there a way to say "no exposure" for exterior walls like the option for roofs?

2) I have three demand blocks for Electric Utility Charges (screen 4/7 on Project and Site Data Wizard) - it let me add blocks once but I deleted them by accident and now it won't let me add blocks. If I select "Second Season" and try to add demand blocks there, it lets me. 

Also on demand blocks, mine are 

1st 500 kw - $9/kw
next 100 kw - $9.32/kw
over 1500 kw - $8.34/kw

Would the correct way to define this in eQUEST be to set block sizes at 500, 100, and 1500 and the $/kW at the respective values above? The Help section in eQUEST isn't clear on this point.

3) What is the difference between the Wizard and the "detailed interface"? Is the detailed interface just the other things you can click (EE measure wizard, simulate building performance, etc) under the "building creation wizard button"? If not, how do I access the "detailed interface" and what is it used for?

Thank you in advance for any assistance. 

Kim

Hi, 

 

What is your approach of modeling trombe walls in eQuest.

Someone in the archives suggested defining an exterior wall assembly
with spandrel glass/air gap/mass wall.

In my model, the effects of doing so are negligible.

 

Suggestions, suggestions ....

Thanks for your input.

Demba,
I tried to model Trombe Walls for a project I was doing in Asheville, NC
in eQUEST. like you, I drew a blank. There are a couple of things you
could use:
 
1. SunREL - a software program developed at NREL for passive solar.
2. You could also perform hand calculations based on the LSR/SSF method 
3. Our office worked with Penn State to optimize the Trombe Walls and
other aspects of the building using CFD.
 
Good luck

Welcome to the list.  Note that there is an archive of list postings 
which may be helpful.

Item 1) simply delete wall -- if it is not there, DOE-2 accounts for no 
heat transfer, solar effect etc for that surface.  You will have to 
delete it in the detailed interface (see item 3).

Item 2)  your demand blocks are "cumulative".  You can either enter 
these blocks as "cumulative" or 500, 600, 2100 kW "incremental".  Not 
sure why they cannot be reentered.  You could always enter them in 
detailed interface. 

Item 3) the Wizard interface is a quick way to first build a model.  In 
the detailed interface, you can edit each of the DOE keywords and edit 
the model in much (much!) greater detail.  After you hit "finish", you 
change from wizard to detailed under "Mode" in the menu bar. 

I would recommend running through the eQUEST tutorial.  I would also 
recommend you have a look at the Modeling Procedures Quick Reference -- 
you can find it by "right-clicking" on any eQUEST field and select 
"Tutorial and Reference" and pick it off the list.

Good luck.

Hello

 

Does anyone know how to turn off the air-side economizers in eQuest?  I
am trying to simulate early 90's office buildings.

 

Thanks in advance!

All,
 
It is my understanding that Mitsubishi and Daikan funded development of
DOE2 VRF routines that run under EnergyPro and VisualDOE using DOE2.1E,
and there may be some problematic challenges
<http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2007-Au
gust/006284.html>  hindering simple implementation in eQuest.
. 
Will see if I can elicit comment on this topic from eQuest's dynamic,
talented and decidedly underappreciated developers, who tirelessly toil
day and night on our behalf.  Perhaps we can show our appreciation for
them by all lobbying our local Mitsubishi / Daikan reps to secure
funding for a port-to-eQuest effort.  After all, updating to eQuest it
seems would be in the manufacture's best interests, with usage of
variable refrigerant flow systems gaining traction in the marketplace.
 
As a short-term workaround, am following up on a rumor that there may be
a way for an eQuest parametric run to be manually edited to reference
these routines, provided they can be obtained.  Will also see what I can
do about actually obtaining them.  This isn't a purely altruistic
gesture, I too am working on a VRF system.
 
More information forthcoming, hopefully...

As far as I know you cannot do it in DOE2 directly, but a quasi DOE2
approach would be to calculate the hourly system loads using DOE2 and
calculate VRV energy consumption using spreadsheet calculations. You
will have to create a regression based model to calculate the energy
consumption as a function of the capacity and outdoor air temperature
(The data is available on Mr. Slim website). Once you are sure the model
is working correctly (be sure to put limits on your equations for out of
range data) you can use the hourly weather boundary conditions to
calculate the annual energy consumption. 
 
If  you are doing code compliance using eQUEST you can calculate the
average calibrated EER using the above methodology and use it as a DOE2
input.

Hello,

I am working on an energy model using equest and I am trying to find out
a way to decrease the ventilation fan electrical consumption of my
building.  The problem is I am not sure what exactly determines that
calculation, so I would be appreciative if someone could explain that to
me.

All,
I am modeling a library that has a mix of air-cooled roof top units and
water-cooled packaged AC units with a cooling tower.  Based on floors,
square footage, and heating type, it falls under ASHRAE App-G baseline
system 5.

My question: Should the baseline systems be all air cooled? Or should it
match the proposed system, including both air cooled units and water
cooled units with a cooling tower? 

Thanks for your input,

Sam

Message-ID: <48506176BF20D547B9BE5CBD7C426678038846D6@fkusa-exchange>

To All,

 

Does anyone know if we are allowed to take credit for shading from
existing adjacent buildings that are not part of the project being
submitted for LEED NC accreditation? 

 

I know there has been discussion regarding self-shading and that the
90.1-2004 User's Manual states: " If the proposed building has a shape
that shades itself during portions of the day, for instance a donut or
"L" shaped building, the self-shading is ignored in the baseline
building.  Such features are credited to the proposed building when they
are a benefit."  Also App G states "The [baseline] building shall be
modeled so that it does not shade itself." 

 

>From the intent of those statements, it seems as if we should be allowed
to model the baseline building without shading from adjacent buildings
and the proposed building with shading from adjacent buildings.  

 

Any opinions and or experience with this issue would be appreciated

 

Thank you very much

Linda

Ali,

 

Unfortunately there is not a way to save modifications made in the
detail edit mode in eQUEST when you go back to a wizard. It's one of the
drawbacks of the program. I have gotten into the habit of making a list
of the changes that I have made in the detail edit mode so that if
(when) I need to go back into the wizard, I can retrace my steps rather
quickly without missing something.

Hello everybody!

My name is Maria Soldatti, an Mechanical Engineer, and I need know:

Where can I find the compliance rule processor? I need to incorporate the
different energy code compliance rules, but I cannot find instructions in
the document  "DOE22Vol5-ComplianceAnalysis.pdf. Also, I cannot find the
program D2RulCmp.exe.
Any information will be greated.

The one thing I have been able to do when forced back to the Wizard 
after making detailed interface modifications, is to save some of the 
modifications (especially HVAC system modifications such as plant 
definitions and ventilation systems) by extracting them from the .inp 
file in a partial .inp and then importing that .inp Once I am done with 
the Wizard and back in the detailed interface.

Note that you can edit the .inp directly and any changes will be 
reflected in the eQUEST interface. This is both helpful and dangerous. 
You can use a text editor to "search & replace" -- "EL1_" for example. 
(Make sure you back up first!!!)

Cheers,

Brian

Message-ID: <F8394E9839E76C44AE7D789C1B8FBB4F09D7B424@norexchange.noresco.com>

Dear colleagues,

I am attempting to model my building's hot water system, however, my
skills and knowledge about equest is limited. Any guidance would be
greatly appreciated.

The hot water system consists of 6 modular boilers with individual
primary loop pumps and a VFD operated hot water distribution pump. The
modular boilers are sequenced by the DDC system to maintain the heating
water supply temperature at the hot water set point. When the hot water
supply temperature falls below the supply set point, the DDC system will
index an additional boiler on. Similarly, the DDC will turn boilers off
as needed. Can this set up be modeled in eQuest? And if so, what needs
to be done to model these controls?

I am aware equest only allows 2 boilers to be modeled; the control
aspects of this example is what I'm stumped on.
Thank you in advance for your help,

My understanding is that both Mitsubishi and Daikin worked with Martin Dodd (from EnergySoft) on the VRF/VFRZ routines. 

As such, for California users of EnergyPro (EnergySoft's program) can download the VRF/VFRZ routines. There are libraries for Mitsubishi and Daikin.

We've done some preliminary runs with them in our office with them.

Thanks Kim and all who replied!



If shading from adjacent buildings prevents us from receiving credit for
PV panels and daylighting, we should be able to get credit for heat gain
reduction. 

 

I think we are submitting a CIR for this...

Hi Linda,

 

Since you asked for opinions, here is my 2 cents:

 

With the self-shading, the building could be designed such that there is
no self-shading OR it could be designed such that there is. So, because
both are possibilities you are allowed to take credit for self-shading
because you chose a more efficient building design.

 

With existing adjacent buildings, it is quite possible that any building
you design will be shaded. Thus, it does not make sense to be able to
take credit for this because any baseline building would also be shaded
- the building shading is constant. On the other hand, if part of the
lot you are building on is un-shaded by adjacent buildings and you have
a choice between placing the building in the shadow of the adjacent
buildings or placing it outside the shadow, then I would say you could
take the credit.

 

Perhaps this would make a good CIR.

Hi all,



I am a new user of the software E-QUEST and I was trying to do one of the
examples which appears in the help,



*"EXAMPLE 4. THERMAL TRACKING WITH SURPLUS SALE"*



The idea is to model a trigeneration system and I think that i should learn
properly the equipment control from E-QUEST.



Has anyone made that example? Is it correct? I don?t understand the inputs
for "heating-Ctrl".





On the other hands, if somebody knows another easy way to model the system,
it is welcome.



Thanks in advance,



Regards,



Francisco

Christopher,
 
Check out 'Meters' in the DOE2 documentation...it sounds like you are
looking to meter the chilled water plant separately from the building.
If so, its fairly simple to do, as well as applying separate rate
schedule to the plant.

The volumetric flow rates and static pressures of your supply and
return/exhaust fans are the direct contributors to fan energy
consumption; motor and fan efficiencies will contribute indirectly.

Message-ID: <47FD3661.4060704@sustainablybuilt.com>

Sorry if this is a repost, but I didn't see the item show up in the 
daily digest. Any help on this item would be much appreciated.

---------
I'm looking for help in how to correctly specify an ERV for a
residential application. Unfortunately, the two available HVAC systems
in Equest for residential do not support an ERV. I'm afraid if I choose
any of the other commercial based systems that the fan loads, internal
gains and the rest will be very inaccurate.

Does anyone have much experience with modeling HVAC systems for
residential buildings? Even more tricky is that I'm doing this on a
single family home, not multifamily, which seems to be all that Equest
can really support. Are there other hourly simulation tools that could
properly handle an ERV for residential?

Please cc a reply to my email address as well: adam at sustainablybuilt.com

Thanks for any advice!

Message-ID: <15275.21242.qm@web56412.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Hello,
I am trying to?model the thermal mass of two structures in eQUEST.? One is a massive structure (i.e. concrete walls) and the other is a light weight structure (i.e.?wood frame). Otherwise the systems are identical.
I have read the old post from Jeff?Harberl regarding this topic, but was wondering if anyone could provide further assistance.
My models thus far:
-have u-factors?specified (layers input is ON)
-custom weighting factors are being used (floor weight?= 0)
Under CONSTRUCTION Summary the graph of 'Heat Transfer From Outside to Inside' reflects?the delayed thermal mass effect for my massive wall and no thermal mass effect (immediate heat gain) for the light wall.
However, when I look at the results I don't see the?effects expected.??There seems to be no influence on Electricity?Consumption (i.e. Space Cooling) nor does the Monthly Electric Peak?Day Load Profile so a?'delayed' effect.
I am wonder if this is where? I need to apply the Jeff's mention of 'effective' parameters, but I don't see where I would do this or how.
If anyone has a suggestion or can see where I am missing something, the help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks
John Anderson
ps. I have tried changing other variables (building location- hot/cold climate, % windows, etc.), but this hasn't?resolved the issue.?

Ground Source Heat Pump - heating modeDear colleague:

      I have met a serious problem during LEED a factory.
        
      For this project, There equipped some HL-600G&HL-600 Gravity type skylight ventilator on the factory roof and some operable window at the surrounding walls. But the height of the ventilator is from 10.5m to 13m over the ground surface.

            LEED/ASHRAE 62 requirment: Natural ventilation spaces shall be permanently open to and within 8m of operable wall or roof opening to the outdoors.   

           Assume the breathing zone is 1.6m high, So LEED accept height of the ventilator should be lower than 9.6(1.6+8)m. So the interior area(more than 8 m away from surrounding walls) does not have valid natural ventalition system as described by LEED/ASHRAE.

     
           The designer does not agree our opinion, their reason:

1.    the design is to give comfort to the operators on the floor since the process equipment is very hot and the space within the 8-m high will get unbearably hot.  Nanjing is known for its hot summers
2.    the specification is for 22 air changes per hour (ACPH) and the need for 8-m floor to roof eave height is to aid natural draught ventilation so it is easier to reach 22 ACPH
3.    The supplier is to warrant 22 ACPH and provide ASHRAE calculations to reach this figure.
4.    It is less acceptable to fill the roof area with mechanical roof ventilators since it is energy dependent (an increase in the carbon footprint) and as such agaist the LEED concept
5.    The approach is within the philosophy of LEED in that the operators comfort and well being is at the heart of this design, the use on natural ventilation address sustainable design in that no energy is required to get 22 ACPH.

    QUESTION:  1. Are the designers reason will be agreed by LEED?

                2.  If we installed some exhaust fan on the roof, makeup air will go in through operable windows on the surrounding walls. whether the ventalition system changed to mechanical ventalition system as defined by ASHRAE/LEED?

 Any further suggestion is highly appreciated.

For EQ Credit 2, LEED also states that you can use a "macroscopic multi-zone
analytic model" to prove that your natural ventilation design will provide
the minimal outdoor air flow rates stipulated for mechanical ventilation
systems in ASHRAE 62.  I have used CONTAM to do this for another project.

Dear Colleagues,

Can anyone offer guidance on how to model controls for an air handler?
I'd like the model to cycle 100% return air at night, keeping the
exhaust fans off and the outside air dampers closed.
Thank you in advance,

Matthew-

I'm not sure what you mean by going haywire.  But when you create parametric
runs, eQuest will create new input and simulation files for each of these.
They will be located in the project folder.  Hope that helps.

You may be trying to open the summary parametric reports (at the bottom 
of the report list) without having successfully run multiple parametric 
runs -- eQUEST doesn't like this much and the report screen will flash 
at you for a bit before advising that report info is not found.

Dear all,

While trying to analyze the energy performance of an existing building that
does not have sub metering for different end uses, is there an accepted way
of evaluating the effect of various energy efficiency measures via an energy
model? (so as to recommend those EEMs that have a greater impact).

Thanks,

Ramana-

You would simply run the model with the EEM in place and then run another
model without the EEM.

All-

I am modeling a building that would be charged large penalties for peak day
utility demand.  We have been toying with the idea of using an ice storage
plant to reduce this ratchet penalty.  Does anyone have experience modeling
this?  I have been running into a few problems, one of them with correctly
sizing the charge and discharge loops.  Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Hello Ramana,
   
   I do not have direct answer but perhaps I might direct you where to look for (http://www.solardecathlon.de/index.php/press-room/kontakt/) or perhaps try considering different approach where PV cells are installed onto shutters 
   http://www.solardecathlon.de/index.php/our-house/the-shell/
   
  German team won Solar Decathlon competition in 2007 by combining  passive house design techniques + PV shutters.
   
  Hope this might help.
  Thanks, Sasa
   
  P.S. My appologies for cross posting!

  Dear All,

We're looking at using shading (overhangs on windows to the south) integrated with PV for a commercial project. The current product we're looking at seems very  low on efficiency due to the density of the solar cells on the shading surface. Can you suggest a product you've worked with and consider worth recommending?

Any opinions/experiences on using products ready for use Vs custom designing such a system?

Message-ID: <4804B251.5030503@esru.strath.ac.uk>

Building Simulation 2009
University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland
27th -- 30th July

Call for abstracts for BS'09

Conference website: www.bs2009.org.uk

Abstracts may be submitted via our website above. Please note that the 
deadline for abstracts is *1 September 2008*.

*IBPSA* will hold its 11th bi-annual international conference, the 
leading international conference in building performance simulation, in 
summer 2009 at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. Glasgow, 
Scotland's largest city, has an unrivalled choice of museums, theatres, 
parks, science centre and shopping, set within some of the finest 
Victorian architecture in Europe. In addition, Glasgow has a worldwide 
reputation as a welcoming city and is firmly established and experienced 
as a major centre for conferences and international events.

The conference organizers are seeking high quality papers and will limit 
the number of peer-reviewed oral presentations. Submissions will 
therefore be rigorously peer-reviewed. Simulation-based papers on the 
following themes are welcomed:

   1. advances in building physics
   2. human aspects of the indoor environment
   3. building services
   4. commissioning and operation
   5. energy capture and conversion
   6. advances in applications
   7. validation and calibration
   8. software issues
   9. simulation in design practice
  10. regulation/code compliance
  11. application day case studies*

* One day of the conference will be devoted to practical applications, 
particularly focusing on simulation in practice with illustrative case 
studies. Therefore, a limited number of additional papers are invited in 
order to enable practitioners to demonstrate the benefits flowing from 
the recent upsurge in the use of simulation in building design. If you 
wish to contribute such a paper, please ensure it is marked as an 
application day case study in the abstract submission.

Abstracts should be in plain text and no more than 500 words. They 
should describe clearly the research objectives and new knowledge 
arising from the research.

*Key Dates*
September 1st 2008 	Abstracts due
November 1st 2008 	Abstract acceptance
February 1st 2009 	Full papers due
April 1st 2009 	Paper reviews provided to authors
April 15th 2009 	Deadline for revised paper
April 22nd 2009 	Deadline for final formatted papers
May 1st 2009 	Final acceptance notification
May 15th 2009 	Deadline for conference pre-registration
July 27th -- 30th 2009 	BS '09 Conference


Accommodation, both convenient hotels and student apartments, can be 
booked through the conference website www.bs2009.org.uk.

Student support will again be available - details will be announced 
later on the website.

We look forward to welcoming you to Glasgow and are sure you will enjoy 
the experience.

As eQUEST does not currently support SI units, what energy simulation
programs are typically used in European countries? Are there other
programs used besides IES-VE, Ecotect and ESP-r that support SI units.
Do any of these programs combine heating and cooling load calculation
with energy simulation like Trane Trace 700? Which programs support 3-D

Mark,
 
We use Trnsys here at Transsolar, in Germany (and we're part of the
development team). It's SI-only, with heating & cooling loads and just
about any system you want via its modularity - but it's a bit of a
learning curve. No BIM support, though (yet, anyways); it has its own
building model language, with a frontend to create the files. We use it
a lot for initial studies of a building's intrinsic performance (in
addition to later stuff). That is, you can create a building with no
mechancial systems and look at just the native heating & cooling loads,
to directly study various aspects of passive performance (solar, facade,
etc...). The homepage is here: http://sel.me.wisc.edu/trnsys/
 
Also, check out: http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/
 
It's a pretty decent reference, and includes a Country breakdown, though
I'm not sure how accurate it really is (based on the fact that trnsys is
not mentioned under Germany or France, where two of the four developer
companies are located).
 
Hope this helps,
Cramer

Dear BldgSim

 

I am trying to convert several Chinese cities' weather files from .epw
to .bin for eQuest use.  I downloaded the eQuest Weather format
converter but I keep getting "Invalid File Name."  I know this has been
an issue in the past due to a quick search in the archives but I was
unable to find a solution to the problem.

 

Please share your advice!  

 

Thanks very much in advance

Thanks Gerald!

That seemed to overcome the Invalid File Name error.  But the conversion
did not seem to complete.    

After hitting the Convert button, got these messages:
Weather data loaded successfully from EPW file.
Re-iterating Weather data cleaning process.
Weather data cleaning FAILED.
Weather data cleaning FAILED.

Also only a .csv file was generated, no .BIN file was generated.

I tried using the CSV Data Source Conversion tab but that has also
failed to work...

O OK. Install it directly in the weather file folder
in another folder called EPW. You might want to delete
any .INI file in the processor folder as the software
will recreate the .INI file when you open the EXE
file. Then try running the software again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] chilled water and hot water rates
Message-ID: <377095.3783.qm@web45113.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

Hello,

Has anyone come across average/typical national or regional rates for the production of chilled water or heating water?  I'm looking for something on a $/therm or other similar basis that could be used in a LEED energy model that is served by an existing campus central chilled water and heating plant.  Unfortunately, the owner does not meter the plant separately - either electrically or for chilled water or hot water production.  So, short of modeling the central plant (which we are trying to avoid), we're looking for typical rates that might be acceptable to use in a LEED energy model.

We have checked the US DOE site.  while they have typical national and regional rates for electricity, gas etc, we have not been able to find anything for chilled water or heating water.
If anyone has come across this type of info on the DOE site or elsewhere, please let me know.

Thanks.

 Julia

Message-ID: <25F2BDB6656B8F40A1289ED906D6B5CF038E0A4E@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

Hello,
 
I was hoping for some advice on modeling atriums in eQuest.  Up to this
point, I typically modeled an atrium by creating a space for each floor,
and joinning these spaces vertically using an open wall type
construction.  But after reviewing some of the results, I'm not sure
this is the best way to do this.
 
I'm currently modeling a 3-story atrium that has exterior walls as well
as interior walls that transmit light/heat to a 12-story building.
 
Can I model the atrium as a single sunspace (30 feet in height, defined
at the 1st floor), and use the adjacent spaces in the 12-story building
to define the shared interior walls with windows?  
 
Or do I need to model 3 separate sunspaces for each atrium floor level
and connect them vertically as I've previously done?
 
My concern is that some of the documentation for sunspaces says that you
should model the interior walls (and windows) in the sunspace in lieu of
the adjacent spaces that touch the sunspace.  But if I have a 3-story
tall atrium, I can't create a single 30 foot high wall that is
simultaneously adjacent to 3 stories of the 12-story building.  And I
can't create multiple walls at various Z values, can I?  Or can I?
 
Thanks for any assistance!  For some reason I still do all of the
programming in notepad instead of using the Wizard....

Message-ID: <C9D15FDE9DC3244EB971B56AD1604F8504840FB1@sg-exchbe3.smithgroup.com>

All,

 

I have a question of the energy modeling requirement based on the
contract modification.  We have previously completed an energy analysis
for a LEED CS project and finished EA credit 1 documentation.  This
project has been in the construction administration phase over one year.
Recently, a new auditorium is to be added in the courtyard as a contract
modification (new addition to the existing building).  The auditorium is
detached from the base building and will use a separate mechanical
system. 

 

Are we required to update the energy model for EA credit 1 for this new
auditorium?  I know that a CIR may be helpful for us, but it will take
sometime.  I just want to ask if anyone has some similar experience from
USGBC and would like to share?   Thanks for your help,

 

Best regards,

Message-ID: <9E3464C4BE9E8447B2DEBFEB0E296F9B0C6D9E94@FKENTERPRISE.FKUSA.ORG>

Hi,

I have a quick question about the EER requirement for the PTAC and PTHP
system. In Standard 2004, Table 6.8.1D gives out the minimum requirement
for the PTAC and PTHP system. My question is does this EER include the
fan power or not?

 

Also for the PTAC and PTHP system, following the Appendix G fan power
energy calculation, the fan power would be about 0.7~0.8W/cfm. However
the manufacture's catalog data usually gives out the value around
0.2~0.3W/cfm, which means the proposed case would get a lot of fan
energy savings. Does this make sense? Thanks a lot.

The EER does include the fan power. The baseline fan power allowance in Appendix G from 90.1 2004 was recognized as being much too high for PTACs and PTHPs. An addendum was issued lowering the value to 0.3 W/cfm. This is captured in the new 2007 version of 90.1 Appendix G.

Could anyone else comment on this?  I had asked this question a couple of
months ago, and through some research and guidance received the answer that:

The EER does include the fan power, which you would calculate from Table
6.8.1.D and you would calculate this for each system based upon it's
auto-sized capacity; thus, you will use a different EER for each system.

An important clause to then look at is G3.1.2.1 which states that equipment
efficiencies must be broken down into their component parts, such as the EER
into EIR and fan power.  One way of doing this is to parse it out using
equest, capturing the correct EIR and then plugging that back in with a
separate fan power.

To get the fan power you would use Table G3.1.2.9 to get BHP and calculate
the fan power from this.

All of this, though, is according to ASHRAE 2004, I have not been using the
2007 Addendum.  I just wanted to see if this is what everyone else has been
doing?

Mark,
 
I think we're all wondering the same thing. I heard various rumors of
ASHRAE and USGBC aligning their review cycles somehow, so both documents
progress hand-in-hand. I also heard that 2007 will be referenced by NC
3.0, which may be soon (within a year, fingers-crossed?).
 
However, there are already at least 10 addenda in draft status for
90.1-2007, so don't get your hopes up. And the day this gets easy is the
day we need to find new jobs. :-)

European Energy SimulationDesignBuilder is being used widely in Europe and supports SI and IP units. It combines energy simulation (including natural ventilation and daylight control) with heating and cooling load calculations. It has a high quality OpenGL user interface, uses the EnergyPlus simulation engine and also has Spanish and Italian language translation and support available. It does not yet support 3-D BIM but future versions will.

  As eQUEST does not currently support SI units, what energy simulation programs are typically used in European countries? Are there other programs used besides IES-VE, Ecotect and ESP-r that support SI units. Do any of these programs combine heating and cooling load calculation with energy simulation like Trane Trace 700? Which programs support 3-D BIM? We have projects coming up in Spain and Italy that need to be simulated by resident engineers.

The issue is slightly more complicated for unitary equipment over 5 tons
because the ARI 340/360 testing standard for determining the EER of larger
unitary equipment has pre-defined limits on the allowed fan ESP during test
conditions.  If you are simulating packaged equipment that is designed with
higher external fan static pressures than required by ARI 340/360 and you
use the as-designed fan power or fan power allowed by ASHRAE90.1 for
calculating "Cooling-Only" EER,  you will over-estimate cooling energy
savings.  This issues applies to Appendix G baseline systems 3,4,5 and 7 and
any as-designed equipment whose performance is covered by ARI 340/360 (see
minimum efficiency tables in Chapter 6 of ASHRAE 90).  
 
For packaged equipment over 5 tons you should estimate fan power at the ARI
340/360 test conditions when separating EER into fan and cooling energy
components rather than using rated fan power or the ASHRAE fan power
allowance.

Hi,

I have a quick question about the EER requirement for the PTAC and PTHP
system. In Standard 2004, Table 6.8.1D gives out the minimum requirement
for the PTAC and PTHP system. My question is does this EER include the
fan power or not?



Also for the PTAC and PTHP system, following the Appendix G fan power
energy calculation, the fan power would be about 0.7~0.8W/cfm. However
the manufacture's catalog data usually gives out the value around
0.2~0.3W/cfm, which means the proposed case would get a lot of fan
energy savings. Does this make sense? Thanks a lot.

Message-ID: <9228D7EC9A32594191AA7530DB53144905F52FD9@mail-3a.nrel.gov>

I'm trying to Model a Munters DryCool unit within Equest.  The
limitation I'm up against is that a Solid Desiccant wheel can only be
modeled as a preconditioner.  

 

What I need is to :

 

1.	Precool outside air with a DX coil to saturated air, 
2.	Run that saturated air through the Solid Desiccant, and 
3.	Finally run that air through a Cooling Coil served by a Chiller
before supplying to the space.  

 

Ultimately is there a way to model a Desiccant after a DX coil instead
of a preconditioner?

Umit,
	I believe that LEED NC 2.2 addresses how to take credit for "cool roofs". It states on page 180, "the Proposed design can use a modeled reflectivity of 0.45...versus the default reflectivity value of 0.30 which will be modeled for the Baseline Design.".
	
	This may be a case of necessary but not sufficient but I hope it helps.

I have an office building with compartmental cooling units on each floor and hot water reheat coils and baseboards for heating. The ventilation air is supplied from a make-up air unit on the roof. This MAU has an enthalpy wheel, but no heating or cooling coils. What is the correct way to model this MAU in equest?

 

Currently I have modeled this MAU as it's own heating/ventilation system with a 1ft? dummy zone. The compartmental systems have been set up to receive their outdoor air from this MAU system. However, equest has the MAU pulling the exhaust air from this unconditioned dummy zone. This results in the air being exhausted at a temperature slightly higher/lower than the outdoor air leaving the enthalpy wheel, rather than at room temperature.  This greatly underestimates the heating/cooling savings for this wheel. Therefore, would it be correct to break up this system and model it under the "Heat Recovery" section for the compartmental systems, with self-contained fans, rather than modeling it as a separate dedicated outdoor air system? Or how can I force my MAU system to exhaust from the conditioned zones?

I am currently doing an energy model for a building with varying roof
styles.  There are shed and gable roofs as well as different pitches and
overhangs.  Is there a simpler way to layout the roof other than
altering all the vertexes of each roof polygon?

For modeling apartment units on a high-rise building,
what would be a reasonable schedule or hours of use
per day.  I have an idea of 14 hours of use (5:30 pm
to 7:30 am) and 10 hours of non-use (regular work
hours).  Has anyone attempted to model ilumination for
apartment units, since they are exempt by ASHRAE 90.1?

Message-ID: <F8394E9839E76C44AE7D789C1B8FBB4F0A1C9A4E@norexchange.noresco.com>

Morning,

I'm having a problem similar to a post from March.  In my hourly reports - the "Temp of air leaving heat coil" is always very cold (55), and it seems to be tied to the value that I put in for the system under COOLING>Coil Cap>Zone Entering Min Supply Temp.  Also the "Temp of air leaving cool coil" is consistently greater than the temp leaving the heat coil, even though the cool coil is before the heat coil in the stream.  The system I'm modeling is a high humidity location where the OA is cooled to 55 then reheated to the setpoint via electric coils in the OA-AHU.
I took the advice from the last post and set my "Hot Deck Max Leaving Temp" to 72, but it had no effect.  Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks, Beka Shea

Matt, see the attached,  also, on our most recent LEED data center, we
have just assumed the data center as just one huge plug load.  ( our
data had a medium sized office component ).

Attached is a new interpretation to ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004

Does anyone have experience with either modeling or LEED certifying a

about documenting an energy savings associated with a multiple megawatt 
equipment load, and which option for EA Credit 1 previous data centers 
have accomplished.

Hello everybody,

I am trying to simulate a water source heat pump with a variable speed compressor in eQUEST. I have selected PVVT as the system and have come across some interesting results.

When the Single Speed compressor is selected under Cooling\Unitary Power\Cooling Compressor, the PS-C report shows the boiler and cooling tower both operating for various hours throughout the year, as expected. However, when the compressor is changed to Variable Speed, the boiler operation hours disappear, but the cooling tower hours remain. 

Is this because it simulates the heating DX coils as air cooled but the cooling DX coils as water cooled? If so, this is not a representation of a water source heat pump.

Any insight will be greatly appreciated.

Regards,

Dana

As I know, there is no water-to-air heat pump (packaged unit not the multi-split VRF) with variable speed compressor available on market yet though it is on the way. However, there is heat pump with staged capacity, which is typically implemented by 2-stage scroll compressor. I'm not sure how the selection of variable speed compressor affect the boiler operation, but it seems the variable speed compressor is not a valid option for water-to-air heat pump.

I've used eQUEST in Vista and haven't had any problems...I'd would imagine the same holds true for the rest but can't speak directly to the other programs.

Karen,
 We haven't run into any incompatibilities between TRNSYS and Windows 
Vista. The one annoyance with it is that Vista's security is very 
restrictive about what users and what programs can write in the \Program 
Files\ directory. As far as I have been able to tell only users with 
administrator privileges can write in that directory. If TRNSYS is 
installed in \Program Files then whoever is using it needs to have admin 
rights so that TRNSYS can write all of its log, list, and output files 
there. I don't think that this issue is specific to TRNSYS, I imagine 
that it will crop up with anything that is designed to be fully 
contained in a single directory that is installed in \Program Files.
Cheers,
 David

All,
Has anyone encountered an error in eQUEST stating failure to designate a RUN PERIOD? The default "Entire Year" run period is assigned with the default dates ranging from 1/1/1996-12/31/1996 - does anyone know where the RUN PERIOD link to the T24 compliance simulation? 
Any thoughts would be much appreciated.
Thanks,

Message-ID: <9E3464C4BE9E8447B2DEBFEB0E296F9B0C832C03@FKENTERPRISE.FKUSA.ORG>

Hi,

I have some questions about the Water-Side Economizer simulation in
eQUEST. I searched for this topic in the simulation group archive. It
seems that someone also had the problems with the simulation of
water-side economizer but no one answered it. 

 

Currently I am working with an office building with DX coil system. The
proposed design uses the water side economizer because the air-side
economizer is not available. I added the water side economizer into the
existing condenser water loop. But the simulated result showed the
system with water-side economizer had more energy consumption than the
system w/o economizer because of more energy consumed by the fan, pump
and cooling tower.

 

Here is question about the simulations setting in eQUEST for water-side
economizer:

1. what loop should the water-side economizer be attached to: the
current existing condenser water loop or a new condenser water loop? 

I tried both and got quite different results. None of them saved energy.

2. what temperature in eQUEST should be used for control the water
economizer? If the current existing condenser water loop is used, how to
control the temperature both for the water-side economizer and the DX
coil?

3. How to set the control for the cooling tower? 

 

Any suggestion would be much appreciated. 

 

Thanks.

EnergyPlus Version 2.2 Now Available

 

The latest release of the EnergyPlus building energy simulation program,
Version 2.2, was completed on April 22 (Earth Day!) and is now available
in versions for both the Windows and Linux operating systems. (Macintosh
version will be available within a few days.)  A few key new features
include a dual-setpoint humidistat, enhanced economizer controls,
greater flexibility in specifying internal gains (i.e., people, lights,
equipment) and ventilation/infiltration, a microturbine electric
generator model, and upgrades to the equivalent one-diode PV model . We
have updated and extended capabilities throughout the existing building
envelope, daylighting, and HVAC equipment and systems portions of the
program. 

 

The set of example input files now includes full-blown models of typical
new construction (drawn from the DOE Commercial Benchmarks project). 

 

EnergyPlus V 2.2 is available at no cost from the EnergyPlus web site:
www.energyplus.gov <http://www.energyplus.gov/> .

 

Also available - an update of the Energy Design Plugin for SketchUp -
version 0.94.  This version includes updates to use EnergyPlus Version
2.2 and bug fixes.

 

 

What's New in Version 2.2?

 

Data Sets          

*         Electronic enthalpy air-side economizer curves

Input    

*         Design days now allow scheduled input for Beam and Diffuse
Solar values.

*         Design days allow users to select periods from weather files
to be used in design/sizing calculations.

 

Daylighting

*         Reference point Illuminance levels calculated by DElight now
included in standard output variables.

 

Zone Model

*         Internal gains can now be entered in intensity:

vice versa (area/person).

o        Lighting can be entered as total Watts, Watts/floor area or
Watts/person.

*         Equipment (electric, gas, other) can be entered as Watts,
Watts/floor area or Watts/person.

            

Natural and Mechanical Ventilation     

*         Outside Air Controller now allows boosted air flow rates for
high humidity control. A schedule may also be used to operate the
outside air economizer based on a time-of-day schedule. Each of these
features is also included in the controller for the stand-alone energy
recovery ventilator.

*         Infiltration can be entered as total volume, volume/floor
area, volume/exterior surface area, or air changes per hour.

*         Ventilation, mixing and cross mixing can be entered as total
volume, volume/floor area, volume/person, or air changes/hour.

*         Airflow network model now includes more coil types, including
water cooling, water heating, detailed flat water cooling, multimode DX
cooling, and multispeed cooling and heating.

*         Multiple infiltration and ventilation objects now allowed in
each zone, and the temperature control limits for the ventilation object
can now be scheduled (instead of constant).

 

HVAC 

*         Dual-setpoint humidistat with deadband now available

*         Water heater volume and capacity can be autosized. 

*         Supply air fan operating mode (continuous versus cycling) can
now be scheduled based on time-of-day for window air conditioner,
packaged terminal heat pump and water-to-air heat pump.

*         New economizer controls added to Controller:Outside Air and
Controller:Stand Alone ERV objects. New controls include Dew Point
Temperature limit and Electronic (Variable) Enthalpy limit.

*         DX System (DXSystem:Airloop object) now allows cool-reheat
dehumidification control type.

 

On-Site Energy Supply

*         New operating scheme for electric generators to follow thermal
loads.

*         New microturbine electric generator model.

http://www.energyplus.gov/features.html
<http://www.energyplus.gov/features.html>   for a complete list of new
features added in this and previous versions.

 

Update on User Interfaces?

 

EP-Quick creates an EnergyPlus input file based on a broad range of zone
templates (released in April 2005).  DesignBuilder, a graphic user
interface, was released in December 2005.  Hevacomp uses EnergyPlus as
its simulation engine (2006).  First version of EFEN was released in
November 2007.  Several other interfaces are under development.  Watch
our web site ( http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_interfaces.html
<http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_interfaces.html>  ) for up-to-date
information on these and other interfaces.

 

A number of utilities and tools for creating, editing, and running input
files come with EnergyPlus, including IDF Editor, EP-Launch, and
HVAC-Diagram (see http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_utilities.html
<http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_utilities.html>  ). Third party tools for
creating, editing, and displaying EnergyPlus input files are also
available, including DrawBDL, EcoTect,  ESP-r, Green Building Studio,
EzDrawPlus, IFCtoIDF, TSe+, and EzPlus-Parm.  See
http://www.energyplus.gov/third_party_tools.html
<http://www.energyplus.gov/third_party_tools.html>  for more
information.

 

EnergyPlus Training Workshops

 

We are planning workshops throughout 2008.  For more information, please
see:  http://www.gard.com/training.htm
<http://www.gard.com/training.htm> 

 

What's going on in V2.2.0?

 

Will there be any considerable difference between version 2.1 and 2.2? 

 

Yes.... and no. The basic structure of EnergyPlus is still as it has
been but there are some significant changes that you will want to be
aware of:

 

As always, there are a number of new features and bug fixes.

 

How about IDF and IDD? Do they remain unchanged? 

 

There will be some changes in the IDD and reflected in IDFs.
Particularly for any new features, there will be new objects. 

 

Is version 2.2 backward compatible? Can I run v2.1 file in v2.2? 

 

For many options, the answer is yes. However, there are several changes
that require you to use the transition program for V2.2. EP-Launch can
check the selected file (if there is a version object) and you can
launch the Transition program from the EP-Launch "File" menu. You can
also view the ObjectStatus spreadsheet in the root folder of the
installed version. This file has detailed explanations of changes to the
objects. There is also a new option for the transition program that
allows you to supply a list of files and it will convert them for you.
The transition program is described more fully in the Auxiliary Programs
document.

Hello Ali,

 

I'm in a similar situation.  I haven't really thought it through yet,
but I was thinking about just finding an equivalent boiler efficiency.
Not really convenient, but I will probably have to resort to that.

 

What options have you considered?

Message-ID: <1873B5FA036E5C44B64225D88886F22C37E782@pelexch1.primerachicago.com>

eQuest Newbie question 1...When creating a building in eQuest that is
served by VAV and Fan-Powered Boxes, is it suggested that I create a
'zone' (using the wizard) for every single zone in the building that is
served by an individual VAV or FPB or should the zones be based purely
on similar exposures??

 

eQuest Newbie question 2...In the detailed edit mode, can I just have
one zone have daylight lighting controls while the other zones in the
system have generic lighting controls?  If so, how and where do I do
that?

 

eQuest Newbie question 3...In the detailed edit mode also, can I just
have one zone have Demand Control Ventilation while the other zones in
the system have a constant minimum OA value?  If so, how and where do I
do that?

This question is about the modelling the base case for 90.1-2004 
Appendix G.  I read that the base case walls should be modelled as 
Steel frame with the maximum U-value as noted in Tables 5.5-x.  Does 
this mean that the simulation output file should list the wall 
U-value as the same as noted in Tables 5.5-x for Steel Frame 
construction for the building type - Non-residential or Residential 
as the case may be?  For example, if the location points to Table 
5.5-1, I assume that the simulation output file should list the 
assembly U-value as U-0.124 for non-residential.

Thanks for you help!

Hello friends

I m working on a project for LEED and I have some problems regarding to this


On the site there is already one office building and few parking areas

Now the client wants to build two new building on same plot

One is new office building which is actually not a new building but a part
of existing office building

They are extending old office building and one is totally new warehouse
which is unconditional and nothing inside they are just using for storing
purpose

So in short one new office building which is a part of existing office
building and one new warehouse on same plot

The question is in which LEED category this project falls and how to do
energy modeling

Is it LEED NC, LEED core and shell or LEED for existing Building?

Message-ID: <2134a3b30804280732t62d4bb9did72ebc10798260ee@mail.gmail.com>

I think the unanswered question you're referring to is mine.  We were trying
to simulate Trane Self-Contained Air handlers (SWUDs).  McQuay and Carrier
also make these systems.  You may not be referring to this type of system.
SWUDs use an internal economizer on floor's air handler which uses condenser
water when OA Temp drops below a certain setpoint.  The waterside economizer
option in DOE 2.2 is not the same as the SWUD system, I think.  I believe
this can be simulated with equest using a seperate cooling tower and an
add-on indirect evaporative cooler.

In real life the WSE is controled by condenser water temperature.  In DOE
2.2 I believe the control temperature a constant user specified limit.

We never finished the model we were working on so I'm not sure how to
control the cooling tower.  Real SWUDs tie into the building's condenser
water loop.  So I assume you can use the same schedule on the evaporative
cooler's cooling tower as the CT for the DX systems.  Another energy firm
modeled the building and we did the base building design.  We are new to
energy modeling so every meeting we had with the Architect and other design
personnel we would pick the modelers' brains as to how they modeled these
systems.  Please let me know when you get the final model to work.

*Subject:* [Bldg-sim] Water-Side Economizer

Hi,

I have some questions about the Water-Side Economizer simulation in eQUEST.
I searched for this topic in the simulation group archive. It seems that
someone also had the problems with the simulation of water-side economizer
but no one answered it.



Currently I am working with an office building with DX coil system. The
proposed design uses the water side economizer because the air-side
economizer is not available. I added the water side economizer into the
existing condenser water loop. But the simulated result showed the system
with water-side economizer had more energy consumption than the system w/o
economizer because of more energy consumed by the fan, pump and cooling
tower.



Here is question about the simulations setting in eQUEST for water-side
economizer:

1. what loop should the water-side economizer be attached to: the current
existing condenser water loop or a new condenser water loop?

I tried both and got quite different results. None of them saved energy.

2. what temperature in eQUEST should be used for control the water
economizer? If the current existing condenser water loop is used, how to
control the temperature both for the water-side economizer and the DX coil?

3. How to set the control for the cooling tower?



Any suggestion would be much appreciated.



Thanks.

I have heard that opening a pd2 in a different version of eQUEST than
the version it was built in may cause some file changes.  Does anybody
know details on this?  I would like to be able to look at the pd2
without opening it in any one version and find which version it was
created in, in order to open it with it's original attributes.

If you open the .pdf file by right clicking on the file and selecting
'Open With' and choosing an appropriate text editor you can see which
version it was last run in.  Something like this should be at the top of
the file:

 

Proj   "eQUEST Project"  

   ProgramVersion = "eQUEST 3.61.5360"

   BDBaseVersion = 20

   ProductCode = "eQUEST"

If you open the PD2 file in notepad the first few lines will have something like:

Proj   "My big energy model"
   ProgramVersion = "eQUEST 3.60.5200"
   BDBaseVersion = 19
   ProductCode = "eQUEST"
   ...

I think that would show in my case eQuest 3.60 was the last version to run the file.

Opening older eQUEST files in newer versions will definitely change some
of the inputs and will give you different simulation numbers.
Furthermore, once you've opened the file in a newer version you can't
always go back to an older version.  I've learned this the hard way with
version 3.62b.  Definitely check what version you created the original
files in and use that for all of your runs.

Message-ID: <425CE15142917C41857CF0D16D2C4D7F0632C246@ftchex3.corp.ftch.com>

I am using EPW Weather File Conversion program "eQ_WthProc" to convert
EnergyPlus EPW files into eQUEST BIN files. After file is converted,
solar direct normal radiation values are blank and solar global
horizontal radiation values are all "9999" with following messages:

there's a streak of 8760 bad Solar starting on 1/1 at hour 24 (ending on
the last hour of the year)
copy from previous day failed, data for first good record used

And 

Weather data loaded successfully from EPW file.
Re-iterating Weather data cleaning process.
Weather data cleaning FAILED.
Weather data cleaning FAILED.

The program indicates:
The processor includes the ability to have direct normal solar data
re-calculated. 
Some epw files contain questionable direct normal solar values while
having 
seemingly good horizontal solar values; this problem can be diagnosed
using the 
"Review Converted Data" tab (described above) and noting direct normal
values that 
often or significantly exceed 1000. To correct problematic direct normal
values just 
check the "Calculate Solar Direct-Normal based on Global Horizontal"
check box on 
the "EPW Weather Files Conversion" tab and re-convert the data.

After checking box, program output is same with all blank and 9999 solar
radiation values.

Questions:
1. Is there a method to obtain correct solar radiation values from EPW
file using eQ_WthProc EPW Weather File Conversion program?
2. The average hourly statistics for direct normal solar radiation are
included in the EnergyPlus STAT file (summary data report). Can the STAT
file average hourly statistics for direct normal solar radiation be
manually input into CSV files and then converted to BIN files?

Hello all,

When using Equest (v3.60 and v3.61) for multiple different projects, why
does each project show up in the reports list when working on one
particular project?  I am also seeing duplicate simulation reports for
the current project I am working on from previous runs.  Why does this
happen and is there a way to avoid this by only having the current open
project and current run show up on the report list?  How can I ensure
input changes are not being carried over to the other projects on the
list?  Any insight you can give me will be helpful.  Thank you in
advance.

Steve, 

 

eQuest will apparently list all sim files in the current directory. You
might delete the other sim files if you don't need them.

To reflect the effect of the boiler and the fluid cooler that are attached to the heat pump loop and also considering the heat pump COP and EER (in heating and cooling modes), I modeled the water to water heat pump system as a distributed heat pump system. In this case the efficiency of the distributed heat pumps were adjusted based on the efficiencies of water to water heat pumps.

The boiler and fluid cooler were used to maintained the heat pump loop temperature at the desired condition (i.e. 70F and 90F in heating and cooling mode).

Hello Ali,

I'm in a similar situation.  I haven't really thought it through yet, but I was thinking about just finding an equivalent boiler efficiency.  Not really convenient, but I will probably have to resort to that.

What options have you considered?

All projects in the \projects directory are shown.  This is sometimes 
useful for comparisons across different projects ... and sometimes 
"unhelpful" such as when you don't want to show who your other clients 
are!  You can move projects out from under the \projects directory and 
they won't show up in the reports list.  I have a \project archive 
directory where "not to be seen" projects go to hide.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] night shading
Message-ID: <A6D2CA56F188534E9C3AA144D5305BDC04506FF4@pae-mail.pae.com>

Any advice on creating night shading?  The specification calls for
increasing the R value of the window from 2.5 to 7.7 for night blinds.
I created a conductance schedule with fraction values.  My  intention is
to increase the window R value by 100% to make it as close as possible
to 7.7 (2.5 to 5) and the max the fraction schedule allows. I have not
used this before.  

 

Thanks

Not sure if this will fill your requirements.
 
Look up CONDUCT-TMIN-SCH in the DOE-2.2 manuals. It appears you can
switch U-values on windows, but by outside air temp, not time.
 
But check this.

If you look under windows, and click the "blinds drapes switching" tab, you
can change window type based on outside temp or daylight level or solar
incidence, etc.  Then you can change glass types.  The catch is that the
glass type has to be a glass type code, not simplified data.  I have used
the switching capability for glass types that come loaded in the equest
library.  You should be able to create this data using Window5.

Our office is working on a job similar to this. For the existing 
building we are retrofitting and adjacent to the retrofit is the new 
construction of the same size. For our purposes LEED-EB made the most 
sense for the existing structure and LEED-NC is being used for the new 
construction. The USGBC allows this and may also provide insight for you 
and your specific site/context.

Good Luck.

Message-ID: <FA5ADDF4A8F8294482D7D6FE6FF87776027EFC17@tme-s05.tmecorp.com>

I am modeling a building with multiple areas served by multiple different
system types. It is tied to a campus chilled water and steam system; however,
I'm letting the wizard create a chiller and boiler plant for the chilled
water and heating water load. I have not left the wizard for any
modifications. When I finish in the DD wizard and simulate the project, I get
an error stating this:

***ERROR*********************************************************************
**

             In S8 Sys (VAVS)                   , cooling coil leaving
temperature must

             be at least 6F higher than entering water temp.

 

All the values for chilled water design temp and supply air temperature (the
only ones I think will affect it in the Wizard) have been left as the default
44 and 55 deg respectively. All other systems in the building modeled
properly. 

My co-worker is currently modeling a separate building on the same campus and
encountered the same exact problem with a different system type.

Has anyone else ever encountered this error? Is there a simple way to fix it?

Josh,

 

1.        I would say that you should create a separate zone for each
terminal unit, especially if it has a FPB. Even if the exposure has the
same, the internal loads may be different.

2.       Yes. BUILDING SHELL,  Space properties, Daylighting tab

3.       Yes. AIR-SIDE-HVAC, System properties, Outdoor Air tab, Outdoor
Ventilation Air; Minimum OA Sizing Method - Select DCV Return Sensor
(See attached file)

 

Good luck!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] VAV zone/Daylighting/DCV questions...

 

eQuest Newbie question 1...When creating a building in eQuest that is
served by VAV and Fan-Powered Boxes, is it suggested that I create a
'zone' (using the wizard) for every single zone in the building that is
served by an individual VAV or FPB or should the zones be based purely
on similar exposures??

 

eQuest Newbie question 2...In the detailed edit mode, can I just have
one zone have daylight lighting controls while the other zones in the
system have generic lighting controls?  If so, how and where do I do
that?

 

eQuest Newbie question 3...In the detailed edit mode also, can I just
have one zone have Demand Control Ventilation while the other zones in
the system have a constant minimum OA value?  If so, how and where do I
do that?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] idf editor in Linux through wine

Hi there

Does anybody have experience running idf editor (version 2.2) in Linux 
through Wine? I can't make ti work it crashes frequently.

It would be really very nice to have the whole suite of energy plus 
support programs in Linux version :) or at least ep-launch and idf
editor


Thanks

Our office is working on a job similar to this. For the existing 
building we are retrofitting and adjacent to the retrofit is the new 
construction of the same size. For our purposes LEED-EB made the most 
sense for the existing structure and LEED-NC is being used for the new 
construction. The USGBC allows this and may also provide insight for you 
and your specific site/context.

Good Luck.

Building SIM,

I've got a building with some shop spaces which are conditioned with a
combination of a heat recover ventilator & some separate cabinet unit
and radiant (elec) heaters (no cooling). Any suggestions on the best
system to use for the heat recovery unit?

I was going to use a unit ventilator since the description in the DOE-2
help file (Volume 5) 'Default Heating and Cooling Systems' gives a
description of, "Electric Furnace with zone ventilation" but it doesn't
allow heat recovery.

 

Thanks

Message-ID: <21B0B92BAE9B75458CA9781211D5330301E3736D@CD1001-M200.corp.ads>

Appendix A of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 states that:
 
"The opaque mullions of the spandrel shall be covered with insulation
complying with the steel-framed wall requirements."
 
My climate zone requires both cavity and continuous insulation.
 
Am I to take this that the spandrel should be covered with both the
R-value of the cavity and continuous or just the continuous insulation?
 
Does the spandrel glass need to be covered?
 
thanks.
Tim.

How about using VAVs and set the schedule of the space only for heating?
