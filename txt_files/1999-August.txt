We have the following vacancies for PhD studentships - I would be most
grateful if you could draw them to the attention of any potential candidates.

LOUGHBOROUGH UNIVERSITY
DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AND BUILDING ENGINEERING

Research Studentships in Building HVAC Systems Simulation and Optimization

The Building Services Research Group has three three-year PhD studentships 
available from 1st October 1999.

1. Automatic Generation of HVAC Systems Configuration

This project is concerned with the development of techniques for the 
automatic production of functional configurations of building HVAC 
(heating, ventilation and air-conditioning) plant. The planned approach
is to use genetic algorithms in conjunction with fuzzy rule-based methods 
to generate functionally viable system configurations.

2. Optimization of HVAC System Design and Performance

This research involves the combination of modular system simulation with
optimization techniques (including genetic algorithms) to produce optimum 
system performance as defined by a range of objective functions such as 
energy consumption, capital or life-cycle cost.

The above studentships are funded from a project sponsored by the American 
Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers: this 
covers tuition fees at either Home/EEC or Overseas student rates, together 
with a subsistence allowance of GBP 6,620 p.a.

3. Fault Detection/Diagnosis in HVAC Plant

This work will use an existing numerical model of a large (3MW) climatic 
control plant for an automobile testing wind tunnel as a basis for 
developing automatic fault detection techniques and condition-based 
maintenance.

The project involves close liaison with the Motor Industry Research 
Association at Nuneaton, UK. Support covers tuition fees at Home/EEC student
rate plus subsistence of GBP 6,620 p.a. 

The successful candidates will join a group of five staff with an 
established track record in simulation and optimization research, in a 
Department rated 5 in the 1996 RAE. 

Candidates for all positions should have a good first degree in a relevant 
science or engineering discipline, together with some experience of 
programming in a high level language. Familiarity with building HVAC systems 
would be an advantage.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE-2.1E Glass U-Value
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199908101652.AA523506MD65670@gard.com>

I am doing some DOE-2.1E runs and get slightly different 
values from two different loads verification reports for 
the glass I'm using.  Here is the part of the input file:

##set1 UF 0.45
GT1    GLASS-TYPE  
       SHADING-COEF       0.379
       GLASS-CONDUCTANCE  #[1 / #[ #[1 / UF[]] - 0.2986 ]] 
       PANES              1 
       FRAME-CONDUCTANCE  0.001  .. 

I'm not using the Window 4 library.  The equation removes 
the outside film coefficient from UF in the GLASS-
CONDUCTANCE input assuming a 7.5 mph wind speed.  In 
addition, I have no frame area defined.  Unfortunately, the 
LV-H and LV-D report show different results.  The LV-H 
report shows 0.450 as the center of glass u-value and this 
includes the film coefficient.  The LV-D report shows 0.430 
as the average u-value for the window.  Which one is right? 
LV-H seems to be the correct value but why aren't they 
consistent?

Any suggestions would be welcome.

Jason:

Their is a problem in the verification reports.
LV-D uses an outside air film resistance of 0.4;
LV-H uses 0.2986 (the same value you used).
Note that this does not affect the hourly window
heat transfer calculation; there the outside film
resistance is not constant but depends on windspeed,
surface to air temperature difference and window slope.

I'll make a fix so that LV-D and LV-H use the same
outside film resistance value.

Thanks to all who responded to my fan powered VAV question.  

Here's a followup to EnergyPlus Users:  How well does EnergyPlus model Fan powered VAV systems?  The system should be able to model variable air volume in cooling mode, DX cooling, parallel fan-powered boxes that induce air from a plenum, and thermostatically contolled reheat in the VAV box.

Answer (thanks to Fred Porter of Architectural Energy Corp)
You must decompose the packaged unit into a AHU/CHW/Chiller/Tower system. (No PIU in PVAVS) Set pump heads to near zero. Adjust tower approaches, or adjust virtual chiller EIR to get a reasonable representation of the kW/ton.

You can't use a doe-2 "plenum" as induced-air-zone. Take your pick, either use the core zone, or the perimeter zone itself.

Make sure to coordinate box fan setpoints, and box reheat setpoints as outlined in various 2.1 and 2.2 manuals.

	)
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199908040119.AA191651MD63882@gard.com>

Dear Group:

A few years ago we purchased DOE-2 compatible weather data for 1994 and
1995.  This data was in the CD144 format and was easy to pack for use with
DOE-2.

Unfortunately, I can't remember who we purchased the data from!  I contacted
WeatherServ who advertises in the back of the Energy User News.
Unfortunately, they can't produce DOE-2 compatible data sets yet.

Any idea where year specific, DOE-2 compatible, USA weather data can be
purchased?

Our needs are immediate.  Thanks in advance for any information.

Best Regards,

John P. Karasaki, P.E.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199908030958.AA581554MD63745@gard.com>

To PowerDOE/DOE-2 users:
Has anyone out there successfully modeled a DX fan-powered VAV system in doe-2.2 or doe-2.1e?  If so, what system did you use and how did you model the fan box part of it?  

The system I have in mind must have the following functionality:
-VAV
-DX cooling
-Evaporative condensing
-Parallel fan-powered boxes that induce air from a plenum
-Thermostatically contolled reheat in the VAV box

This is one of the most common types of HVAC systems around, so I am wondering if someone out there has had any more luck than me in attempting to conquer the challanges of accurately modeling its controls & functionality.  

Any thoughts?
