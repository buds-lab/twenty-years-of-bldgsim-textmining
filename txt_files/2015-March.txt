DesignBuilder are running a simulation training course in collaboration with University College London (UCL) from 13th to 17th April. This face to face course in London is an excellent opportunity to find out how to get the most out of DesignBuilder EnergyPlus and learn best practice modelling techniques. It is suitable for new and experienced users alike, and is structured to give you plenty of worked examples so you can 'learn by doing'. The last 2 days will be of particular interest for those wanting to get up to speed with CFD and EnergyPlus HVAC system simulations. Our new VRF capability will be included in the Detailed HVAC day.
The course is completely modular and you can choose to attend any of the 5 days according to your particular training requirements:

Day 1: 13th April - Modeller. To show you how to confidently and quickly set up building geometry, import floor plans and gbXML models, zone the building and define and select constructions and glazing. We'll also explain how our data inheritance feature can dramatically reduce the amount of data input required to help speed up modelling and reduce the risk of input errors.

Day 2: 14th April - Basic Simulation*. Learn how to quickly model external influences such as non-standard ground conditions, adjacent buildings and shading objects; use templates for improved modelling efficiency; run heating and cooling designs and simulations and review results; easily add solar shading; and input model data such as lighting and HVAC efficiently.

Day 3: 15th April - Daylighting, Natural Ventilation & Renewables*. Modelling low environmental impact design solutions including daylighting using our integrated Radiance tool, natural ventilation, mixed mode, PV and wind turbines.

Day 4: 16th April - Introduction to Detailed HVAC*. Introducing EnergyPlus HVAC modelling in DesignBuilder and getting started with Detailed HVAC including HVAC templates to quickly load pre-configured HVAC systems, VRF modelling, HVAC plant loops and our Results Viewer.

Day 5: 17th April - CFD*. Learn the key concepts of internal and external CFD from the basic building blocks through to using simulation data to define boundary conditions more accurately.
*Note that Days 2-5 all require previous experience with the modeller or attendance on Day 1.
The cost of the course is ?250 GBP per day, with significant discounts available for academia. Discounts are also available for multiple bookings.
You can find out more about the UCL simulation training course (and indeed our extensive worldwide training schedule) by contact the office or via the training page on our website:

We hope to see you there!

Dear Forum,
The refrigerated warehouse we're modeling uses an "economizer" to help
unload the compressors in the winter. As I understand it, the system works
something like hot gas bypass for commercial air conditioners and routes
hot gas to the inlet of the compressor.
I don't see a direct method of modeling this, so I plan to create a
modified capacity curve for the compressors in order to represent the
impact of this "economizer".

   1. Do you have a better idea?
   2. Any cautions that apply to this approach from your experience?
   3.

Jim,

Could your ?economizer? be a system that simply brings in cold outside air during the winter? Here is an example: http://freeaire.com/ We have seen these in refrigerated spaces.

Thanks, Keith, but the refrigeration designer specifically said that it's
refrigerant introduced to the compressor inlet.
This makes sense to me as a capacity reduction technique, but I'm not as
well-versed in industrial refrigeration as I am in commercial
refrigeration, so I'm looking for input about how best to model it.

Hi all,

Continuing with the history of LEED v4 I read that in the credit EApr2 we still have the old excel file for the Table 1.4 that we need to submit with the energy modelling.

Since this old file has been done with ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Appendix G modelling requirements. Someone of you has the main changes we need to made in order to update or adapt to ASHRAE 90.1-2010 Appendix G?

Leed says that this old Table must be submitted with all registered projects. Someone of you know when this table file finally will be adapted to the newest versions of ASHRAE 90.1-2010 and 2013?

Thanks in advance for your help,

Best,
David GARCIA-SANCHEZ

David,
That old Excel file is superceded by another called "Minimum Energy
Performance Calculator".  It's much more detailed and not particularly easy
to use, but it's workable.
Look for it on the LEED site.

I downloaded the calculator to have a look.  On the Lighting tab I selected Space by Space Method.  The Proposed case has two comments.  The first one, on row 46, column L/M states: ?Credit for automatic lighting controls should be modeled using the appropriate power adjustment factor from Table G3.2, applied only to the controlled lighting power and not where required by 9.4.1 per Table G3.1#6(g)?.  Fair enough.  But on the row below, the comment states: ?For Space by Space Method Enter the design lighting power density for this space in the Proposed case.  This value should not include Table G3.2 adjustments?.  I?m confused?

David,
That old Excel file is superceded by another called "Minimum Energy Performance Calculator".  It's much more detailed and not particularly easy to use, but it's workable.
Look for it on the LEED site.

Hi all,

Continuing with the history of LEED v4 I read that in the credit EApr2 we still have the old excel file for the Table 1.4 that we need to submit with the energy modelling.

Since this old file has been done with ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Appendix G modelling requirements. Someone of you has the main changes we need to made in order to update or adapt to ASHRAE 90.1-2010 Appendix G?

Leed says that this old Table must be submitted with all registered projects. Someone of you know when this table file finally will be adapted to the newest versions of ASHRAE 90.1-2010 and 2013?

Thanks in advance for your help,

Best,

Christopher,
I was confused as well and that's part of what I meant by saying "not
particularly easy to use". Another aspect of that is its
non-intuitiveness.  I think it was created by a bunch of engineers (bless
their hearts) who didn't try it out on others very widely before releasing
it.
It takes some time, experimentation and examination of formulae to figure
out what it's doing, but it can be done without too many aspirin :)

Hi Jim,

If I?ve understood your situation correctly I believe you should be looking at the ?Minimum unloading ratio? field, which you can find at the bottom of the ?Chiller Data? edit dialog in DesignBuilder (see below). This field relates to ?false-loading? (hot gas bypass) of compressors under part-load conditions. There is a more detailed explanation in the DesignBuilder Help file which I?ve also copied below FYI.

Hope that helps,

Dave

Thanks, Keith, but the refrigeration designer specifically said that it's refrigerant introduced to the compressor inlet.
This makes sense to me as a capacity reduction technique, but I'm not as well-versed in industrial refrigeration as I am in commercial refrigeration, so I'm looking for input about how best to model it.

Dear Forum,
The refrigerated warehouse we're modeling uses an "economizer" to help unload the compressors in the winter. As I understand it, the system works something like hot gas bypass for commercial air conditioners and routes hot gas to the inlet of the compressor.
I don't see a direct method of modeling this, so I plan to create a modified capacity curve for the compressors in order to represent the impact of this "economizer".

 1.  Do you have a better idea?
 2.  Any cautions that apply to this approach from your experience?

DesignBuilder are running a simulation training course in collaboration with University College London (UCL) this April. This face to face course in London is an excellent opportunity to find out how to get the most out of DesignBuilder EnergyPlus and learn best practice modelling techniques. It is suitable for new and experienced users alike, and is structured to give you plenty of worked examples so you can 'learn by doing'. The last 2 days will be of particular interest for those wanting to get up to speed with CFD and EnergyPlus HVAC system simulations. Our new VRF capability will be included in the Detailed HVAC day.
The course is completely modular and you can choose to attend any of the 5 days according to your particular training requirements:

Day 1: 13th April - Modeller. To show you how to confidently and quickly set up building geometry, import floor plans and gbXML models, zone the building and define and select constructions and glazing. We?ll also explain how our data inheritance feature can dramatically reduce the amount of data input required to help speed up modelling and reduce the risk of input errors.

Day 2: 14th April - Basic Simulation*. Learn how to quickly model external influences such as non-standard ground conditions, adjacent buildings and shading objects; use templates for improved modelling efficiency; run heating and cooling designs and simulations and review results; easily add solar shading; and input model data such as lighting and HVAC efficiently.

Day 3: 15th April - Daylighting, Natural Ventilation & Renewables*. Modelling low environmental impact design solutions including daylighting using our integrated Radiance tool, natural ventilation, mixed mode, PV and wind turbines.

Day 4: 16th April - Introduction to Detailed HVAC*. Introducing EnergyPlus HVAC modelling in DesignBuilder and getting started with Detailed HVAC including HVAC templates to quickly load pre-configured HVAC systems, VRF modelling, HVAC plant loops and our Results Viewer.

Day 5: 17th April - CFD*. Learn the key concepts of internal and external CFD from the basic building blocks through to using simulation data to define boundary conditions more accurately.
*Note that Days 2-5 all require previous experience with the modeller or attendance on Day 1.
The cost of the course is ?250 GBP per day, with significant discounts available for academia. Discounts are also available for multiple bookings.
You can find out more about the UCL simulation training course (and indeed our extensive worldwide training schedule) by contact the office or via the training page on our website:

Jim,

We see this type of free cooling in data centers applications too.
I suspect the type of economizer you might have to be one of 2: refrigerant migration or pumped refrigerant systems.
The refrigerant will migrate to the point of lowest temperature in the system (migration type during colder month, the condenser outlet will be colder than your evaporator) or will be pumped to the condenser (pumped refrigerant type).

The way I dealt with this is to add a free cooling device at the plant level in the model (trace/eQuest) without altering the capacity curves.

All the best,
Hayssam

Day 1: 13th April - Modeller. To show you how to confidently and quickly set up building geometry, import floor plans and gbXML models, zone the building and define and select constructions and glazing. We?ll also explain how our data inheritance feature can dramatically reduce the amount of data input required to help speed up modelling and reduce the risk of input errors.

Day 2: 14th April - Basic Simulation*. Learn how to quickly model external influences such as non-standard ground conditions, adjacent buildings and shading objects; use templates for improved modelling efficiency; run heating and cooling designs and simulations and review results; easily add solar shading; and input model data such as lighting and HVAC efficiently.

Day 3: 15th April - Daylighting, Natural Ventilation & Renewables*. Modelling low environmental impact design solutions including daylighting using our integrated Radiance tool, natural ventilation, mixed mode, PV and wind turbines.

Day 4: 16th April - Introduction to Detailed HVAC*. Introducing EnergyPlus HVAC modelling in DesignBuilder and getting started with Detailed HVAC including HVAC templates to quickly load pre-configured HVAC systems, VRF modelling, HVAC plant loops and our Results Viewer.

Day 5: 17th April - CFD*. Learn the key concepts of internal and external CFD from the basic building blocks through to using simulation data to define boundary conditions more accurately.
*Note that Days 2-5 all require previous experience with the modeller or attendance on Day 1.
The cost of the course is ?250 GBP per day, with significant discounts available for academia. Discounts are also available for multiple bookings.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] 90.1-2010 baseline HVAC system question
Message-ID: <25F861E695EA99478F9790869A57C7D41BD99096@catormsx02>

The proposed design is 3 floor or less and less than 25,000 ft2, nonresidential.  The proposed design HVAC system is water source VRF with dry cooler and natural gas boiler.  I believe this qualifies as Fossil/Electric Hybrid, therefore the Baseline system would be System 3, PSZ-AC.  I believe the baseline heating fuel should be natural gas.  Is this interpretation correct?

Thanks for your thoughts.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] heat dissipation of hydro electric generator
Message-ID: <CAK01WzafgJ6qaPZ3_xhaqUb_YgQsLBQSyTrnFzjWxCb9=gBERA@mail.gmail.com>

Folks

I have a few questions on indoor condition of a powerhouse (hydro-electric
generator).

1. I believe there are a lot of research done on the effect of temperature
inside the powerhouse to the electricity production and equipment lifetime.
Anybody can point me in the right direction where I can find such research?

2. What is the optimum temperature and the maximum temperature for indoor
air?

3. Is there any study on the heat dissipation/generation by the
turbine/generator? Is there a simple relationship of heat gain based on the
kW generated?

4. Is there minimum ventilation requirement for a powerhouse?

5. Is there any other indoor air quality requirements? I don't believe
there will be pollutant generation in a hydro-electric plant?

Thanks a lot in advance.

Ery

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Baseline case pressure drop credit calculation
Message-ID: <25F861E695EA99478F9790869A57C7D41BD99866@catormsx02>

A question about pressure drop credit calculation:
Table 6.5.31.1B lists the pressure drop adjustment values.  My example is a zonal system (fan coils, heat pumps, etc.).  Outdoor air is ducted from an ERV make-up air system to each zonal system.  The make-up air system has a heat recovery device and a MERV 13 filter.  Does one take credit for the devices on the make-up air system when calculating the baseline fan power for the respective systems?

As only a fraction of the supply flow of the zonal systems comes from the make-up air system, it seems inappropriate to take credit for devices on the make-up air system?

Yes, you only get to take the pressure drop adjustment for baseline systems serving spaces that are served by the MAU in your proposed.  I have even been asked to only apply the PD to the amount of airflow the system with the filter supplies, but this was in a situation where the amount of return air very high in comparison.

DesignBuilder/EnergyPlus Trainings Scheduled

DesignBuilder is a state-of-the-art whole building energy analysis software tool for evaluating building energy, carbon, lighting and comfort performance. Developed to simplify the process of building simulation, DesignBuilder allows you to rapidly compare the function and performance of building designs and deliver results on time and on budget.

The training will be run using version 4 of DesignBuilder and will cover many of the new and enhanced features such as the new geometric modeler with enhanced block geometry editing, the ability to mirror blocks, add individual surfaces, and produce cut-away/section visualizations. Version 4 can produce ASHRAE 90.1 standards compliant baseline models required of various credit and certification programs including LEED, IRS, etc.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days. 

The course is organized so that architects could attend only the first 2-3 days and the last 2 days are specific to engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Locations & Dates

*	Irwindale, California; March 30 - April 3, 2015 
*	Durham, North Carolina; May 11-15, 2015 
*	San Francisco, California; September 21-25, 2015 

Discounts are available for students/researchers/faculty and multiple company attendees booking 4 or more days. 

Space is limited so we encourage early registration.

Additional course information and registration <http://designbuilderusa.com/training/designbuilder-simulation-training-days> .

Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use, most powerful graphical user interface to EnergyPlus available and includes ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Baseline HVAC System templates, materials, and construction libraries.

Message-ID: <CAEB-YaoV+OeXTyqNR1xHC_hr=JRiMZrSwdbW_uHL98ThBj=dQw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I got review for IGBC green homes for energy credit. And it is as follow;

1.      1) *Please provide the details about loads considered under the
head of ?heat Rejection? and  Explain energy conservation measure to
quantify the energy savings*

*2) *1.      The project has not provided any consumption values for
Receptacle, process and equipment loads. Please note that these loads
should be considered and default consumption

should be considered as 25% of the total energy cost. For buildings, where
the process energy cost is less than 25% of the baseline building energy
cost, the

Submittal must include supporting documentation substantiating that process
energy inputs are appropriate. Receptacle and Process loads include, but
are not limited to, refrigerator, washing machine, television, electric
geysers, computers, parking garage exhaust, pumps & motors, elevators, etc.,



It would be very helpful , if any experts can explain what i need to do to
reply to these queries.


Thanks!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Need help in IGBC review for energy credits

Without knowing the specifics of your project (and based only on the projects I?ve submitted to the USGBC, not IGBC), I?d say:


1)      Heat Rejection is typically energy use for cooling tower fans (or similar system) as opposed to compressors (which usually shows up in Space Cooling category if you are using eQUEST). So the reviewer seems to be confused why there are (significant?) differences in the amount of cooling tower energy use between the baseline and proposed. Can you justify/back up the difference by showing that the energy conservation measures/systems used in the project result in less run-time for cooling tower or significantly more efficient cooling tower operation.


2)      For residential applications, I like to use the calculators provided as part of the Energy Star Multifamily High Rise Program to estimate plug-loads. This is the standard referred to for LEED for Homes Midrise as well.
Guidelines can be found here:
http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/bldrs_lenders_raters/downloads/mfhr/ENERGY%20STAR%20MFHR%20Simulation%20Guidelines_Version_1%200_Rev03.pdf?8a21-7115

Excel Sheet for calculating plug loads (and DHW loads, and many other useful tools) here:
http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/bldrs_lenders_raters/downloads/mfhr/ENERGY%20STAR%20MFHR%20Performance%20Path%20Calculator_V1.4_BLANK.xls?8a21-7115



I would think that if you used this tool to develop your plug loads and submitted it to the reviewer it would be adequate documentation to justify whatever % energy use it comes out to, even if less than 25%. Note that these standards were really developed with the US market in mind, so for an international project you may have to use your discretion to adjust some of the values to be more appropriate for the market.

Hope this helps,

Dear all,

I got review for IGBC green homes for energy credit. And it is as follow;
1.      1) Please provide the details about loads considered under the head of ?heat Rejection? and  Explain energy conservation measure to quantify the energy savings
2) 1.      The project has not provided any consumption values for Receptacle, process and equipment loads. Please note that these loads should be considered and default consumption
should be considered as 25% of the total energy cost. For buildings, where the process energy cost is less than 25% of the baseline building energy cost, the
Submittal must include supporting documentation substantiating that process energy inputs are appropriate. Receptacle and Process loads include, but are not limited to, refrigerator, washing machine, television, electric geysers, computers, parking garage exhaust, pumps & motors, elevators, etc.,


It would be very helpful , if any experts can explain what i need to do to reply to these queries.

Message-ID: <SN2PR0601MB7688803CABFA1FD3C244729D0030@SN2PR0601MB768.namprd06.prod.outlook.com>

I posted this question to the EnergyPlus yahoo support group and the Unmet Hours online forum and have received no replies after a week!  So I thought I'd pass it along to this group:


Hello all!

I'm attempting to model dehumidifcation in EnergyPlus and I'm getting some strange results. When using a constant 62.5% Relative Humidity setpoint versus no dehumidification in New Orleans LA, the EUI jumps from 70 kBtu/sf-yr to 91 kBtu/sf-yr. Cooling energy increased by about 30%, and heating increases by a factor of 5.6!
Image - https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6aA8ZsOIiibQUJSa2g5Z2pnMkE/view?usp=sharing


The project is a 400 square foot classroom "shoebox" that I'm running some infiltration sensitivity analysis on. Thus, I want to make sure I'm capturing the energy impact of dehumidification accurately. I'm using the HVACTemplate:System:Unitary template (everything is autosized), and I've input "CoolReheat" in the "! - Dehumidification Control Type" field. I've added a "ZoneControl:Humidistat" object that uses a compact schedule with a "percent" schedule type limits that uses 62.5 all year. After inspecting the expanded file, the AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool object has a "CoolReheat" designation in the "! - Dehumidification Control Type" and an additional reheat coil appeared. Everything looks good.

So, why is the reheat and cooling energy increase so high? The scheme seems to be working, only 6% of all hours are above 62.5% relative humidity. I think the main problem is that with dehumidification, the cooling coil drops the temperature to 5 deg C (42 deg F) in some cases (see below graph). This seems unreasonable, and may be why there is so much reheat and coling energy, as actual systems would never really drop it below 55 deg F. I don't know how to control this, and I can't find a setpont manager that controls the subcooling routine for the dehumidification.
Image - https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6aA8ZsOIiibQm9rdDNUZFYwS0E/view?usp=sharing


here appears to be a "!-minimum supply air temperature" field in the "SetpointMnager:SingleZone:Reheat" object set at 13, but it doesn't seem to have an effect.

Is there a way to control this? Am I missing anything?

Here is a link to the .idf in case it helps - https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6aA8ZsOIiibLWpqR1JCbVhyOWs/view

Jacob,
I'm  big fan of Output:Variables in E+ and use them liberally to see
whether setpoints are met and to get clues about why setpoints are NOT met.
I see that you have a number of them in your IDF; have you evaluated those
values against the HVAC controls?

   - Is the RH setpoint consistently met?
   - You expect cooling, heating and overall energy to increase with
   controlled dehumidification (and they did), so are you concerned only with
   the magnitude of the jump?

I think some review of the energy for depressing discharge air temp to get
lower dewpoint, along with confirmation that the heating energy is
appropriate, will help you a lot.  You may also benefit from reporting the
variables at "timestep" instead of "hourly".

(I missed your post on the E+ forum)

Hi Jacob,
I think I identified a problem but not the full solution for it. If you check the zone temperature during summer period you'll see that during unoccupied period the zone is cooled down to 15C which is actually your heating setback temperature. To achieve such a low temperature the supply air?has to be sub-cooled to 5C which, as you mentioned, is unrealistic. I cannot source the root of this issue.The partial solution is to control the zone conditions by single heating and single cooling thermostats. As soon as I changed to single cooling thermostat during summer period, the system behaves as it should (supply air temperature around 15C, zone air temperature according to cooling occupied/unoccupied setpoints).?Another possible way of overriding the issue is to replace Fan:OnOff with Fan:ConstantVolume and keep DualSetpoint control. This doesn't completely remove periods when the supply air temperature is around 5C, although it significantly reduces it.I hope you'll find this answer useful.?Best regards,Ivanp.s. I'll post this reply to UnmetHours and Yahoo e+ group as well.

I am wondering what the GBCI policy is on self-sizing air flows at the zone level for multi-zone system such as VAVS, IU, etc. for the proposed design model.  I have always been of the thought that the zone air flows should be explicitly sized in the proposed case model.

As always, thank you for your valuable insights.

The proposed should reflect the actual design within the constraints of App G.  Only the baseline should be auto-sized.

Hi Christopher,

 

The Proposed building modeling protocols are stipulated by ASHRAE Appendix G. Table G3.1 Section 10(b) states that when a complete HVAC system has been designed, the Proposed building model HVAC components must be consistent with the design documents. As such, if the air flows at the zone level are on the mechanical plans or schedules, then the model must use those values, not auto-sizing.

 

Regards,

 

Please note I have a new phone number.

Jim ?

Thanks for the reply!  According to the hourly outputs (currently the simulation is at a ?1? timestep) the relative humidity setpoint is indeed being met 94% of the time, so the system seems to be working well, almost too well for a subcool reheat system if you ask me.

I do expect an increase, and I?m indeed questioning the magnitude of the jump.  I don?t really have much of a frame of reference as research/simulation study material on this is scarce.  The ASHRAE 1254-RP from 2006 is the only thing I?ve seen quantifying the energy effect and effectiveness of commercial HVAC systems and dehumidification.  They modeled 17 different system configurations in E-plus for a variety of building types/climates, and reported the hours above 65% RH and the increase in annual HVAC cost. For a DX system w/subcool Reheat for Miami and a 9 month school ------ 2222 hours (25%) of hours are above the RH threshold and this creates an 11% increase in HVAC energy.  So my 6% of hours above the RH setpoint and 30% energy increase seems too big.

However, the main reason why I think it?s unreasonable is that I don?t believe that the supply air temperature should ever drop to 5 deg C (41 deg F) to dehumidify.  I think most dx systems won?t go past 55 deg F, but I can?t seem to control this setpoint in Eplus.

Cheers and thanks for your help!

Jacob,
I'm  big fan of Output:Variables in E+ and use them liberally to see whether setpoints are met and to get clues about why setpoints are NOT met.
I see that you have a number of them in your IDF; have you evaluated those values against the HVAC controls?

  *   Is the RH setpoint consistently met?
  *   You expect cooling, heating and overall energy to increase with controlled dehumidification (and they did), so are you concerned only with the magnitude of the jump?
I think some review of the energy for depressing discharge air temp to get lower dewpoint, along with confirmation that the heating energy is appropriate, will help you a lot.  You may also benefit from reporting the variables at "timestep" instead of "hourly".

(I missed your post on the E+ forum)

Hello all!

I'm attempting to model dehumidifcation in EnergyPlus and I'm getting some strange results. When using a constant 62.5% Relative Humidity setpoint versus no dehumidification in New Orleans LA, the EUI jumps from 70 kBtu/sf-yr to 91 kBtu/sf-yr. Cooling energy increased by about 30%, and heating increases by a factor of 5.6!
Image - https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6aA8ZsOIiibQUJSa2g5Z2pnMkE/view?usp=sharing


The project is a 400 square foot classroom "shoebox" that I'm running some infiltration sensitivity analysis on. Thus, I want to make sure I'm capturing the energy impact of dehumidification accurately. I'm using the HVACTemplate:System:Unitary template (everything is autosized), and I've input "CoolReheat" in the "! - Dehumidification Control Type" field. I've added a "ZoneControl:Humidistat" object that uses a compact schedule with a "percent" schedule type limits that uses 62.5 all year. After inspecting the expanded file, the AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool object has a "CoolReheat" designation in the "! - Dehumidification Control Type" and an additional reheat coil appeared. Everything looks good.

So, why is the reheat and cooling energy increase so high? The scheme seems to be working, only 6% of all hours are above 62.5% relative humidity. I think the main problem is that with dehumidification, the cooling coil drops the temperature to 5 deg C (42 deg F) in some cases (see below graph). This seems unreasonable, and may be why there is so much reheat and coling energy, as actual systems would never really drop it below 55 deg F. I don't know how to control this, and I can't find a setpont manager that controls the subcooling routine for the dehumidification.

here appears to be a "!-minimum supply air temperature" field in the "SetpointMnager:SingleZone:Reheat" object set at 13, but it doesn't seem to have an effect.

Is there a way to control this? Am I missing anything?

Here is a link to the .idf in case it helps - https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6aA8ZsOIiibLWpqR1JCbVhyOWs/view

Hi Jacob,
It seems my respond to your question hasn't gone through so I'll repeat it again.

 I think I identified a problem but not the full solution for it. If you check the zone temperature during summer period you'll see that during unoccupied period the zone is cooled down to 15C which is actually your heating setback temperature. To achieve such a low temperature the supply air?has to be sub-cooled to 5C which, as you mentioned, is unrealistic. I cannot source the root of this issue.The partial solution is to control the zone conditions by single heating and single cooling thermostats. As soon as I changed to single cooling thermostat during summer period, the system behaves as it should (supply air temperature around 15C, zone air temperature according to cooling occupied/unoccupied setpoints).?Another possible way of overriding the issue is to replace Fan:OnOff with Fan:ConstantVolume and keep DualSetpoint control. This doesn't completely remove periods when the supply air temperature is around 5C, although it significantly reduces it.I hope you'll find this answer useful.?Best regards,Ivanp.s. I'll post this reply to UnmetHours and Yahoo e+ group as well.

I think Dr. Korolija has hit on the problem. E+, for reheat systems, always
uses the heating setpoint, not cooling setpoint.  It may be that this
reheat system is doing the same thing.
Another simple test would be to adjust summer setpoints for both heating
and cooling so that none of them is below about 24C

Ivan ?

Thanks for the info!  I did get your previous message, my apologies for not responding sooner.

Your answers were very helpful, but as you mentioned they are workarounds.  The single setpoint t-stats are a nice idea, but forcing the building to have a single setpoint thermostat designated for a seasonal period is not ideal.

Additionally, I?ve swapped out the Fan:onoff to Fan:constantvolume as you mentioned, but am getting some strange results.  Can you send me the .idf that you modified?  I essentially changed the fan object?s name and modified the ?Supply fan object type? in the ?Airloophvac:unitary:furnace:heatcool? object. However, when I ran the simulation I got a severe error.  I had to modify the ?Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name? to a schedule that had ?1s? constantly.  I also changed the fan?s availability schedule to the same thing.  Thus, the fan runs all the time.

The EUI jumped up considerably (to 111 kBtu/sf-yr) because of the fan and cooling energy, but both the zone RH looks good and the supply air temperature never goes below 15 deg C.

Here?s an image - https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6aA8ZsOIiibc0ZhSTdDVmtQSVE/view?usp=sharing

Am I missing something?

Hi Jacob,

It seems my respond to your question hasn't gone through so I'll repeat it again.


I think I identified a problem but not the full solution for it. If you check the zone temperature during summer period you'll see that during unoccupied period the zone is cooled down to 15C which is actually your heating setback temperature. To achieve such a low temperature the supply air has to be sub-cooled to 5C which, as you mentioned, is unrealistic. I cannot source the root of this issue.
The partial solution is to control the zone conditions by single heating and single cooling thermostats. As soon as I changed to single cooling thermostat during summer period, the system behaves as it should (supply air temperature around 15C, zone air temperature according to cooling occupied/unoccupied setpoints).
Another possible way of overriding the issue is to replace Fan:OnOff with Fan:ConstantVolume and keep DualSetpoint control. This doesn't completely remove periods when the supply air temperature is around 5C, although it significantly reduces it.
I hope you'll find this answer useful.
Best regards,
Ivan
p.s. I'll post this reply to UnmetHours and Yahoo e+ group as well.

Thanks for the reply!  According to the hourly outputs (currently the simulation is at a ?1? timestep) the relative humidity setpoint is indeed being met 94% of the time, so the system seems to be working well, almost too well for a subcool reheat system if you ask me.

I do expect an increase, and I?m indeed questioning the magnitude of the jump.  I don?t really have much of a frame of reference as research/simulation study material on this is scarce.  The ASHRAE 1254-RP from 2006 is the only thing I?ve seen quantifying the energy effect and effectiveness of commercial HVAC systems and dehumidification.

So my 6% of hours above the RH setpoint and 30% energy increase seems too big.
However, the main reason why I think it?s unreasonable is that I don?t believe that the supply air temperature should ever drop to 5 deg C (41 deg F) to dehumidify.  I think most dx systems won?t go past 55 deg F, but I can?t seem to control this setpoint in Eplus.

Jacob,
I'm  big fan of Output:Variables in E+ and use them liberally to see whether setpoints are met and to get clues about why setpoints are NOT met.
I see that you have a number of them in your IDF; have you evaluated those values against the HVAC controls?

  *   Is the RH setpoint consistently met?
  *   You expect cooling, heating and overall energy to increase with controlled dehumidification (and they did), so are you concerned only with the magnitude of the jump?
I think some review of the energy for depressing discharge air temp to get lower dewpoint, along with confirmation that the heating energy is appropriate, will help you a lot.  You may also benefit from reporting the variables at "timestep" instead of "hourly".

I'm attempting to model dehumidifcation in EnergyPlus and I'm getting some strange results. When using a constant 62.5% Relative Humidity setpoint versus no dehumidification in New Orleans LA, the EUI jumps from 70 kBtu/sf-yr to 91 kBtu/sf-yr.

The project is a 400 square foot classroom "shoebox" that I'm running some infiltration sensitivity analysis on. Thus, I want to make sure I'm capturing the energy impact of dehumidification accurately. I'm using the HVACTemplate:System:Unitary template (everything is autosized), and I've input "CoolReheat" in the "! - Dehumidification Control Type" field. I've added a "ZoneControl:Humidistat" object that uses a compact schedule with a "percent" schedule type limits that uses 62.5 all year. After inspecting the expanded file, the AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool object has a "CoolReheat" designation in the "! - Dehumidification Control Type" and an additional reheat coil appeared. Everything looks good.
So, why is the reheat and cooling energy increase so high? The scheme seems to be working, only 6% of all hours are above 62.5% relative humidity. I think the main problem is that with dehumidification, the cooling coil drops the temperature to 5 deg C (42 deg F) in some cases (see below graph).

In-Reply-To: <SN2PR0601MB768C087B13F72A2446ABBAED0000@SN2PR0601MB768.namprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Message-ID: <5509E67F.60001@gard.com>

The overall logic is:

Determine the supply air temp to meet the cooling setpoint in the 
control zone
Check to see if the humidity setpoint is met, if not go colder until the 
humidity setpoint is met
if this results in cooling the zone below the heating setpoint, reheat 
to the heating setpoint

It's the humidity setpoint that is driving what the cooling coil is 
asked to do.  This is a unitary heatcool system, so it does not operate 
on setpoints per se.  It's responding to the load request in the control 
zone.  It will run the DX coil as much as it needs to meet the humidity 
control requirement.  So, if you raise the heating setpoint, you'll use 
the same amount of cooling plus more reheat. But on the other hand, the 
absolute humidity ratio can be higher for the same RH if the zone is 
warmer, so it will shift from cooling energy to heating energy - hard to 
know which will use more.

Regarding the fan.  The  furnace object fan control is currently set to 
cycle for part of the day and run continuously for the rest of the day:

  outside_air_schedule_compact,                            !- Fan 
Operating Mode Schedule Name

That's why it needs Fan:OnOff.

Hi Jacob,
Replacing an OnOff fan with a constant volume is relatively easy. Just search for Fan:OnOff and replace with Fan:ConstantVolume. In addition to this you'll need to replace?outside_air_schedule_compact, ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?!- Fan Operating Mode Schedule Namewith schedule with positive values (Mike's comment mention this). I used one of your already existing schedules 'Always On Discrete'. Anyhow, you can download the adjusted file from:?https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3HgHZG0Dps8MnlXWmItV29SZ2M&authuser=0
Regarding your comment ("The single setpoint t-stats are a nice idea, but forcing the building to have a single setpoint thermostat designated for a seasonal period is not ideal") I fully agree. I was just briefly testing to spot where the issue is with sub-cooling the zone to heating setback temperature. My idea was to try to replace dual setpoint thermostat with one single cooling thermostat and one single heating thermostat which can be assigned by implementing EMS program. You would not loose Fan cycling energy savings opportunity by this. There was one answer on your question earlier today on E+ yahoo group which mentioned that EMS might be suitable to adjust operational schedules. I did a brief exercise and got (I think) acceptable results.
The procedure for updating your file is following:1. Delete existing ThermostatSetpoint:DualSetpoint and ZoneControl:Thermostat objects
2. Create ThermostatSetpoint:SingleHeating and ThermostatSetpoint:SingleCooling objects
ThermostatSetpoint:SingleHeating,  ? ?H,?  ? ?waterlab_htg_setpoint_compact;? ? ThermostatSetpoint:SingleCooling,  ? ?C,?  ? ?waterlab_clg_setpoint_compact;
3. Create new ZoneControl:Thermostat object
ZoneControl:Thermostat,? ?  thermal zone 1 Thermostat,? ?  thermal zone 1,? ?  ThermostatControlSCH,? ?  ThermostatSetpoint:SingleHeating,? ?  H,?? ?  ThermostatSetpoint:SingleCooling,? ?  C;
4. Create new ThermostatControlSCH which will be modulated by EMS to switch between single heating thermostat and single cooling thermostat
Schedule:Constant,ThermostatControlSCH,ControlType,1;?! Schedule type limits associated with a new ThermostatControlSCH?ScheduleTypeLimits,? ?  ControlType,? ?  0,? ?  4,? ?  Discrete;
 5. Create an?EMS schedule control program which modulates ThermostatControlSCH according to the following control logic: If the Zone Temperature is above the Heating Setpoint set Thermostat Setpoint to Single Cooling, otherwise set Thermostat Setpoint to Single Heating 
EnergyManagementSystem:Sensor, !- Zone temperature????? ZonepTemp,???? Thermal Zone 1,????? Zone Mean Air Temperature;
????EnergyManagementSystem:Sensor,? ????HeatSP,???? waterlab_htg_setpoint_compact,? ????Schedule Value; EnergyManagementSystem:Actuator, ????ThermostatControlSCH_Overwrite,? ????ThermostatControlSCH,? ????Schedule:Constant,? ????Schedule Value;?
EnergyManagementSystem:ProgramCallingManager,???? Overwrite ThermostatControlSCH, ????BeginTimestepBeforePredictor,? ????OverwriteProg;
EnergyManagementSystem:Program,???? OverwriteProg,? ????IF (ZonepTemp > HeatSP), ????Set ThermostatControlSCH_Overwrite = 2, ????ELSE, ????Set ThermostatControlSCH_Overwrite = 1, ????ENDIF;
The file with the EMS program can be downloaded from:https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3HgHZG0Dps8blktVzhnSnFZWTA&authuser=0
I hope this might help you getting more acceptable outputs.

  The overall logic is:
 
 Determine the supply air temp to meet the cooling setpoint in the control zone
 Check to see if the humidity setpoint is met, if not go colder until the humidity setpoint is met
 if this results in cooling the zone below the heating setpoint, reheat to the heating setpoint
 
 It's the humidity setpoint that is driving what the cooling coil is asked to do.? This is a unitary heatcool system, so it does not operate on setpoints per se.? It's responding to the load request in the control zone.? It will run the DX coil as much as it needs to meet the humidity control requirement.? So, if you raise the heating setpoint, you'll use the same amount of cooling plus more reheat.? But on the other hand, the absolute humidity ratio can be higher for the same RH if the zone is warmer, so it will shift from cooling energy to heating energy - hard to know which will use more.? 
 
 Regarding the fan.? The? furnace object fan control is currently set to cycle for part of the day and run continuously for the rest of the day:
 
 ?outside_air_schedule_compact,??????????????????????????? !- Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name
 
 That's why it needs Fan:OnOff.?

 Thanks for the info!? I did get your previous message, my apologies for not responding sooner.   ? Your answers were very helpful, but as you mentioned they are workarounds.? The single setpoint t-stats are a nice idea, but forcing the building to have a single setpoint thermostat designated for a seasonal period is not ideal.  ? Additionally, I?ve swapped out the Fan:onoff to Fan:constantvolume as you mentioned, but am getting some strange results.? Can you send me the .idf that you modified?? I essentially changed the fan object?s name and modified the ?Supply fan object type? in the ?Airloophvac:unitary:furnace:heatcool? object. However, when I ran the simulation I got a severe error.? I had to modify the ?Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name? to a schedule that had ?1s? constantly.? I also changed the fan?s availability schedule to the same thing.? Thus, the fan runs all the time.?   ? The EUI jumped up considerably (to 111 kBtu/sf-yr) because of the fan and cooling energy, but both the zone RH looks good and the supply air temperature never goes below 15 deg C.?   ?

 Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] EPlus Dehumidification Subcooling Temperature Too Low?    ?      Hi Jacob,    ?   It seems my respond to your question hasn't gone through so I'll repeat it again.    ?    ?    I think I identified a problem but not the full solution for it. If you check the zone temperature during summer period you'll see that during unoccupied period the zone is cooled down to 15C which is actually your heating setback temperature. To achieve  such a low temperature the supply air?has to be sub-cooled to 5C which, as you mentioned, is unrealistic. I cannot source the root of this issue.   The partial solution is to control the zone conditions by single heating and single cooling thermostats. As soon as I changed to single cooling thermostat during summer period, the system behaves as it should (supply air temperature around 15C, zone air  temperature according to cooling occupied/unoccupied setpoints).?   Another possible way of overriding the issue is to replace Fan:OnOff with Fan:ConstantVolume and keep DualSetpoint control. This doesn't completely remove periods when the supply air temperature is around 5C, although it significantly reduces it.   I hope you'll find this answer useful.?   Best regards,   Ivan   p.s.

I do expect an increase, and I?m indeed questioning the magnitude of the jump.? I don?t really have much of a frame of reference as research/simulation study material on this is scarce.? The ASHRAE 1254-RP from 2006 is the only thing I?ve seen quantifying the energy effect and effectiveness of commercial HVAC systems and dehumidification.?

Michael ?

Given the overall logic it seems like there is no way to control how much the DX cooling coil drops the temperature.  So if I?m reading your comment correctly you?re saying there is nothing we can do?

It does seem that the heating versus cooling setpoints are causing some issues.  I ran the single thermostat setpoints according to Dr. Ivan and the energy looks much more reasonable.  A 9% increase in total energy, and the RH looks like its being controlled well. So the question still remains, why is the system with the dual setpoint thermostat reverting to heating setpoints and severely dropping supply air temperature?  The system with the single setpoint system never drops the supply air temp below 15 deg C, reheats during the morning to about 19 deg C, and meets both the RH setpoint and summer cooling setback.

Here?s a graph that shows these temperature dynamics between the two cases.

The overall logic is:

Determine the supply air temp to meet the cooling setpoint in the control zone
Check to see if the humidity setpoint is met, if not go colder until the humidity setpoint is met
if this results in cooling the zone below the heating setpoint, reheat to the heating setpoint

It's the humidity setpoint that is driving what the cooling coil is asked to do.  This is a unitary heatcool system, so it does not operate on setpoints per se.  It's responding to the load request in the control zone.  It will run the DX coil as much as it needs to meet the humidity control requirement.  So, if you raise the heating setpoint, you'll use the same amount of cooling plus more reheat.  But on the other hand, the absolute humidity ratio can be higher for the same RH if the zone is warmer, so it will shift from cooling energy to heating energy - hard to know which will use more.

Regarding the fan.  The  furnace object fan control is currently set to cycle for part of the day and run continuously for the rest of the day:

 outside_air_schedule_compact,                            !- Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name

That's why it needs Fan:OnOff.

Thanks for the info!  I did get your previous message, my apologies for not responding sooner.

Your answers were very helpful, but as you mentioned they are workarounds.  The single setpoint t-stats are a nice idea, but forcing the building to have a single setpoint thermostat designated for a seasonal period is not ideal.

Additionally, I?ve swapped out the Fan:onoff to Fan:constantvolume as you mentioned, but am getting some strange results.  Can you send me the .idf that you modified?  I essentially changed the fan object?s name and modified the ?Supply fan object type? in the ?Airloophvac:unitary:furnace:heatcool? object. However, when I ran the simulation I got a severe error.  I had to modify the ?Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name? to a schedule that had ?1s? constantly.  I also changed the fan?s availability schedule to the same thing.  Thus, the fan runs all the time.

The EUI jumped up considerably (to 111 kBtu/sf-yr) because of the fan and cooling energy, but both the zone RH looks good and the supply air temperature never goes below 15 deg C.

Hi Jacob,

It seems my respond to your question hasn't gone through so I'll repeat it again.


I think I identified a problem but not the full solution for it. If you check the zone temperature during summer period you'll see that during unoccupied period the zone is cooled down to 15C which is actually your heating setback temperature. To achieve such a low temperature the supply air has to be sub-cooled to 5C which, as you mentioned, is unrealistic. I cannot source the root of this issue.
The partial solution is to control the zone conditions by single heating and single cooling thermostats. As soon as I changed to single cooling thermostat during summer period, the system behaves as it should (supply air temperature around 15C, zone air temperature according to cooling occupied/unoccupied setpoints).
Another possible way of overriding the issue is to replace Fan:OnOff with Fan:ConstantVolume and keep DualSetpoint control. This doesn't completely remove periods when the supply air temperature is around 5C, although it significantly reduces it.
I hope you'll find this answer useful.
Best regards,
Ivan

Thanks for the reply!  According to the hourly outputs (currently the simulation is at a ?1? timestep) the relative humidity setpoint is indeed being met 94% of the time, so the system seems to be working well, almost too well for a subcool reheat system if you ask me.

I do expect an increase, and I?m indeed questioning the magnitude of the jump.  I don?t really have much of a frame of reference as research/simulation study material on this is scarce.  The ASHRAE 1254-RP from 2006 is the only thing I?ve seen quantifying the energy effect and effectiveness of commercial HVAC systems and dehumidification.  They modeled 17 different system configurations in E-plus for a variety of building types/climates, and reported the hours above 65% RH and the increase in annual HVAC cost. For a DX system w/subcool Reheat for Miami and a 9 month school ------ 2222 hours (25%) of hours are above the RH threshold and this creates an 11% increase in HVAC energy.  So my 6% of hours above the RH setpoint and 30% energy increase seems too big.
However, the main reason why I think it?s unreasonable is that I don?t believe that the supply air temperature should ever drop to 5 deg C (41 deg F) to dehumidify.  I think most dx systems won?t go past 55 deg F, but I can?t seem to control this setpoint in Eplus.

Jacob,
I'm  big fan of Output:Variables in E+ and use them liberally to see whether setpoints are met and to get clues about why setpoints are NOT met.
I see that you have a number of them in your IDF; have you evaluated those values against the HVAC controls?

  *   Is the RH setpoint consistently met?
  *   You expect cooling, heating and overall energy to increase with controlled dehumidification (and they did), so are you concerned only with the magnitude of the jump?
I think some review of the energy for depressing discharge air temp to get lower dewpoint, along with confirmation that the heating energy is appropriate, will help you a lot.  You may also benefit from reporting the variables at "timestep" instead of "hourly".

Hello all!
I'm attempting to model dehumidifcation in EnergyPlus and I'm getting some strange results. When using a constant 62.5% Relative Humidity setpoint versus no dehumidification in New Orleans LA, the EUI jumps from 70 kBtu/sf-yr to 91 kBtu/sf-yr. Cooling energy increased by about 30%, and heating increases by a factor of 5.6!
Image - https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6aA8ZsOIiibQUJSa2g5Z2pnMkE/view?usp=sharing

The project is a 400 square foot classroom "shoebox" that I'm running some infiltration sensitivity analysis on. Thus, I want to make sure I'm capturing the energy impact of dehumidification accurately. I'm using the HVACTemplate:System:Unitary template (everything is autosized), and I've input "CoolReheat" in the "! - Dehumidification Control Type" field. I've added a "ZoneControl:Humidistat" object that uses a compact schedule with a "percent" schedule type limits that uses 62.5 all year. After inspecting the expanded file, the AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool object has a "CoolReheat" designation in the "! - Dehumidification Control Type" and an additional reheat coil appeared. Everything looks good.
So, why is the reheat and cooling energy increase so high? The scheme seems to be working, only 6% of all hours are above 62.5% relative humidity. I think the main problem is that with dehumidification, the cooling coil drops the temperature to 5 deg C (42 deg F) in some cases (see below graph). This seems unreasonable, and may be why there is so much reheat and coling energy, as actual systems would never really drop it below 55 deg F. I don't know how to control this, and I can't find a setpont manager that controls the subcooling routine for the dehumidification.
Image - https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6aA8ZsOIiibQm9rdDNUZFYwS0E/view?usp=sharing

here appears to be a "!-minimum supply air temperature" field in the "SetpointMnager:SingleZone:Reheat" object set at 13, but it doesn't seem to have an effect.
Is there a way to control this? Am I missing anything?

Ivan ?

EMS SYSTEM

Thank you so much for making the EMS system to get around the single setpoint thermostat scheduling issue.  I ran a pre and post case and everything looks good!  There?s a 15% increase in total energy, the RH is being controlled almost perfectly (<1% over 62.5%RH), the zone setpoints look good, and the supply air temperature only drops slightly below 15 deg C during the summer.

Here?s an image of all those variables:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6aA8ZsOIiibbFFNQUU4N0xNYzA/view?usp=sharing

The only thing I?m still having trouble with is that it seems like this is an ?ideal? control. I always thought that systems won?t subcool much below 55 deg F, but this might be a question for the MEs that we work with.  Now at least we?ve got the Eplus system working reasonably.  Thanks again!

FAN ISSUES

Thanks for the info, after running your model with the fan changes it looks like we got the same results.  However, given the huge jump in fan energy from a constantly running fan, it is not a feasible workaround.  I thought you were seeing something that I wasn?t.  Thanks for sending that over!

SINGLE SETPOINT THERMOSTAT

I?m intrigued by the single setpoint workaround.  If you read my response to Michael?s post, you?ll see that I ran it with the single setpoint thermostats and the energy does look much more reasonable.

Here?s an image to some temperature graphs that show the difference between the single and dual setpoint thermostat.  Everything looks good except for the inability to schedule dual setpoints.  But now that the EMS system works, this issue is obsolete.

Hi Jacob,

Replacing an OnOff fan with a constant volume is relatively easy. Just search for Fan:OnOff and replace with Fan:ConstantVolume. In addition to this you'll need to replace
outside_air_schedule_compact,                            !- Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name
with schedule with positive values (Mike's comment mention this). I used one of your already existing schedules 'Always On Discrete'. Anyhow, you can download the adjusted file from:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3HgHZG0Dps8MnlXWmItV29SZ2M&authuser=0

Regarding your comment ("The single setpoint t-stats are a nice idea, but forcing the building to have a single setpoint thermostat designated for a seasonal period is not ideal") I fully agree. I was just briefly testing to spot where the issue is with sub-cooling the zone to heating setback temperature. My idea was to try to replace dual setpoint thermostat with one single cooling thermostat and one single heating thermostat which can be assigned by implementing EMS program. You would not loose Fan cycling energy savings opportunity by this. There was one answer on your question earlier today on E+ yahoo group which mentioned that EMS might be suitable to adjust operational schedules. I did a brief exercise and got (I think) acceptable results.

The procedure for updating your file is following:
1. Delete existing ThermostatSetpoint:DualSetpoint and ZoneControl:Thermostat objects

2. Create ThermostatSetpoint:SingleHeating and ThermostatSetpoint:SingleCooling objects

ThermostatSetpoint:SingleHeating,
         H,
         waterlab_htg_setpoint_compact;
    ThermostatSetpoint:SingleCooling,
         C,
         waterlab_clg_setpoint_compact;

3. Create new ZoneControl:Thermostat object

ZoneControl:Thermostat,
      thermal zone 1 Thermostat,
      thermal zone 1,
      ThermostatControlSCH,
      ThermostatSetpoint:SingleHeating,
      H,
      ThermostatSetpoint:SingleCooling,
      C;

4. Create new ThermostatControlSCH which will be modulated by EMS to switch between single heating thermostat and single cooling thermostat

Schedule:Constant,ThermostatControlSCH,ControlType,1;

! Schedule type limits associated with a new ThermostatControlSCH
ScheduleTypeLimits,
      ControlType,
      0,
      4,
      Discrete;

5. Create an EMS schedule control program which modulates ThermostatControlSCH according to the following control logic: If the Zone Temperature is above the Heating Setpoint set Thermostat Setpoint to Single Cooling, otherwise set Thermostat Setpoint to Single Heating

EnergyManagementSystem:Sensor, !- Zone temperature
      ZonepTemp,
      Thermal Zone 1,
      Zone Mean Air Temperature;

    EnergyManagementSystem:Sensor,
          HeatSP,
      waterlab_htg_setpoint_compact,
          Schedule Value;

EnergyManagementSystem:Actuator,
          ThermostatControlSCH_Overwrite,
          ThermostatControlSCH,
          Schedule:Constant,
          Schedule Value;

EnergyManagementSystem:ProgramCallingManager,
      Overwrite ThermostatControlSCH,
          BeginTimestepBeforePredictor,
          OverwriteProg;

EnergyManagementSystem:Program,
      OverwriteProg,
          IF (ZonepTemp > HeatSP),
          Set ThermostatControlSCH_Overwrite = 2,
          ELSE,
          Set ThermostatControlSCH_Overwrite = 1,
          ENDIF;

After inspecting the expanded file, the AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool object has a "CoolReheat" designation in the "! - Dehumidification Control Type" and an additional reheat coil appeared. Everything looks good.
So, why is the reheat and cooling energy increase so high? The scheme seems to be working, only 6% of all hours are above 62.5% relative humidity. I think the main problem is that with dehumidification, the cooling coil drops the temperature to 5 deg C (42 deg F) in some cases (see below graph). This seems unreasonable, and may be why there is so much reheat and coling energy, as actual systems would never really drop it below 55 deg F. I don't know how to control this, and I can't find a setpont manager that controls the subcooling routine for the dehumidification.

here appears to be a "!-minimum supply air temperature" field in the "SetpointMnager:SingleZone:Reheat" object set at 13, but it doesn't seem to have an effect.
Is there a way to control this? Am I missing anything?

Hi Jacob,
I'm glad you like an EMS solution.?
Regarding the single setpoint thermostat, I haven't seen your file so it's very difficult for me to make any comment. The system behaviour is affected by thermostats setpoint type. If you only applied single cooling thermostat than you would have an issue with zone temperature during heating period. If you created a separate single heating thermostat and assigned it for winter months while the rest of the year was controlled by a single cooling thermostat than you would not cover cooling/dehumid requirements which even appeared during some days in January.
Since EMS is just workaround, could you upload the chart similar to?https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6aA8ZsOIiibbFFNQUU4N0xNYzA/view
 ?but with your original file with no dehumid instead of EMS_no dehumid. The EMS_W/dehumid should remain.?
Cheers,Ivan

EMS SYSTEM  ? Thank you so much for making the EMS system to get around the single setpoint thermostat scheduling issue.? I ran a pre and post case and everything looks good!?

Thanks again!  ? FAN ISSUES  ? Thanks for the info, after running your model with the fan changes it looks like we got the same results.? However, given the huge jump in fan energy from a constantly running fan, it is not a feasible workaround.? I thought you were seeing something that I wasn?t.? Thanks for sending that over!  ? SINGLE SETPOINT THERMOSTAT  ? I?m intrigued by the single setpoint workaround.? If you read my response to Michael?s post, you?ll see that I ran it with the single setpoint thermostats and the energy does look much more reasonable.   ? Here?s an image to some temperature graphs that show the difference between the single and dual setpoint thermostat.? Everything looks good except for the inability to schedule dual setpoints.?

The overall logic is:

Determine the supply air temp to meet the cooling setpoint in the control zone

if this results in cooling the zone below the heating setpoint, reheat to the heating setpoint

It's the humidity setpoint that is driving what the cooling coil is asked to do.? This is a unitary heatcool system, so it does not operate on setpoints per se.? It's responding to the load request in the control zone.? It will run the DX coil as much as it needs to meet the humidity control requirement.? So, if you raise the heating setpoint, you'll use the same amount of cooling plus more reheat.? But on the other hand, the absolute humidity ratio can be higher for the same RH if the zone is warmer, so it will shift from cooling energy to heating energy - hard to know which will use more.?

Regarding the fan.? The? furnace object fan control is currently set to cycle for part of the day and run continuously for the rest of the day:

?outside_air_schedule_compact,??????????????????????????? !- Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name

That's why it needs Fan:OnOff.?

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] EPlus Dehumidification Subcooling Temperature Too Low? ? Hi Jacob, ? It seems my respond to your question hasn't gone through so I'll repeat it again. ? ? I think I identified a problem but not the full solution for it. If you check the zone temperature during summer period you'll see that during unoccupied period the zone is cooled down to 15C which is actually your heating setback temperature. To achieve such a low temperature the supply air?has to be sub-cooled to 5C which, as you mentioned, is unrealistic. I cannot source the root of this issue. The partial solution is to control the zone conditions by single heating and single cooling thermostats. As soon as I changed to single cooling thermostat during summer period, the system behaves as it should (supply air temperature around 15C, zone air temperature according to cooling occupied/unoccupied setpoints).? Another possible way of overriding the issue is to replace Fan:OnOff with Fan:ConstantVolume and keep DualSetpoint control. This doesn't completely remove periods when the supply air temperature is around 5C, although it significantly reduces it. I hope you'll find this answer useful.? Best regards, Ivan p.s.

Jacob, I'm ?big fan of Output:Variables in E+ and use them liberally to see whether setpoints are met and to get clues about why setpoints are NOT met. I see that you have a number of them in your IDF; have you evaluated those values against the HVAC controls?    
   - Is the RH setpoint consistently met?
   - You expect cooling, heating and overall energy to increase with controlled dehumidification (and they did), so are you concerned only with the magnitude of the jump?
 I think some review of the energy for depressing discharge air temp to get lower dewpoint, along with confirmation that the heating energy is appropriate, will help you a lot.?

Message-ID: <CAEj76ttLh31HUo9LegM4vYkFwTYn-oJn6ovqEWVOMx-_MpNrDA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,



We are working on a project where we want to make the building naturally
ventilated as per ASHRAE 62.1-2007


The prescriptive requirements for natural ventilation are as follows:

   - Naturally ventilated spaces must be permanently open to and within 25
   ft (8 m) of operable wall or roof openings to the outdoors, the openable
   area of which is a minimum of 4% of the net occupiable floor area being
   naturally ventilated. (The net occupiable floor area is measured from the
   inside surfaces of the walls, excluding permanently enclosed obstructions
   such as shafts and columns.
   - Where interior spaces without direct openings to the outdoors are
   ventilated through adjoining rooms, the opening between rooms must be
   permanently unobstructed and have a free area of not less than 8% of the
   area of the interior room nor less than 25 ft? (2.3 m?).

We have square floor plate of 1000 square meter. As per ASHRAE 62.1 only
the perimeter area with a depth of 8 meter can be considered as naturally
ventilated space. But we have designed the windows and positioned the
windows in order to encourage cross ventilation and we can show sufficient
distribution of air by doing CFD simulations. Are the CFD simulations
enough to prove that this building is compliant with ASHRAE 62.1 as a
naturally ventilated building?

Thanks for your time.
Hema.

Hema,

It?s been a while since I documented a natural ventilation project for LEED (I?m assuming you are doing this for LEED?), but in the past (LEED-NC v2.2 era), I?ve used annual natural ventilation simulation results (TAS and IES Virtual Environment are a couple of tools that work) to show that both peak and typical natural ventilation air flow rates are SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the requirements if the building used a mechanical ventilation scheme. My impression of CFD is that it is more of a snap-shot in time rather than giving you results across a time-period, so maybe you could demonstrate flow on a peak day and maybe a ?stagnant? day to help present your design. Otherwise I?d recommend presenting results from an annual (or natural-ventilation-season) simulation.

Maybe people who have submitted nat vent designs for review in the more recent past can provide more insight.

Sincerely,

Nathan Miller, PE, LEED AP BD+C ? Mechanical Engineer/Senior Energy Analyst

Message-ID: <25F861E695EA99478F9790869A57C7D41BD9ED4C@catormsx02>

This is more of a LEED question but the task has fallen onto the shoulders of the simulator.

I am trying to determine what areas should be included in the exterior lighting power allowance calculation.

For example, the project site plan clearly shows walkways and parking areas.  There are no specific exterior lights for the walkways, the parking area light poles also light the walkways.  My assumption is that the walkways should not be included in the calculation of the exterior lighting power allowance.  Is this assumption correct?

Another example.  A light over an exit door, with no canopy, also lights the walkway outside the door.  I assume that the this walkway should not be included in the calculation?  It seems to me that also including the walkway and setting the proposed lighting power to 0 Watts would be ?double counting? against the baseline exterior lighting power allowance?

Thanks for your insights!

Happy Friday!



You count surfaces which are illuminated by fixtures on-site.  If a walkway
or potion thereof is *not* illuminated, you don?t count it for allowable
watts.



If more than one surface type is illuminated by a single fixture, I count
both towards the allowable total.  For both of the examples you provided, I
would count the length of linear walkway you (or more specifically the
guy/gal responsible for the lighting design, if it isn?t you) can back-up
as being ?sufficiently illuminated.?



If it makes you feel better on the algebra side, I suppose you could
appropriate input wattage for a single fixture type between the
2+illuminated surfaces based on the relative area, but you aren?t getting a
different result that way.



I do not doubt there is an AHJ somewhere who feels differently on the
matter for compliance matters, but so far in my career I haven?t
encountered one.  Never had an issue on this point with LEED either ?
that?s anecdotal and not a GBCI position statement? just my experience ;).

Hi Hema,

For the last natural ventilation design I had reviewed, Nathan?s suggestions are sensible ? using an annual simulation and bulk airflow modelling within a software such as IES or TAS. Our reviewer requested a further 3-4 steady state CFD simulations using boundary conditions calculated in the bulk airflow model at typical times (including velocities/temperatures at openings calculated based on the same annual climate data used for the energy modelling). These CFD simulations were taken at typical times of the year to show that both mean age of the air wasn?t too high (i.e. that there were no occupied areas that the fresh air was not reaching), and that the temperatures in the spaces as a result of a natural ventilation strategy were not too cold.

Essentially you need to prove that you will achieve the fresh air rates required, without sacrificing comfort and use the CFD to prove the fresh air distribution is acceptable. I wouldn?t say you need to show significantly higher ventilation rates ? in winter this would be a significant energy penalty, and you would expect to meet the minimum standard ? however, due to the un-predictable nature of the wind, we took the approach of proving that the minimum ventilation in the occupied period always exceeded the requirements of a DOAS mechanical system. This was acceptable to our reviewer.

Unfortunately, 62.1-2007 is not a good tool for passive design ? It?s very much a worst case set of criteria.

Hope that helps,
Ed

Subject: [Bldg-sim] 90.1-2010 Section 11 Baseline System modeling question
Message-ID: <25F861E695EA99478F9790869A57C7D41BD9FBDA@catormsx02>

The project is to demonstrate compliance using Section 11 of 90.1-2010.  The proposed building has air-cooled heat recovery chillers that become air-to-water heat pumps when there is no cooling demand.  The plant has natural gas boilers for the coldest days and to bring the DHW temperature up when the heat recovery chillers don?t product high enough temperatures.  The HVAC systems are hydronically heated and cooled.

Is the Condenser Cooling Source Air/None?  Or as most of the rejected heat goes into the heating loop side, is the condenser Water/Ground?

Then 11.3.2.j.2 indicates that the systems that use the secondary heating source type shall be modelled identically in the budget case and the primary heating source shall be used to determine the budget system type.

What does ?identically? mean ? that the heating plant shall be identical?

For example, if one assumes Air/None as the condenser source, then the single zone systems would be System 11, rooftop air conditioner with fossil fuel furnace.  The multi-zone systems would be System 4, packaged rooftop VAV with reheat, hot water fossil fuel boiler.  But if they budget systems are to be ?identical? would the heating plant in the budget case also be heat recovery chillers/heat pumps and boilers?

I am confused.

Hi Chris,

 

As I read this, you have an air-source condenser and the heating system is either heat pump or fossil fuel which depends on which has the higher output capacity.  Your comments indicate the boilers are the primary heating source.  ?Identical?, as I understand it, applies to the equipment configuration.  In your case the baseline will have both heat pumps and boilers, same as the proposed.  In the baseline, for all equipment, the minimum efficiencies apply. In the proposed, the actual efficiencies apply.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] 90.1-2010 Section 11 Baseline System modeling question

 

The project is to demonstrate compliance using Section 11 of 90.1-2010.  The proposed building has air-cooled heat recovery chillers that become air-to-water heat pumps when there is no cooling demand.  The plant has natural gas boilers for the coldest days and to bring the DHW temperature up when the heat recovery chillers don?t product high enough temperatures.  The HVAC systems are hydronically heated and cooled.  

 

Is the Condenser Cooling Source Air/None?  Or as most of the rejected heat goes into the heating loop side, is the condenser Water/Ground?

                                                                                                                                                                                 

Then 11.3.2.j.2 indicates that the systems that use the secondary heating source type shall be modelled identically in the budget case and the primary heating source shall be used to determine the budget system type.  

 

What does ?identically? mean ? that the heating plant shall be identical?

 

For example, if one assumes Air/None as the condenser source, then the single zone systems would be System 11, rooftop air conditioner with fossil fuel furnace.  The multi-zone systems would be System 4, packaged rooftop VAV with reheat, hot water fossil fuel boiler.  But if they budget systems are to be ?identical? would the heating plant in the budget case also be heat recovery chillers/heat pumps and boilers?

 

I am confused.

Dear All,
In few of the climatic conditions we work on doesn't require heating at all. The temperature might go little less than 20deg C in winter but heating will definitely not be installed in the project. For these projects, how do we set the heating set point temperatures so that heating never switches on. we are facing issues especially while modelling VAV with PFP boxes in equest (PIU systems). The base case and proposed case heating and fan energy consumption are highly affecting the final savings results. I am looking to avoid this scenario and ensure heating never switches on, therefore zone fans also do not work.
Please guide.

It all depends on which simulation program you're using, but all of them should be able to 
accommodate you very easily.  You can either set the Heating Schedule to be never on, and 
the Heating Setpoint Temperature to something very low, like 10 C (50 F).

1) Make sure your zoning pattern will not require any reheat. Certain VAV
zones served by the same system may require reheat if the central ahu
supplies much cooler air than what is required by some zones.
2) If there is no heating system in your building you should not include it
in the model. Make sure the heating system is set to Not installed. Then
the heating setpoint does not even matter.

But ASHRAE 90.1 appendix G requires identical heating to be modelled in both base and proposed case. So modelling a setpoint such that heating doesn't switches on is important.But how much ever lesser temperature i model, heating energy consumption is coming down but fan energy consumption is going up due to Zone fans (PFP boxes).

Thank you Joe Huang. I am using Equest for the simulation. Can we set the heating as not installed for LEED submissions?

Hi,
 According to Ashrae 90.1-2007 Appendix G Table 3.1.10 d "Where no heating system exists or no heating system has been specified, the
heating system classification shall be assumed to be electric, and the system characteristics shall be identical to the system modeled in the baseline building design."So you can not set the heating as not installed.

You may try to  set the fan shcedule value in heating season to -1 to force the fans turn off,and the heating will turn off accordingly.

  Exactly. Thats the reason, i want to model such a way that heating never switches on and even the zone fans (PFP boxes) never comes on. I am not able to exactly figure out how to do that?

    Hi,
 According to Ashrae 90.1-2007 Appendix G Table 3.1.10 d "Where no heating system exists or no heating system has been specified, the
heating system classification shall be assumed to be electric, and the system characteristics shall be identical to the system modeled in the baseline building design."So you can not set the heating as not installed.

 Thank you Joe Huang. I am using Equest for the simulation. Can we set the heating as not installed for LEED submissions?

   It all depends on which simulation program you're using, but all of them should be able to accommodate you very easily.  You can either set the Heating Schedule to be never on, and the Heating Setpoint Temperature to something very low, like 10 C (50 F).

   Dear All,
 

 In few of the climatic conditions we work on doesn't require heating at all. The temperature might go little less than 20deg C in winter but heating will definitely not be installed in the project. For these projects, how do we set the heating set point temperatures so that heating never switches on. we are facing issues especially while modelling VAV with PFP boxes in equest (PIU systems). The base case and proposed case heating and fan energy consumption are highly affecting the final savings results. I am looking to avoid this scenario and ensure heating never switches on, therefore zone fans also do not work.
 

 Please guide.

 Rathnashree

Subject: [Bldg-sim] The solution to manufacturing process load for LEED
	energy simulation
Message-ID: <tencent_7E4C4BAE462420B92F602D41@qq.com>

Dear everyone,
 I have found a opinion about the the soultion to manufacturing process load for LEED energy simulation in internet,but I can not confirm if it is correct,does anyone can help me to confirm that or present some different opinions?
  
 The solution is shown as following:
  
 The biggest challenge you will face is in getting reduction for energy savings, as the process energy for your factory also has to be included in the calculation. In some factory projects the process energy itself can go up to 85 - 90% of the total energy. Getting a reduction like 12 - 15% on these might be very challenging. So, first you need to check how much would your process energy for the manufacturing process be. For your energy model, ASHRAE 90.1 does not suggest a baseline value for the factory process, as every factory process would be very different and unique. So, you will need to create a baseline on your own. You may do this by looking at standard processes and equipments used by other chemical factories, set that as a baseline and try to model energy savings through the equipments and processes your project is using. Check if you propose to use high efficiency equipments. This in the end has to be acceptable by USGBC.
 For the energy model, you can consider using a software like IPMVP, which is quite flexible in developing baselines and calculating design case for different types of unique projects. There is also an option for using the default process energy of 25% for your process loads instead of the actual, which might make energy savings more possible.
 Bright task lighting and lower overhead lighting can also help in reducing overall energy for the project.

There are a couple of CIR's (ID# 10291 and #10237) which you can refer to address manufacturing facilities.?

When I had a similar project, we realized early on that the process energy would be so high that savings in other end uses wouldn?t really matter.  Basically we needed to get 10% energy cost savings in the manufacturing process energy in order to meet EAp2.

You then must establish a baseline. The USGBC has guidance on this, but if I remember correctly, you have to find 3 similar facilities designed in the last 5 years that use what would be considered the standard practice equipment.  You average them for your baseline.  I think the details of this are in a CIR.

simulations where the heating system never comes on. You should still use a reasonable

You might also track the indoor temperatures of your proposed building to convince LEED 
reviewers that indoor temperatures are always above the comfort zone.

Message-ID: <01706FE7B334AA499584CFC26A71DEAE2879934D@XSERVER20B.campus.tue.nl>

Dear all,

This is to make you aware of the just opened vacancy: Post-doc - Indoor Climate in a Smart Grid Environment.



This vacancy is positioned within the STW project i-CARE which goal is to optimize the energy demand of (office) buildings in smart grids by exploiting the inherent flexibility of the construction, use and users of buildings. The project will focus on whole building simulation to assess the maximum allowable simplification in reduced thermal modelling of buildings in the intended smart grid application. In addition an assessment is made of the allowed constraints for thermal comfort within the context of current standards and the potential and the need of applying more detailed thermophysiological modelling to assess equivalence of thermal exposure. Finally, in-situ assessment of the thermal exploitation of building mass in the context of smart grids is envisaged. The project will be carried out in collaboration with Twente University and industry partners.



More information about the vacancy and application process is found at

http://jobs.tue.nl/en/vacancy/postdoc-indoor-climate-in-a-smart-grid-environment-213826.html

(Please do not send your application by email but use the submit procedure as indicated on the website)



We would appreciate it very much if you could forward this message to potential candidates.



Thanks in advance,

Marcel Loomans

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE IWEC2 weather data available online for 3,
 012 international locations
Message-ID: <551472DB.9080908@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

ASHRAE's International Weather for Energy Calculations 2.0 (IWEC2) were completed in Dec.  
2011 to provide "typical year" weather files of 3,012 international locations outside the 
US and Canada specifically for use in building energy calculations.

The IWEC2 files were derived from the Integrated Surface Database (ISD), a massive archive 
of weather reports from around the world maintained by the US National Climatic Data 
Center (NCDC). For each IWEC2 location, there must be observations at least four times per 
day of wind speed and direction, sky cover, and dry-bulb and dew-point temperature for 12 
years up to 25 years of record.  In addition, there are also data on atmospheric pressure, 
visibility, ceiling height, liquid precipitation, and Present Weather.

Considerable effort was devoted to deriving hourly solar radiation using the best 
available solar models which are calibrated against measured data from the World Radiation 
Data Center (WRDC). Consequently, the IWEC2 files probably have the most comprehensive and 
reliable weather data possible for these locations.

For a complete list of the 3,012 IWEC2 locations, go to 
http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/IWEC2_locations.txt

The entire set of IWEC2 weather files in CSV format is available at 
http://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/products/1823067 .

ASHRAE, in collaboration with White Box Technologies, also provides instant web access to 
the IWEC2 weather files for individual purchase, sets by country or region, or even the 
entire set, in three formats (CSV, EPW, and BINM).

To see the various online options for IWEC2 weather files,  go to 
http://ashrae.whiteboxtechnologies.com and use either "Search by Google Earth" or "Search 
by List".

Hi Rathna,



It may be worth your time to peruse the CIR archives, or even to further
submit a formal query to GBCI with reference to your specific LEED project
prior to preliminary submission, to find for those specific
climates/regions of the world whether there may be some precedent
supporting your proposition to exclude heating altogether.  The
conservative/safe approach remains to stay the course of modeling heating
in both cases, as prescribed.



Before launching such a query ? I would advise you to revisit your
assertions:  It?s seems rather shaky to simultaneously claim heating isn?t
broadly necessary based on your climate, and to observe space heating and
associated fan energies are a relatively big deal with regard to your
simulation results.



As far as I understand the intent of 90.1, in line with Joe?s suggestion,
the general requirement to simulate space heating for *conditioned**
spaces, even where none is installed, is rooted in the idea that a new or
renovated building should typically be trying to maintain occupant comfort
through all seasons.  If we hang the intent on ?comfort? as the operating
word, it doesn?t take much of a stretch of the imagination to consider
there are occupant demographics, processes, activities, and indeed regions
of the world where the definition of a ?normal? range of temperatures to
achieve comfort diverges from a ?typical? 70-75F during occupied hours.
It?s my general impression, and my practice, to assert the modeler has the
flexibility to assign thermostat setpoints as appropriate to reflect the
actual design, and within reason (i.e. to maintain comfort), so long as
those thermostat setpoints/schedules are held equal between both baseline
and proposed models.



On a related tangent, it?s probably worth a mention:  for LEED 2009
presently, GBCI seems to have pretty much fully adopted the notion to
permit/encourage the use of 90.1-2007 addendum ?dn? (Adding the
?heating-only? baseline systems #9 and #10 as they appear in 90.1-2010),
for the opposite scenario where you have heating only and no cooling in the
proposed design.



With specific regard to application in eQuest, the simplest way to remove
the call for heating *altogether* in many models is to remove the inputs
for zonal heating thermostat schedule assignments (HEAT-TEMP-SCH).  An
intermediate solution would be to modify those thermostat heating schedules
to pull the setpoints downwards, thereby reducing hours where heating is
called for.



Leverage this knowledge prudently ? it?s well within reason to expect your
reviewers to require a full accounting/explanation of your simulation?s
thermostat schedules if the project?s heating energies diverge wildly from
similar projects in that region, especially if heating is missing entirely!



* Take note that  ?*conditioned*? is a 90.1 glossary term ? it?s worth
reviewing where this does and does not apply within your project, if you
are unfamiliar.

Dear All,



In few of the climatic conditions we work on doesn't require heating at
all. The temperature might go little less than 20deg C in winter but
heating will definitely not be installed in the project. For these
projects, how do we set the heating set point temperatures so that heating
never switches on. we are facing issues especially while modelling VAV with
PFP boxes in equest (PIU systems). The base case and proposed case heating
and fan energy consumption are highly affecting the final savings results.
I am looking to avoid this scenario and ensure heating never switches on,
therefore zone fans also do not work.



Please guide.
