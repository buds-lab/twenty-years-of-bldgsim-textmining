Scott,
For the LEED ECB, you have 2 options for energy rates:
1. Use the kWh rate for the state your building is in on pg 144 of the
reference guide (v2.1).
2. If you want to, you can use a specific energy rate for the building,
provided you can show that this is what will be provided for your
building by the local utility company.
 
So for LEED purposes, you could use the flat rate from the reference
guide. Although, if you have a demand rate structure and you are shaving
your peaks in your designed building, the flat rate structure might end
up hurting you.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Utility Rates and eQUEST



I am a new user of eQUEST and am trying to model a building for LEED
energy savings purposes. I am comparing my design building to the ASHRAE
90.1 Code requirements of the same building. 

 

When setting up my electricity rates I can use Block Charges and
Ratchets. If I was able to find an average rate per kWh, how much would
this impact my energy reports? I am concerned that trying to get too
complicated by using multiple types of rates could actually hurt my
model more than help it.

 

Any thoughts would be appreciated

What wound up working was changing the low-safety loop temperature from
45 to 40.  Increasing the flow rate per ton would have helped also.

Hi Grant,

As Jeff says, this is tricky. There seems to be three approaches I've seen
discussed,

1. you can't do it, don't try
2. DOE2 functions
3. schedules

I can't speak to the function approach, which I know others have tried, but
I've had some good success matching billing histories with the schedule
approach. It's a lot of spreadsheet work, but the evaporation can be
calculated and entered as a process load. Conduction can be handled by
creating a dummy zone at the pool temperature. If the pool room temperature
is kept above the pool water temperture, convection and radiation are
relatively minor.

Indoor pools are generally kept at one temperature, and the pool room is
usually a degree or two higher than the main pool temperature.  "the
temperature of the water moderates the air temperature of the zone" which
"affects the load on the HVAC system". Yes, but controls ensure the pool
room temperature remains relatively constant. Humidity control is available
to a PSZ system.

DOE2.2 does not currently model water-water heat exchangers, so you have to
fool around with primary-secondary loops.

A good reference is TRNSYS 144.

Hope this helps,

Hi Grant:

This is something I have been SCREAMING for to add to
DOE2 ever since 2.1C. Indoor AND outdoor pools. I used
to do modeling foe hotels and motels.

I once actually had a outdoor pool usage meter AND
outdoor air to correlate, so tried to pretend a room
was a pool, with the ceiling being the pool surace.

For am indoor pool, perhaps the water could be a
direct process load. I believe eQuest can tie your
pool nantorium to a user input pool load profile,
input as a direct process load.

Hello:

This is tricky...since DOE-2.1e does not really model moisture
conditions, so you can't tell about surface conditions. Also, popular
systems such as the "Pool Pack" HP system cannot be modeled in DOE-2.1e,
and perhaps DOE-2.2. 

However, you can model the coil loads, etc. You'll find some advice in
the paper: Haberl, J., Claridge, D. 1985. "Retrofit Energy Studies of a
Recreation Center",  ASHRAE Transactions-Research, Volume 91, Part 2,
pp.  1421 - 1433, (June), and the technical report on which it was
based. In this work we mimicked the pool load by creating a proxy zone
inside the zone that had all the humidity loads that we estimated with
measured data from the pool at the Rec Center we studied. 

There is also useful information in the FCHART software, including a
list of references that are old but useful, and probably others I'm not
aware of.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Modelling Pool Areas with eQuest & DOE

I am currently modelling buildings with eQuest to simulate proposed 
mechanical retrofits for a Canadian University (to calculate the energy 
savings). My problem is that two of the buildings contain indoor pools. 
The pool retrofits include controls changes to the pool's heating 
converters (steam to hot water), and the pool's circulation pumps. So, I

need to find a relatively accurate way of modeling a pool zone in eQuest

and attaching this equiptment to it.

Does anyone have a good strategy for modeling pool zones in eQuest (or 
simply DOE2)? I need to model:
 - the HVAC system serving the pool area
 - the pool pumps
 - the pool heating converters

To get an idea, the problem is that the temperature of the water 
moderates the air temperature of the zone. This affects the load on the 
HVAC system. In addition, humidity becomes a major factor.

Any discussion on this topic would be great!

Thanks,

Grant Unsworth

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200509291519.AA1924359pd80000802635@gard.com>

I have two questions about the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that
I'm hoping someone can help with.

1. In section 1331, on page 1335 there is a discussion of
   special rules which allow you to receive a reduced tax
   credit for commercial building energy efficiency
   if you can achieve energy savings targets just for
   lighting, HVAC or HW systems rather than for the whole building.
   In item "(ii)" on page 1335 it mentions that the energy
   savings targets will be established by the Secretary (of Treasury?).

   Question: Have these energy targets been published and if so
   in what publication?  If not yet published, where should I be
   watching for their publication?  Federal Register?

2. Later on page 1336, again regarding commercial building energy
   efficiency tax credits, there is a paragraph that states:

   "(2) METHODS OF CALCULATION - The Secretary, after consultation 
   with the Secretary of Energy shall promulgate regulations which
   describe in detail methods for calculating and verifying energy
   and power consumption and cost, based on the provisions of
   the 2005 California Nonresidentail Alternative Calculation
   Method Approval Manual"
 
   Question: Same as before.  Have these regulations have been
   released and if so where they are published?  If not yet
   published, where should I be watching for publication?

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.

I am trying to simulate the use of multiple bio-diesel generators that

Recovery to heat domestic hot water.  Following Example 2 on page 340 of the
DOE22Vol3-Topics manual I created a flag schedule (with 0's and either or
1's to track the load or 5's to run at max) and then used that schedule with
a Utility Electric Meter to operate the generators.  This works fine when
there is only 1 generator.  When I try to do it with 4 generators with
different operating schedules it doesn't seem to work.  Does anyone have any
tips on who to do this?

At the risk of oversimplifyimg the feedback you have received, the
validation studies and tests referred to in other responses are primarily
focussed on the loads a building experiences.  This is important but far
from the whole story.

If your interest is in predicting likely energy use of mechanical systems
then calibrated simulations and comparison reports such as those Jeff Haberl
has referred to are very relevant.  Simulation can predict energy use with
reasonable accuracy provided:
1) the simulation engine can represent your building and its systems
reasonably well; and,
2) the user provides inputs to the simulation that are representative of
reality.

The latter issue will always be an issue.  Buildings that have been
commissioned and controlled poorly could have some simple control changes
made from design intent that lead to a 40%+ difference in energy use.  A
tenant's light and power energy use can change over time and impact the
mechanical services energy use ...

Also be careful if you are using the simulation to try and estimate total
base building or whole building energy use, ensure that you have coverage of
all energy use.  There are numerous systems and equipment that energy
simulation does not account for directly.  As a result some of these systems
are overlooked and do not attract the attention from energy simulation
specialists that they should.

Never accept a single answer from simulation, a likely range is a more
appropriate way to use simulation if your interest is in 'absolute' energy
use.  Unless assumptions are made that account for manufacturer's
tolerances, non-homogenous operational profiles, installation imperfections
and control imperfections, simulation can only provide a theoretical limit
that may be approached but in most cases never reached.

Graham Carter

Scott,
 
You nailed the problem, and your advice was right on! So, the take home
lesson is NOT to include periods in eQUEST project names. Thanks for your
help.

Check the name of your project file.  If it contains a '.' (dot) before the
file extention, such as "Sample Project file ver1.23.pd2", then you should
find that this error goes away by removing the dot within the project
filename.  For some reason, dots within filenames confuse DOE-2 and result
in the truncation of results files, which in turn prevents the eQUEST
interface from being able to find the corresponding simulation results
files.

If this is not the case, e-mail me a zip file continaing the PD2 and INP and
I will take a look.

My model had run previously, but when I went through the zones and plugged

Search for ?gfx? at http://www.eere.energy.gov/
However, I do not know if documents referenced at this site include measured waste water temperature.
Perhaps the inventor of GFX can guide you to this data.

I am wondering if there is enough heat to consider central heat recovery off of the combined drain lines to pre-heat domestic hot water make-up.

 

Any one have history in trying such a heat recovery approach?

There are a number of analytical test results available, for example the ASHRAE 865RP. ASHRAE Standard 140 will be useful as well. The IEA has an Annex with test results from several programs. LBNL also has a number of reports from their MOWITT facility. Comparison reports can also be found from PNNL, NREL, FSEC and many other places.  Our lab has papers on calibrated simulation as well.

Donny,

You may also want to see the IEA SHC Task 22 website at:
www.iea-shc.org/task22
Click on "Outcomes" at the top of the page. Most of the reports there relate
to testing and validation of building energy analysis simulation tools.

Additionally, American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning
Engineers (www.ashrae.org) has published ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 140-2004
"Method of Test for the Evaluation of Building Energy Simulation Computer
Programs".

Dear All,

Apache has a directory of ASHRAE 140 test data to demonstrate compliance. It
provides a brief description of the 140 test building model - basic dims +
permutations of glazing, etc.

However, one omission from the supplementary PDF manual is the details of
the low mass and high mass constructions. Does anybody know this?

Unfortunately, the information services that my company subscribe to do not
supply this document because it falls within the realms of "test data".

Best regards and thanks

Gerald, 

You'll be happy to know that waste heat is free
energy, and yes, you would compare your absorption
heater with a gas unit.  If I recall correctly, a unit
off 100 tons or less would be compared to a single
effect direct fired absorber (probably COP = 0.7),
over 100 tons with a double effect direct fired unit
(COP and IPLV of 1.0).

My inputs:

Using the ECB Method, the budget building does not take credit for
site-recovered energy, but your proposed design building does.

Provisions:
1.  The design energy cost and energy cost budget shall be calculated using:
(a) the same simulation program, (b) the same weather data, and (c) the same
purchased energy rates.

2.  Where on-site renewable or site-recovered sources are used, the budget
building design shall be based on the energy source used as the backup
energy source or electricity if no backup energy source has been specified.

3.  The type of HVAC system (for both the proposed design and the budget
building) is mapped on a 1-to-1 correspondence with one of the 11 HVAC
systems in Fig. 11.3.2 (HVAC Systems Map.)

4.  Lastly, when you do an HVAC design, the HVAC model used in your proposed
design has to be consistent with your design documents.  The budget building
HVAC system has to follow Fig. 11.3.2 and the dozen or so accompanying
notes.

understanding, ASHRAE 90.1 does not allow comparison
of buildings with different system types or different
fuel types.

If this is true, then can a base case model with a
gas-fired absorption chiller be compared with an
absorption chiller that utilizes waste heat? If so,
then can one take credit for the reduction in energy
cost from the former to latter system?

Thanks in advance for your input.
Gerald Pde

Hygroscopic is possible in ESP-r and is dependant on some difficult-to-find
material properties. Be aware the facility expects a high degree of
domain and tool expertise and occassionally dragons have been spotted.

In esp-r internal mass can be explicitly modelled via surfaces floating
within a zone. Such surfaces take part in explicit longwave radiation
exchange with all other surfaces in the zone and take part in the usual
convective exchanges or can use user supplied hc coeff.  Radiation
viewfactors can be either explicitly calculated or based on area-weightings.

Such interior surfaces have mass and will act as thermal sponges. There are
a few rules to follow in defining layers in constructions, but folk have 
worked with mass of 1-1.5m thickness with little or no difficulty. Run times
are longer because of the extended start-up day requirements which
are associated with really massive construction.

Truly clever folk could include phase change properties, but that probably
is not an issue for this sort of constructoin. The limit the the degree of 
internal 'clutter' is largely a function of how many extra surfaces you 
include.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200509210940.AA4016890pd80000794235@gard.com>

Good afternoon one and all,

1. Does anybody know of an IES apache type piece of dynamic simulation
software that can model the hygroscopic effects of building materials? The
job in question is an above ground, thermally massive nuclear waste facility
with very low levels of ventilation. 

   The concrete structure is expected to give off moisture for many years as
part of its cure. I expect that it will also react to internal and external
vapour pressure and act in a hygroscopic manner. Can this be modelled with
ESP-r for example?

   Another interesting feature could be the inclusion of unfired clay for
hygroscopic buffering.

   The results of the thermal analysis feed into the concrete design and are
critical because the concept design of store contains no expansion joints to
avoid radiation "shine paths".

2. In order to model the thermal mass of waste within the store it was
necessary to represent it as "internal partitions". Does esp-r (or any
similar) have the capability to "fudge in" extra thermal mass into a room
space along with any other parameters such as surface area, thermal
transmittance, surface resistance, etc.

Best regards

Chris Yates

A quick reminder before you go changing the inp file.  If you have put any substantial time into the project: make a back up copy of the inp file first.  Other than that, Mr. Sami's solution should do the trick for you.

Paul,
I tried repeating what I just suggested to you, and it turns out that you really cannot fix your problem without going into the inp file. It seems to be some kind of bug in the program, but it will not let you edit it in eQUEST. 

However, changing the inp is simple enough, so it shouldn't be a problem.

Subject: [bldg-sim] eQUEST question - error with construction tab

Hello,

I'm a DOE-2 (mainly VisualDOE) user just getting acquainted with eQUEST.

Has anyone else ever experienced a problem with the construction tab?  I
somehow inadvertently created a "new" construction that titles itself
"Construction", though when looking at the construction detail
window/screen, the "name" is actually blank.  This creates a problem
when I try to run eQUEST simulations...I get an error.

- When opening the file, it says that there is one BDL error.  I see the
error tree screen and it refers to a construction titled "Construction".
I double click on it, the construction tab comes up, I click "done" and
then it tells me there are no more errors.  However, when I run the
simulation, the output file is empty and I do not get the output reports
accessible through eQUEST.  

The inp and BDL files support the fact that there is a construction
error due to the lack of a name...only the command "CONSTRUCTION" is on
the line where it should be  "name" = CONSTRUCTION.

On the construction tab:

- I am not able to write a new name in for the construction.
- I cannot change the specification method.
- I can change the Construction Layers selection.
- I cannot delete the construction.  When I try I get a window that says
that there are no components that exist, but I get "error encountered
searching for keyword assignments."

Does anyone have a suggestion how to deal with this without going into
the inp file?  Or is there a way to manipulate the inp file and then
read it back into eQUEST?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. THanks!

Paul

Interesting problem.
I don't believe there is a way to fix this within the eQUEST user 
interface - unless your project was populated from the wizard and you 
don't mind loosing all changes you may have made in the detailed 
interface since leaving the wizard.  If that is the case, then you can 
simply re-enter the wizard and press the Finish button to re-populate 
the detailed (BDL) model.
If this is not the case, then Brian's suggestion of editing the .INP 
file is the way to go.  You should be able to remove the bogus command 
entry(s) using a text editor and then pull the project back into eQUEST.

FYI - The problem here is a result of BDL (DOE-2's database) not being 
able to handle component names being the same as BDL command names 
(ignoring case).  We are careful to prevent users from naming components 
using "reserved" names or no name at all when creating components within 
the interface, but we do not do the same checking when users edit 
components using the detailed UI tabbed dialogs.
A fix for this will get added to our list and you should find this no 
longer a problem once the next public release is posted.

FYI - "EL#" or "E##" stands for Envelope/Loads # and is used as a prefix 
for all BDL components generated from wizard shell number # (to ensure 
component name uniqueness within BDL).

Paul,
When you open the file and get the bdl error screen, click on the error.
It should open up the construction window that you mention. The name
will be blank - type in a name there. This should fix the error.

The problem is that you created a component without a name. I tried
replicating what you described, and eQUEST will not allow you to do this
while creating the component. You must have accidentally deleted it
while trying to edit it. When you do delete the name, it shows up as
"construction", but will give you the error.

Hope this helps

Paul, 
I would recommend deleting the line in the input file referring to this
construction problem and saving the input file as another name. Then opening
up the new named file in eQuest. But first just try closing eQuest, opening
it up again, then running your file again. Often that works.

- I am not able to write a new name in for the construction.
- I cannot change the specification method.
- I can change the Construction Layers selection.
- I cannot delete the construction.  When I try I get a window that says
that there are no components that exist, but I get "error encountered
searching for keyword assignments."

Does anyone have a suggestion how to deal with this without going into the
inp file?  Or is there a way to manipulate the inp file and then read it
back into eQUEST?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. THanks!

Subject: [bldg-sim] eQUEST question - error with construction tab
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200509201432.AA3227718pd80000970595@gard.com>

Actually, one of the great (and sometimes dangerous!) features of eQUEST is
that all the data entered is stored in the .inp text file.  So you can make
changes directly to the .inp file that will then "show up" when you reopen
eQUEST.  This is helpful for bulk renaming things (like those shell names
the wizard creates -- what is EL1, EL2 etc.?) using search & replace in a
good text editor.

With regard to the specific problem, can you create a new construction?  Are
there any constructions created for the building? (It eQUEST in detailed
data edit mode, not wizard data edit? -- which precludes many changes?)

Subject: [bldg-sim] eQUEST question - error with construction tab

Hello,

I'm a DOE-2 (mainly VisualDOE) user just getting acquainted with eQUEST.

Has anyone else ever experienced a problem with the construction tab?  I
somehow inadvertently created a "new" construction that titles itself
"Construction", though when looking at the construction detail
window/screen, the "name" is actually blank.  This creates a problem when I
try to run eQUEST simulations...I get an error.

- When opening the file, it says that there is one BDL error.  I see the
error tree screen and it refers to a construction titled "Construction".  I
double click on it, the construction tab comes up, I click "done" and then
it tells me there are no more errors.  However, when I run the simulation,
the output file is empty and I do not get the output reports accessible
through eQUEST.  

The inp and BDL files support the fact that there is a construction error
due to the lack of a name...only the command "CONSTRUCTION" is on the line
where it should be  "name" = CONSTRUCTION.

On the construction tab:

- I am not able to write a new name in for the construction.
- I cannot change the specification method.
- I can change the Construction Layers selection.
- I cannot delete the construction.  When I try I get a window that says

If there are a large number of samples, why would the windspeed be
overstated by sampling at 15 minutes before the hour?

FYI. 

You must also enable CWFs, and have properly layered roofs and walls or
the hourly temperature profiles can be meaningless. Even with this it
remains difficult to match meas temps from an attic without manipulating
a proxy variable such as infiltration.

Glenn,

Thank you for the trick. I will try it out. the problem is I don't have
complete data on measured peak attic temperature for all the cases I
want to study, i.e. with different insulation level, different climate
zone, etc.

	Dear All,
	
	I'm using eQuest 3.54 to model a simple 5 zone (perimeter +
core) big box retail building with 4' plenum in Fresno, CA. Roof
insulation = R-11, Wall insulation = R-19. Ceiling is not insulated. not
much glazing.
	
	The following are the findings:
	On hot summer days(outside dry bulb above 100 degree F), when
the rooms are controlled to maintain 75 degree F:
	
	1. with R-11 roof insulation and no ceiling insulation, the
plenum temperature is very close to room temperature( about 2 degree F
higher) during the day.
	
	2. with R-11 roof and R-19 ceiling, the plenum temperature is
5~8 degree F higher than room temperature
	
	3. with no roof insulation and R-19 ceiling, the plenum
temperature can reach 93 degree with outside is 103 degree.
	
	4. in all above 1,2 and 3 cases, the plenum temperature results
from return-air-path = plenum-zones and duct are identical.
	
	I think the actual plenum temperature would be much higher than
the simulation results. Especially in case #3.
	
	Can anybody please tell me what you think about it? What's
causing it?
	
	As a result, the cooling load from the roof being largely
underestimated...

Thank you for the trick. I will try it out. 
the problem is 1). I don't have complete data on measured peak attic 
temperature for all the cases I want to study, i.e. with different 
insulation level, different climate zone, etc.
2). how to handle the reflective roof that reduces radiant heat.

Sorry, I should have made this more clear. 

The "ground temps" that show up when one runs DOE-2 are from Kusuda's algorithm. These are calculated by internally by DOE-2 in the absense of data on the file. These values are also used by default for the water source temperatures for DHW. One can replace either or both of these with real monthly average temps in the input file.

This point was well described by Geoff Levermore in his recent ASHRAE

anemometers vs more accurate ultrasound sensors. This will cause
under-predictions of buildings being analyzed for natural ventilation.

So, until TMY2 files are recompiled with new data, or corrected somehow, we
are all at least using the same bad data. Oh and don't forget the
suspicious ground temperatures,  and as yet to be compiled service water

Jeff,

Thanks.  Do you know of any investigations that have tried to better
quantify the error?   Cutting out below 3-5 mph is not a big problem if
using the data to predict turbine performance because they typically do not

operate below 5-8 mph.

I believe these are derived from NWS measurements, which tend to be 10 meter towers. However, the problem with NWS wind data is that it represents an average of a 3-5 minute snapshot taken 15 minutes before the hour, and thus seriously overstates the integrated average wind speed taken over the whole hour. 

Also, until quite recently,  these were taken with contact anemometers that cut-out below 3-5 MPH, which understates the amount of wind at low wind speeds.

Andy,

The TMY2 wind speed data is measured at about 33ft (10 m) above ground. 

Please refer pp 16.3, Chapter 16, Airflow Around Buildings, ASHRAE 2001. ASHRAE Handbook - 2001 Fundamentals, Atlanta GA.


Best,

Gaurav

You may find LBNL's Therm program to be of some use to understand how
U-Values may change under the influence of 2D flow compared to 1D.  Last
time I used Therm it was steady state thus no ability to account for the
transient dynamics through a thermally massive wall.  Nevertheless you may
find it useful to understand how an extended external surface area may
impact the internal heat transfer and thus effective U-Value - you could
work out your modified extrnal heat transfer coefficient from this.

With regard to some other comments made in this thread, while I cannot speak
definitively, it is my understanding that TAS and Apache handle
inter-surface radiant heat transfer very similarly and that true view
factors are not calculated.  Not having the technical manuals in front of me
I cannot comment further.  The approximations are good for square boxes and
increasingly poor with more complex and non-symmetric geometries.  If my
memory serves me correctly Energy+ also doesn't attempt to calculate view
factors precisely and also uses an approximation.

It would be worth someone clarifying this to avoid mis-information.

Regards,
Graham

Thanks Gunter,

Are you aware of any guidance for adjusting this external heat transfer
coefficient (I assume you mean surface emissivity) to account for such
things as thermal bridging at corners?

I'll take the comments regarding Apache's thermal radiation model on board -
thank you very much.

Dear Chris,

the error caused by the 1-D heat conduction of very thick walls can be
minimized by an adjusted (higher) external heat transfer coefficient.

But be aware of following fact:
The main problem with Apache is that the thermal radiation model is a simple
"mean-radient-model" (like TRNSYS), which is not very accurate, and not a
more sophisticated model based upon view-factors (like ESP-r, Eplus, TAS,
etc.).
Thus the errors induced by the minor radiation model will exceed the errors
caused by restricted 1D heat conduction extensively .......

Gunter

Subject: [bldg-sim] plenum temperature and roof heat transfer using eQuest
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200509161349.AA4906562pd80000789537@gard.com>

Dear All,

I'm using eQuest 3.54 to model a simple 5 zone (perimeter + core) big box 
retail building with 4' plenum in Fresno, CA. Roof insulation = R-11, Wall 
insulation = R-19. Ceiling is not insulated. not much glazing.

The following are the findings:
On hot summer days(outside dry bulb above 100 degree F), when the rooms are 
controlled to maintain 75 degree F:

1. with R-11 roof insulation and no ceiling insulation, the plenum 
temperature is very close to room temperature( about 2 degree F higher) 
during the day.

2. with R-11 roof and R-19 ceiling, the plenum temperature is 5~8 degree F 
higher than room temperature

3. with no roof insulation and R-19 ceiling, the plenum temperature can 
reach 93 degree with outside is 103 degree.

4. in all above 1,2 and 3 cases, the plenum temperature results from 
return-air-path = plenum-zones and duct are identical.

I think the actual plenum temperature would be much higher than the 
simulation results. Especially in case #3.

Can anybody please tell me what you think about it? What's causing it?

As a result, the cooling load from the roof being largely underestimated...

Thanks.

Guo

with CFD-Sims for typical corners of your building and afterwards 
you can adjust the 1-D heatflux of related walls by varying the external 
heat transfer coefficients; for that you can increase the external 
heat transfer coefficient either for convection and/or for
thermal radiation (emissivity of external surface) .....

As a more sophisticated alternative you can also use a simulation tool,
which shows the
facility of 3-D-heat conduction within a wall. As far as I know this
facility is available in the software package ESP-r of Joe Clark, ESRU, ....

Regards,
Gunter

Christopher is correct that most simulation tools default to 1D
conduction. There is, however, the option to turn on 2D and
3D conduction within a model in ESP-r. When this has been used it
has tended to be in the context of external thermal bridges,
but the concept should be applicable to internal portions
of a building (although I know of no one who has reported
trying that). 

It should be noted that 3D conduction implies
additional descriptive detail. Also, such
facilities are typically geared for research use.

Thanks Gunter,

Are you aware of any guidance for adjusting this external heat transfer
coefficient (I assume you mean surface emissivity) to account for such
things as thermal bridging at corners?

I'll take the comments regarding Apache's thermal radiation model on board -
thank you very much.

Dear Chris,

the error caused by the 1-D heat conduction of very thick walls can be
minimized by an adjusted (higher) external heat transfer coefficient.

But be aware of following fact:
The main problem with Apache is that the thermal radiation model is a simple
"mean-radient-model" (like TRNSYS), which is not very accurate, and not a
more sophisticated model based upon view-factors (like ESP-r, Eplus, TAS,
etc.).
Thus the errors induced by the minor radiation model will exceed the errors
caused by restricted 1D heat conduction extensively .......

Dear All,

The thermal analysis package Apache (from IES) is a multi zone model type
analysis package, utilising finite difference methods to model building
performance against weather data. One of the assumptions that it makes is
that heat transfer only occurs between adjacent spaces in a direction normal
to the adjacent surfaces. I believe that this is a common assumption for
most building sim software (e.g. ESP-r).

The assumption holds true for traditional building types with constructions
that are relatively thin when compared to the overall building volume.

However, we are analysing a building with wall constructions that are quite
thick when compared to the overall volume. Common sense tells me that there
will be a substantial 3 dimensional component to heat transfer. 

Does anybody have any experience of modelling the thermal response of
extremely heavyweight buildings that could give me some advice on the
limitations of this type of software (it's a nuclear waste storage
facility)?

It may be possible that this is the preserve of high end CFD, generating
large amounts of transient data with the help of super computing facilities.
However, it is difficult to know this because of the apparent lack of work
done on modelling such facilities.

Facts/ opinions???!

Thank you in advance

Chris Yates

  I am setting up an eQuest sim with a bio-diesel generator used onsite to reduce the load.  I have an operation schedule defined by the electrical engineer that is not 24/7.  On page 342 of the DOE22Vol3-Topics manual there is an example of a 12-hour surplus sale operation sequence that looks like this:

  Gen-DS = DAY-SCHEDULE-PD
  TYPE = FLAG
  VALUES = (0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5, $ 0=don't run
                    5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5, $ 5=maximum output
                    5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) ..

  I couldn't find any reference to the values used in the flag schedule.  Does "5" correspond to running at full capacity as defined in the ELECTRIC-GENERATOR command?  Would values from 0-5 then be part capacity operation?

Shruti,

I think I can answer your questions. 

1. You can specify the static pressure drop of both the supply and
exhaust side of the ERV and eQuest calculates the fan energy assuming
that the main AHU supply and return fans pick up the extra static (this
is the default).  You can also specify dedicated fans for the ERV.  You
find this on the Second Heat Recovery tab.

2. I think the Bypass OA hourly value reports 0 whenever the ERV is off
because eQuest is assuming none of the OA is going through the ERV so
there is no air being bypassed to maintain the temperature control of
the ERV (in other words if the ERV is off, equest assumes it's not
there)

It's not obvious how eQuest does the ERV calculation.  If you look at
the hourly reports and the standard reports the effects of the increased
pressure drop of the ERV only show up in a few places.

The extra pressure drop does not show up in the SV-A report which
summarizes the fan system characteristics, nor does the extra fan energy
show up in the hourly report values of Supply Fan kW and Return Fan kW.

You can see the added fan energy in the monthly breakdowns in the SS-L
report but not in the breakdown of annual fan power usage in the same
report.

There is also an ERV report that gets included in the SIM file whenever
an ERV is simulated.  This report appears after the SS-N report for the
system with the ERV.  The report is NOT included in the report list
drop-down-box included with the D2SimViewer so you need to scroll down
past the SS-N report to find it.

Maybe one of the DOE2.2 folks could explain a little better how the ERV
is simulated and how the results get reported. 

Just be careful when you're calibrating the model and don't get
frustrated if it looks like its not working.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Energy Recovery in eQUEST

We have modeled a 100% OA AHU system with Energy Recovery in eQUEST
based on 
the following control mechanism.

Enthalpy Wheel type- recovering both sensible and latent heat,
Operating mode - both heat/cool,
Make up air temperature control- Mixed Air Reset
Capacity Control- Bypass OA
Operation-OA Exhaust DT
OA/Exhaust DT- 5degF

As stated by others previously, the energy savings potential can vary 
markedly depending on the effectiveness of the control sequence. An ERV
that 
operates continuously can incur a significant fan energy penalty. In 
addition, it may recover heat when the heat is not needed, thereby 
increasing cooling energy. A properly controlled ERV may prove to be
cost 
effective, while the same ERV improperly controlled may actually
increase 
energy usage and cost.

The questions are:

1. To relieve the static pressure drop (not to provide control), a
bypass 
damper has been incorporated into the design on both the exhaust and
supply 
decks.  Intention is for the damper to open when the energy recovery is
off, 
thereby reducing the static pressure drop.  How should one model the
bypass 
dampers to accurately account for the static pressure relief...
perhaps a 
schedule of pressure drop or fan energy tied to the ERV status?

2. Also hourly reports obtained from the current model for " ERV
fraction of 
OA bypassed around the HX ". Indicate a fraction of air being bypassed
when 
the ERV is on, however it gives a value of 0 when the ERV is off, which 
should not be the case. The fraction of OA being bypassed should be 1
when 
the ERV is off. What could be wrong? Any thoughts or suggestions?

This perhaps adds onto the previous thread of in-depth discussion on
Energy 
Recovery, but having been through the Bldg-sim archive and the DOE 2
manual 
we have not been able to find an answer to the above issues. Any
direction 
would be really appreciated, either in the modeling inputs or using post

processing to get the Energy Recovery with bypass dampers to show
accurate 
savings.

Thanks

Thanks for all your inputs,
The fancoil system which was defined is a four pipe,
and I suspect that the chilled water loop is always
loaded to provide space cooling whenever necessary.
And I also suspect that the loop in standby model  was
providing for constant flow within the loop thus the
absorbtion chiller need to be cooling all the time to
supply a constant cooling flow within the loop. I
changed the loop operation control to "demand" instead
of "standby" which was previously defined and that
solved the problem.
Thanks again,
Gerald

Gerald,
I would be suspicious of the loop or the chiller itself.  Check to  
make sure that (for a 2-pipe system) that the 3-way valve isn't stuck  
at a minimum setting and sending some water to the chiller in  
winter.  You might also try using a time or temperature schedule to  
make the chiller unavailable in winter.  I hope this helps.

I have a generic single zone space which I am trying
to model eQUEST. The air-side is a fan coil unit and
the chiller is an absorption chiller which rejects
heat to a colling tower and a boiler that provides the
cooling. Most values are equest default values. Maybe
I am missing out something, but I haven't been able to
figure out in any of the simulation why I am getting a
significant cooling load in winter. I have tried to
find this out by removing all space loads and outside
air loads, but I still get cooling in winter. I know
its because of some system element which I am not
understanding. I tried this with a few system types,
like VAV, or single zone reheat and it was still
giving cooling energy.I tried removed all loads and
cooling potential, and there was a constant chunk of
space cooling energy in the system all the year round.
I know this cannot be any kind of space cooling and
has to be from some other source.  Can anyone enligten
me as to where this space cooling is comming from?
Your inputs are appreciated.
Gerald

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200509081442.AA4228140pd80000781996@gard.com>

Hi, 

 

I am trying to model a Ground loop heat exchanger using eQUEST.
Obviously, I am going wrong somewhere, because the energy use in the
building is going up by almost 20kbtu/sqft/yr as against a variable
volume system, which in reality should actually go down.

I am modeling the GLHX along with a fluid cooler. I notice that the vent
fan energy and cooling energy go up drastically although heating energy
is reduced to almost nil.

Has anyone any experience with modeling a ground source heat pump in
eQUEST? And can tell me where I might be going wrong?

 

Thanks

 

Regards

Alpana

I have a residential apartment situation where heating
and cooling is provided by fan coil units which
recirculates air within the apartment. There is a
seperate make-up air unit which supplier ventilation
outside air at room temperature. The system is set up
such that the room side VAV box is set at a static
pressure where when the kitchen exhaust is turned on
it draws in air from the OA unit.

Any ideas on how to simulate this control system?
Your inputs are appreciated.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200509011118.AA1824515pd80000775872@gard.com>

Pedro,
I am not certain, but I suspect that the large cooling capacity is for dehumidification of (outdoor) air at design wet bulb temperatures, in addition to the sensible load.  If the energy recovery is anything but an enthalpy wheel, it is unlikely to provide any latent capacity.  So the energy recovery may not help dehumidify, and the air may need to be "wrung out" with the large cooling capacity, and then reheated -- hopefully not with primary energy!  I realize this may raise more questions than it answers, but I thought I'd contribute this thought anyway.

We have developed a TRNSYS building model of a real yet existing building in Jaen (Spain) in order to study different ways to operate the HVAC systems for improving energy efficiency. We are now working in the summer mode (cooling) that is much more important due to Jaen climate.
The HVAC systems are divided in two groups: first, several AHUs that provide a constant volume of conditioned outside air at 21?C; second, each room has its own fancoil units so that when a user goes into a room, he turns on the fancoils to get the confort temperature.
We have tried to turn off the AHU's coils so that the ventilating air is now entering at the outside temperature minus some degrees due to the effect of energy recovery equipment. The model shows that the fancoil units still have enough capacity to provide the confort temperature in the occupied rooms. The unoccupied rooms are now hotter so that the mean temperature in the building has increased. This means that the energy comsuption has decreased.
It seems to be very simple but we have no experience about. Do you think there could be any problems by operating the system in this way? Why have the designers installed a so big amount of capacity in the AHUs?
Thanks for your suggestions,
Regards,

Sir:

You got my interest.

I do not know the makeup of your simulation run, but
the 2.1E Maual, page C-155 states that, if you have
energy storage tanks, PS-B and BEPU (actually look
under BEPS) reports the energy differently.

Otherwise, we will need to know the systems and
central plant type you are running, to better
understand where the difference may lie.
