  Dear Friends,

I am facing some problem in eQUEST with date of the computer. Somehow my

I haven't designed any film studios, so I can't speak to the magnitude
you should expect, but I've run across theatrical/heavy retail
situations wherein transformers for low-voltage lighting are grouped
into a remote enclosure located in a utility/data closet - those would
be a significant load that you might call a lighting/process load, even
if there aren't any lights explicitly in that closet - that's where a
large fraction of the heat would be generated/dissipated...

For further reading - an example provider of the equipment I'm talking
about is qtran:  http://www.q-tran.com/

Does anyone have experience with studios which have have equipment,

Does it make sense to have up to 400 w / sf for data closets and rack

Message-ID: <7F7FF64673C26D4DA4A62094657BD91403F59167F1@wattsexch.wattsae.local>

I have been struggling with this scenario.  A pump room does not need to exceed 104F.  Lake water is used for cooling.  The room is expected to contain internal loads requiring cooling at almost all times.  Below 55F the OA and RA modulate to provide 55F supply air.  Above 55F, 100% OA and the cooling coil turns on.  I have the cooling Tstat set to 90F and cooling coil available at 55F.  I am unsure how to even model Below 55F except for economizing which is not really exact but when I set the economizing low limit to 55F I get 200F in the space.  I have set economizing to 90F integrated with the coil and no low limit.  The cooling coil is rarely used and not needed in its full capacity yet I am getting inadequate cooling warnings.

The Min-Supply-T is set to 55F because supply should not be less than this and hourly reports show acceptable supply temperatures into the mid 70s (I don't know if this is acceptable to the program?)  I am not using a lake water chiller because I am not trying to use the same coil temperature.  I am using a simple packaged single zone with the cool-control range set to max and EIR zero'd because there is enough force off the main header to not need any pumping through the loop.

This is only for energy code compliance and I need an explanation on the warnings.  Other than stating several obvious limitations I don't really understand why this warning is occurring.  Does anyone have suggestions on how I may model this system?

I understand that electronic files would help and I will work on that.

Thank you.

Hi Kevin,

 

I see this kind of warning a lot.  The warning usually comes from the
design load calculations, not from the simulation of actual hourly
requirements.  As long as the thermal zone in question does not have any
(or minimal) unmet load hours (check your SS-R report), there is no
worry.  For code compliance, I would use the SS-R report showing the
lack of unmet load hours as a justification that the unit is in fact not
undersized.

 

I hope this helps.  Have a nice day.

  Chris-

One thing to keep in mind regarding eQUEST/DOE-2's "natural ventilation" 
model, is that it is based on the Sherman-Grimsrud method, which was 
specifically developed for estimating envelope infiltration in smaller 
(1-3 story), single-family structures.  Below is a link to a copy of the 
original report outlining the method.  The report gives some good 
background on other infiltration models, and the context in which the 
model was developed (incl. comparison to measurements).  As described in 
the report and the DOE-2 help manuals, you will find that many of the 
model inputs are specifically relevant to small houses.  Finally, in the 
authors own words (p. 4), "this report introduces an infiltration model 
that sacrifices accuracy for versatility and simplicity."  Therefore, in 
my opinion, using this model, especially for larger structures, has a 
good potential for giving misleading results.

gundog.lbl.gov/dirpubs/10852_ShermanGrimsrud.pdf

Unfortunately, DOE-2's "S-G_NV" method is the only NV model _readily_ 
available in eQUEST.  By readily available, I mean you can select it and 
enter inputs within the detailed or other BDL interface, and many of the 
inputs have defaults.  However, just based on my experience in 
estimating the inputs for three of the DOE-2 "nonresidential" 
infiltration methods (AIR-CHANGE+AIR-CHANGES/HR, 
AIR-CHANGE+INF-FLOW/AREA, and CRACK), these models can be quite 
sensitive to inputs, including those in the SITE-PARAMETERS, and finding 
estimates of these inputs for large buildings in literature is 
difficult, if they even exist at all.   I have not had the opportunity 
to compare the S-G_NV model with another NV model for larger buildings 
(such as CFD), but I would guess that if they are close, it would be 
mostly luck that you picked the correct S-G_NV inputs.

I have modeled a couple nonresidential buildings that attempt to use a 
NV strategy to offset mechanical cooling needs.  However, to be 
conservative, I often only accounted for an expanded comfort range 
(similar to what Timothy described) rather than trying to use the 
DOE-2's S-G_NV method.  Although I think some buildings are 
well-designed to take advantage of NV, in my mind, unless you have some 
sort of mechanical controls to open windows, all bets are off.  Not that 
there aren't some real potential energy savings with well-designed NV 
strategy, its just that the methods for estimating the impacts w/ 
eQUEST/DOE-2 are not sophisticated enough.  Anyone out there have any 
evidence or comparative modeling that indicates otherwise?

After doing a lot of thinking about modeling NV, one idea for a 
"work-around" that accounts for NV using eQUEST, is using custom LOADS 
(infiltration) / SYSTEMS (availability) schedules and other inputs based 
on pre-processing of weather and building geometry data (may require 
some iterative runs...). I would guess that the majority of NV impacts 
are from wind-driven infiltration through windows.  Along these lines, 
below is a link 
<www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/...reports/PNNL-18898.pdf>to a 
PNNL paper that describes how to develop E+ "wind-driven" infiltration 
model inputs (basically the same as DOE-2 "AIR-CHANGE" method) using 
local wind pressure coefficients and a design infiltration rate (leakage 
@ 75Pa).  For combination wind+stack driven air flow through windows, 
the model would likely have to get more complicated, but pre-processing 
to calculate DOE-2 inputs gives you a lot of flexibility in what you 
account for...

I have not actually had the opportunity to develop this kind of method 
yet, but I hope to get a project where the design (and budget) justifies 
this level of analysis.  With any type of work-around, I would plan to 
do some sort of validation with another model, such as CFD, or a 
calibration exercise, but these approaches for validating NV open other 
cans of worms...

Anyone have any experience with validating the NV model (or your own) 
that exists in the one of the available building energy simulation 
programs?   Any other ideas for "work-arounds"?  Has anyone gotten 
feedback from reviewing bodies (GCBI, utilities, code reviewers) on the 
use of DOE-2's "S-G_NV" method?

If the problem really is rooted in a mis-match between the files' "last

Dear colleagues,

 

Some of you might be interested in a new Radiance/Daysim plug-in that we
have developed for the Rhinoceros - NURBS modeling for Windows
application. The plug-in, called DIVA-for-Rhino, supports a series of
performance evaluations including:

 

- Physically-based scene visualizations (Radiance)

- Annual radiation maps (Radiance/GenCumulativeSky)

- Climate-based daylighting metrics (Daysim)

- Glare analysis (Evalglare)

- LEED IEQ Credit 8.1 compliance (Radiance)

 

The plug-in offers a highly optimized simulation workflow within
Rhinoceros and can be combined with parametric Grasshopper scripting in
order to generate animated Radiance/Daysim simulations.   

More information can be found at
www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/ABPS.html. You can download the
plug-in from www.diva-for-rhino.com.

 

Happy simulations!

 

Christoph Reinhart, Alstan Jakubiec, Kera Lagios and Jeff Niemasz

Message-ID: <4A015401026CF44ABCC4D2A6A467AA1863A3CF@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I've asked this question before, but never really got a good answer, so
I'm trying again in case anyone has new info.

 

Has anyone successfully submitted a LEED v3 Core and Shell Energy Model?

 

Under v2.0, there was a LEED-CS EAc1 calculator explained here:

 

https://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=6926

 

Spreadsheet link:

 

http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=6927

 

It was a great way to subtract out energy loads that the Owner/Developer
did not have control over.

 

However, under the new v3 Green Building Reference guide (includes NC,
CS, etc), they appear to have gotten rid of the sliding Developer/Tenant
scale, and now award just a different quantity of points for CS vs NC.
It certainly looks that way, and the v3 online template couldn't
possibly be more confusing to me, so I can't really tell by looking at
that.

 

Is this true?  If so, it's a shame, because if you have a Core and Shell
project where there is an Owner requirement to provide a mechanical
system capable of supporting 5 Watts / sq ft tenant plug loads, you can
no longer back out the plug loads as an energy consumer "not controlled
by the Owner/Developer".  I could reduce the plug load density to help
shrink the numerator/denominator, but that's not really an accurate
thing to do in a C&S project, since the Developer HAS to provide cooling
for 5 W / sq ft because of things like SFOs, specific tenant
requirements, etc.  C&S projects are a completely different animal than
an NC project where you already know and can guarantee tenant loads.

 

That sucks.  Can anyone confirm?

James, 

 

I have nothing constructive to offer, except to:

1.       Copy this query over to [Bldg-rate], which has less overall
activity but a pertinent and distinct group of subscribers from
[bldg-sim] - you may get additional useful input via that list.

2.       Agree wholeheartedly with the subject line.

 

Actually, I might strike "CS" and just lump all of LEED v3 into there
=).  I expect I'm not the only one (blindly?) hoping the leadership
within GBCI/USGBC are actively steering us towards a day where LEED
documentation, and EAc1 with its prereq's in particular, can be a
relatively less time/patience-consuming experience for everyone
involved.

 

Best of luck - I'll look forward to reading some better responses than
this one!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] why does LEED-CS EAc1 documentation have to be so
@#%^$confusing?!

 

I've asked this question before, but never really got a good answer, so
I'm trying again in case anyone has new info.

 

Has anyone successfully submitted a LEED v3 Core and Shell Energy Model?

 

Under v2.0, there was a LEED-CS EAc1 calculator explained here:

 

https://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=6926

 

Spreadsheet link:

 

http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=6927

 

It was a great way to subtract out energy loads that the Owner/Developer
did not have control over.

 

However, under the new v3 Green Building Reference guide (includes NC,
CS, etc), they appear to have gotten rid of the sliding Developer/Tenant
scale, and now award just a different quantity of points for CS vs NC.
It certainly looks that way, and the v3 online template couldn't
possibly be more confusing to me, so I can't really tell by looking at
that.

 

Is this true?  If so, it's a shame, because if you have a Core and Shell
project where there is an Owner requirement to provide a mechanical
system capable of supporting 5 Watts / sq ft tenant plug loads, you can
no longer back out the plug loads as an energy consumer "not controlled
by the Owner/Developer".  I could reduce the plug load density to help
shrink the numerator/denominator, but that's not really an accurate
thing to do in a C&S project, since the Developer HAS to provide cooling
for 5 W / sq ft because of things like SFOs, specific tenant
requirements, etc.  C&S projects are a completely different animal than
an NC project where you already know and can guarantee tenant loads.

 

That sucks.  Can anyone confirm?

Hello All,

 

I am currently working on several process intensive buildings. The
mechanical systems and corresponding control strategies that are being
designed are ideal for achieving 30%-40% savings in a standard office
building but I'm afraid that the common denominator, the high process
loads, will significantly reduce my projects savings. Has anyone
successfully submitted for a reduction in process load. If so, what/how
did you document the reduction?

 

Thanks for your time.

We have documented this on two projects - in both cases we had to
document what the industry standard for the process would be and then
how ours was more efficient.  One was related to conveyor energy usage
and the process integrator documented the expected savings based on
numerous other installations they had done over the past few years.  The
second one was the process energy associated with refrigeration -
through team member networking we surveyed approximately 200 owners of
buildings of a similar scope and use to document the baseline
refrigeration system that a building of that type would use.  Then we
documented how our system was different and more efficient.

 

In both cases this was approached with the alternative calculation
methodology of ASHRAE 90.1 and that section of the LEED template.  Hope
that helps!

Jeremy,

Did you file a CIR and get approval from USGBC before pursuing this, or did you just assume USGBC would accept your logic?  From where I was raised, modifying process loads is forbidden territory.  I'm thinking it would be best to get CIR approval first.

Glad this worked out for you though.

Chris,

 

Attached are two documents that deal with the "rules" of modelling and
setting up the MNECB reference case.  The first describes the MNECB
reference building and contains useful info on schedules.  The second is
the new LEED Canada 2009 modelling guidelines applicable for both MNECB
and ASHRAE paths.  The EMA document is helpful in that it highlights
what reviewers focus on.

 

Cheers,

Luka

Firstly,

to everyine who responded to my question regarding a document mentioned in
the LEED Canada 2009 Reference Guide specifically titled "LEED Canada 2009
Energy Modeling Rules"...thank you for all your responses however it appears
the document in question has not yet been published. This is not the EE4
modeling guidelines or the IBPSA modeling guidelines or any other
guidelines. The title is specific.

Secondly,

I have a question regarding external deck areas for restaurants. If I have a
restaurant with and external area which is not conditioned in the design but
has considerable occupancy relative to the internal area of the restaurant
does this need to be treated as a conditioned space regardless. Has there
been a CIR relating to this question?

Thank you for your help as always.

Chris,

 

Did the CaGBC tell you this document is yet to be published?

 

Despite the specificity of the title referenced in the Guide and
considering how long it took for the new modelling guidelines to be
developed, I doubt another document will be developed in addition to the
one I attached in my previous email.  

 

Perhaps a member of the EA TAG could comment on this.

Team,

The project shows the following energy consumption/cost distribution 
details.
Space Cool - 27%
Heat Reject. -1%
Vent. Fans -9%
Pumps & Aux.-6%
Ext. Usage -0%
Misc. Equip.-38% (office equipment's, lift,elevators, fire water pumping 
system loads,etc)
Area Lights -19%
Question1:-
The proposed  model shows savings in all areas except Misc equipment's. 
However we are not getting the required savings due to large Misc 
equipment loads. 
We are thinking of altering the schedule of Misc equipment by providing 
some control logic/best practices to get the required savings. 
Is it acceptable ? If yes, what needs to be done in terms of 
documentation?.

Question2:-
Is it acceptable by the LEED if the process/misc energy is kept at 25% 
irrespective of actual Misc loads?.

Thanks for your valuable input.

Regards,
Kathiresan

Jeremy,
 
Did you file a CIR and get approval from USGBC before pursuing this, or 
did you just assume USGBC would accept your logic?  From where I was 
raised, modifying process loads is forbidden territory.  I?m thinking it 
would be best to get CIR approval first.
 
Glad this worked out for you though.

We have documented this on two projects ? in both cases we had to document 
what the industry standard for the process would be and then how ours was 
more efficient.  One was related to conveyor energy usage and the process 
integrator documented the expected savings based on numerous other 
installations they had done over the past few years.  The second one was 
the process energy associated with refrigeration ? through team member 
networking we surveyed approximately 200 owners of buildings of a similar 
scope and use to document the baseline refrigeration system that a 
building of that type would use.  Then we documented how our system was 
different and more efficient.
 
In both cases this was approached with the alternative calculation 
methodology of ASHRAE 90.1 and that section of the LEED template.  Hope 
that helps!

Hello All,
 
I am currently working on several process intensive buildings. The 
mechanical systems and corresponding control strategies that are being 
designed are ideal for achieving 30%-40% savings in a standard office 
building but I?m afraid that the common denominator, the high process 
loads, will significantly reduce my projects savings. Has anyone 
successfully submitted for a reduction in process load. If so, what/how 
did you document the reduction?
 
Thanks for your time.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimJXA=6WuvLePOfseBEZhz9B3FOoQA5ZXTKVpv_@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

I am currently developing in my PhD thesis a framework towards the
integration of multiple thermal simulation tools in the architectural design
process. Most tools that will be used are already defined and,
unfortunately, the most influent criterion in the selection process was
the affordability of these tools. In the category of energy/thermal tools, I
am planning to use DesignBuilder, which I have been using for 3 years
(besides, I already have purchased a student license).

I wonder if it would be interesting to include in my range of energy/thermal
tools the IES-VE program. It seems an interesting tool that fits well in my
research requirements, but I'm not sure if it is worthy to purchase it (as I
already have the license of DB). Unfortunately, I am not able to purchase
the student version because my University does not have a maintenance
contract with the company. Therefore, I would like to know from users of
these tools or experts in the field which features of IES-VE are not
properly covered by DesignBuilder (and vice versa).

Any guidance is highly appreciated.

Best regards,
Raoni Venancio

Message-ID: <4C601EA3.8020103@transsolar.com>

To Whom It May Concern:

We are working with a 2-layer glass, running under DIN EN410 
environmental conditions.  Calculations execute successfully in both the 
Glazing System library view and the Window Library view.  However, 
Window5 either crashes or gives the non-convergence error whenever I try 
to generate any report in either library view.  I have attempted to 
decrease the window height per instructions 
<http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/52/NonConvergence.html> noted on 
the LBNL website for this bug, but I am still unable to generate the 
report.  It does generate reports when running with NFRC environmental 
conditions, but we need the report generated for DIN EN410 conditions 
specifically. 

The details are as follows, screenshot below:
Glass 1 is SB70XL, with coating on layer 2
Gas 1 is Argon
Glass 2 is a custom laminate with 70% white frit. (Note: a similar 
glazing system with 10% frit generates reports with no errors...)



Thank you!

Dear Raoni

 

Personally, I?d find it strange if you were covering the integration of
simulation tools/packages in your phd  and you didn?t cover IES as well as a
myriad of other tools to be perfectly honest.

 

If I was an external examiner that?s the first area I?d be looking as to why
you didn?t?

 

IES/TAS/ESP-r/IDA ICE/ DOE-2/Equest are the ones I think you must cover as
well as DesignBuilder/EnergyPlus as a minimum.

 

Cheers

Paul

Raoni,

 

It sounds like you may have already settled on two packages, but I'd like to constructively second Paul's reaction of "huh?"  

 

If budgetary concerns are a problem (they always are for post-graduate research), I would consider:

(1)    Any commercial entity should consider giving you some kind of free license for a limited period considering the nature of your research and how your access will allow you to identify their offerings' strengths, potentially generating them sales.  To that end, you might consider refusing any "gifts" for unlimited access, lest your work should become biased.  

(2)    A number of extremely powerful tools (including ESP-r and DOE2/eQuest in Paul's list below) are "zero-cost" to the end user.  You might need a more compulsory reason than your budget to not include them in your research.   "Learning curve" / "time available" may be perfectly valid reasons...  It sounds like a broad subject you've chosen to pursue anyway, and you will ultimately need to narrow what you are and aren't covering if you have any kind of deadline in mind!

(3)    There are a lot of other software packages and tools out there at low-to-no cost... for your research, you might not want to skip over task-specific tools such as DAYSIM or the combination of Google Sketchup and the corresponding IES-VE sketchup plugin (notably, all free).  You might peruse this site for some additional ideas: http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/subjects_sub.cfm

 

Finally, whether you choose to formally publish or not, consider sharing your final work on these lists when all is said and done - you'll might find a receptive audience on such a topic!

Dear Raoni

 

Personally, I'd find it strange if you were covering the integration of simulation tools/packages in your phd  and you didn't cover IES as well as a myriad of other tools to be perfectly honest.

 

If I was an external examiner that's the first area I'd be looking as to why you didn't?

 

IES/TAS/ESP-r/IDA ICE/ DOE-2/Equest are the ones I think you must cover as well as DesignBuilder/EnergyPlus as a minimum.

 

Cheers

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DesignBuilder x IES-VE

 

Dear colleagues,

 

I am currently developing in my PhD thesis a framework towards the integration of multiple thermal simulation tools in the architectural design process. Most tools that will be used are already defined and, unfortunately, the most influent criterion in the selection process was the affordability of these tools. In the category of energy/thermal tools, I am planning to use DesignBuilder, which I have been using for 3 years (besides, I already have purchased a student license). 

 

I wonder if it would be interesting to include in my range of energy/thermal tools the IES-VE program. It seems an interesting tool that fits well in my research requirements, but I'm not sure if it is worthy to purchase it (as I already have the license of DB). Unfortunately, I am not able to purchase the student version because my University does not have a maintenance contract with the company. Therefore, I would like to know from users of these tools or experts in the field which features of IES-VE are not properly covered by DesignBuilder (and vice versa).

 

Any guidance is highly appreciated.

 

Best regards,

Raoni Venancio

Dear Paul,

I appreciate your input. The purpose of my framework is to provide support
to the solution of design dilemmas that arise along the design process. The
focus, therefore, should be on which design information is
relevant/available to solve specific design dilemmas and how simulation
models can be simplified to make assessments faster and easier (the idea is
to make designers to do these assessments). Such method should also
stimulate the use of qualitative knowledge such as precedents solutions or
design guidelines and it is supposed to be very different from methods
commonly used by consultants.

With the definition of a 'designerly' simulation framework for each design
decision, we are assuming that different tools can be used in a similar
way (despite the differences between them), and that is why the scope of
tools will be limited to one or two tools in each category considered
(climate analysis, sun path, energy/thermal and CFD tools). It is not much
about the tools, but in finding ways to use these tools that are more
appropriate to fit in the designers way of thinking.

Best regards,
Raoni

Although it is just about to get an update as far as I am aware you  
should really read the CIBSE applications manual AM11 on environmental  
modelling. It will certainly give you some good input.

Dear Prof. Paul Strachan,

Thank you very much for your contribution. The thesis you suggested and
some of your works were already approached in my literature review (even
though I might occasionally need to re-read some of these works to get a
more in-depth view on the topic). As an architect, I feel that simulation
tools are evolving rapidly in terms of visual resources and engine
robustness, but we need to figure out how architects could use these tools
to solve design dilemmas (presumably, some of these tools were tailored
made for architects but are not being used by many). This 'designerly'
simulation process should have minimum impact on how designers proceed and
think in design practice and this is probably one of the focus of
my research.

Best regards,
Raoni

I guess a tiny little space (although it does not exist in the product) near
to the heated window panel should be built up as the heating source to heat
up the window. U values of the adjacent layers (I suppose they are all glaze
or air) should be adjusted to accommodate the radiant heating impacts. It
could be done in IES VE or TAS. I guess the surface temperature control
should also be considered in the simulation (It can be achieved in Apache
HVAC in IES VE).

Alternatively, radiant fraction of the room (considering the overall surface
temp. of enclosure and glass) should be adjusted to accommodate the impact
of heated glass. It would be simple but more empirical data is necessary to
support the calculation of the radiant fraction. Bear in mind, this method
does not cover the energy consumption required in glass. Post-procession is
required to compute the overall energy requirements.

Cheers,
Cheney

I am new to energy modeling and I am curious if there is a way to take credit for more efficient transformers in an energy model. Some of our transformer reps have said that there is not a LEED credit for more efficient transformers, but you have to gain the credit through the energy model. Would it just be through more heat in a space? I appreciate any information I can get in this matter.

You can model transformer sizes and losses in the detailed edit mode when you open up you electric meter.

I have to confess I have not modeled a transformer in a model yet (the default is not to model a transformer and the loss associated). You can specify a loss part load curve too:

TRANS-LOSS-FPLR
Takes the U-name of a curve that gives the multiplier on TRANSFORMER-LOSS as a function of the part load ratio (current hour load on the meter divided by TRANSFORMER-SIZE). The transformer loss is calculated hourly as
          (TRANSFORMER-SIZE) x (TRANSFORMER-LOSS) x (TRANS-LOSS-FPLR value)
The load is the sum of that due to all directly connected equipment and, for TYPE = UTILITY and BUILDING, other ELEC-METERs. The default curve is linear from 0.1 at zero load to 1.0 at full load.

Like I said I haven't done it yet - good luck. Let me know how it turns out

A transformer model will be added to the next version of EnergyPlus, which is expected to be released in October. That model can capture transformer energy losses and the interaction with the zone heat balance.

You can model transformer sizes and losses in the detailed edit mode when you open up you electric meter.

I have to confess I have not modeled a transformer in a model yet (the default is not to model a transformer and the loss associated). You can specify a loss part load curve too:

TRANS-LOSS-FPLR
Takes the U-name of a curve that gives the multiplier on TRANSFORMER-LOSS as a function of the part load ratio (current hour load on the meter divided by TRANSFORMER-SIZE). The transformer loss is calculated hourly as
          (TRANSFORMER-SIZE) x (TRANSFORMER-LOSS) x (TRANS-LOSS-FPLR value)
The load is the sum of that due to all directly connected equipment and, for TYPE = UTILITY and BUILDING, other ELEC-METERs. The default curve is linear from 0.1 at zero load to 1.0 at full load.

Like I said I haven't done it yet - good luck. Let me know how it turns out

Hello All,

It would be great if anyone can tell me if you have tried modeling a
Transpired Wall. If yes, could you please tell me the best software for
doing it (CFD/Energy modeling).
I know that RETScreen works well, but would like to know the results for a
dynamic situation (probably a year long simulation instead of spreadsheet
calcs).

Thank you very much.

If yes than it will shut off the mechanical system and calculate 0 energy for that hour.

 

Therefore in programs like IES and TAS you may be able to keep conditions below the set point even if the outdoor temperatures are hotter due to air movement etc. You may also want to come to an agreement with the client to allow a slightly higher set point, however you will need to also apply this to the baseline model. Otherwise for LEED, you can?t take account for the hours were naturally ventilation doesn?t provide comfort. Also note that the unmet load hours can be a maximum of 300 hours so potentially you could take credit for 300 hours for natural ventilation even if it is above the set point.

All,

 

we regularly design and model buildings which rely in part on natural ventilation as a source of free cooling. The issue we are often faced with is how to capture this benefit when performing a LEED Appendix G analysis. Appendix G states that all conditioned spaces must have BOTH heating and cooling. We would like to remove mechanical coolig in the proposed design building and thus gain benefit when comparing to the mechanical cooling system in the reference baseline building.

 

Has anyone tackled this issue and come to a satisfactory resolution? 

 

Thanks for your help.

No, just specifying the natural ventilation in the Nat Vent Tab will be
sufficient. If you also increase the infiltration than you are
effectively doubling the natural ventilation and you will allow OA into
the space when temperature conditions may not be suitable.

agreement with the client to allow a slightly higher set point, however
you will need to also apply this to the baseline model. Otherwise for
LEED, you can't take account for the hours were naturally ventilation
doesn't provide comfort. Also note that the unmet load hours can be a
maximum of 300 hours so potentially you could take credit for 300 hours
for natural ventilation even if it is above the set point.

And how did you model the natural ventilation?

In summer when external temperatures are above the room setpoint natural
ventilation during the day would not provide any cooling.

I am currently doing a naturally ventilated building for LEED and I
believe that if the space is achieving indoor temperatures between the
given set point using natural ventilation than the mechanical system
energy is 0 for the proposed design. Any hours where natural ventilation
can't achieve indoor temperatures within the set points, a mechanical
system needs to be modeled even if there isn't one in the proposed
building. This helps keep the unmet hours within the requirements for
LEED.

All,

 

we regularly design and model buildings which rely in part on natural
ventilation as a source of free cooling. The issue we are often faced
with is how to capture this benefit when performing a LEED Appendix G
analysis. Appendix G states that all conditioned spaces must have BOTH
heating and cooling. We would like to remove mechanical coolig in the
proposed design building and thus gain benefit when comparing to the
mechanical cooling system in the reference baseline building.

 

Has anyone tackled this issue and come to a satisfactory resolution? 

 

Thanks for your help.

David,

You can also refer the Journal of Building Performance Simulation (JBPS)
which is the official journal of the International Building Performance
Simulation Association (IBPSA).

The journal publishes original review papers and researched case studies of
international significance.

The wide scope of JBPS embraces research, technology and tool development
related to building performance modelling and simulation, as well as their
applications to design, operation and management of the built environment.

You can look up <http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/offer/tbps-so.asp>

Not sure what you are trying to accomplish, but here is a rundown of the simulation engines and code that I have experience that have either a plug in or open architectures.

Energyplus has a plug-in architecture that allows for code to be linked in. I think that the software license requires the plug-ins be considered part of the Energyplus application, and under DOE license. So DOE maintains ownership of all contributed code. I could be wrong on this point. You have to pay for a developer's license as well. The code is the best documented in the field. (F90)

ESP-r has a bunch of open source code that you could feasibly use as long as you release any modifications made under the GPL. ESP-r is great for digging around and finding algorithms with a debugger, and it seems you have computer skills. Highly efficient, but since it was grown on fortran, there are a lot of short variable names to deal with. (F77/F90/C)

TRNYSYS has 'Types' that you can write yourself and create your own libraries in Fortran or C to build whatever you want, could be a good test bed for algorithm development taking you from spreadsheets to code. Decent docs on creating your own 'types'(Fortran 77/90?)

DOE-2.1e has the ability to add your own functions. (F77)

There is the ASHRAE HVAC Toolkit that has libraries of stand-alone Fortran code. This is great for standalone calcs, but for full building simulation it may be easier to use the above as a base for development. (F77) 


Happy coding.

Any thoughts  on how to calculate wet bulb temp from TMY3 data set? ASHRAE's Fundamentals Handbook gives guidelines on calculating wet bulb but this requires trial and error. Does anybody has insight on alternative methods?

I think that the software license requires the plug-ins be considered part of the Energyplus application, and under DOE license. So DOE maintains ownership of all contributed code.

Chris,

Yanzhou is the nearest you can get in EPW format. Also attached a google map showing their geographical adjacency.

No, it's not a conditioned space. You might want to include any external
loads, eg gas infrared heaters, or ? as external loads to the building, but
IMHO outside is outside.

Xuchao is right. Yanzhou is the nearest city which is even closer to QUFU
compared as JINAN. chen

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Peak Loads Question and one Random Question
Message-ID: <AANLkTimKbo+aVrUf11aMf6jibmPjgMV1r=rYTDNiPVON@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have a question about some of the outputs from EQUEST that focus on space
and peak loads. First of all, the random question. When I modeled my recent
building, I created my 'spaces' so that each space would be it's own zone.
This made it very simple for creating zone groups (applying templates) in
the DD wizard, but I had a problem in that when I went into the detailed
edit and named the spaces, these changes did not occur to the 'zone' names
in the HVAC tab. Does anyone know a way to change these simultaneously or a
better workflow suggestion (this one my first use of equest for the detailed
edit)??

Now onto my 2nd question, I'm using Equest to calculate my HVAC loads
(system and space). For 3 of the 5 systems, I used a generic OA/person but
for two systems, I went ahead and put a set OA cfm(for a system) into one
zone and put the other zones at zero. Anyways, here is my question. When
looking at the outputs, I cannot figure why the difference between SV-A
(System Design Parameters) and LS-A (Space Peak Loads Summary DESIGN
DAY).For instance, in the system that I turned the OA air off in most of hte
zones, I'm still getting differences in the results and do not understand
this. Any help in explaining these differences would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!

I'm sure others have better answers.

But.....

The names you create in the Wizard disappear in the Detailed Edit. Better to 
write them down, then translate them into the proper spaces/zones. I understand 
this problem may go away in eQuest 3.64, when it becomes available.

The other question has to to with LOADS and SYSTEMS peak sizes. LOADS is 
strictly the "barn" without any outside air or coil attached to it. The SYSTEMS 
outputs have a fan, coil, and ventilation attached. Even with No OSA, you have 
fan heat, coil loosses, and duct losses that will change your results.

Benjamin,

We've written a variety of scripts to help out with tasks such as changing the zone name to reflect manual change of the space name.  It doesn't prevent all the pain, but at least 50%.  It seems like a line or two of code could solve this within eQuest...perhaps it will in v3.64. as John mentioned.

Arunabha --

 

In WINDOW 5, the Window Library has a DOE2 "report" that can be saved as a
file to be used with the DOE2 program, which in this case is eQuest. I don't
know if you already did this, and that is how you are getting the error
messages you describe below. In that file is information about the whole
window, including the glazing system, and this is the only way to import
glazing system information into DOE2.

 

What kind of "custom" glazing data are you generating from Window 5 to be
imported into eQuest ? Can you email me the DOE2 report you are generating
from WINDOW 5, if that is what you are doing ?

Hi,

 

 

Is there any way to import costumed Glazing data to eQuest from Window 5?

I tried to do it and eQuest was giving me the error - "Invalid U-value
Conditions - likely due to non-NFRC conditions being specified in the Window
program."

But when I change the "Environmental conditions" in Window 5 while creating
glazing, eQuest is showing error - "Missing or invalid Glazing Description

Bill,

A few of us (AEI, ASHRAE, Labs21, and NREL)  began a dialogue about this in January hoping to get published clarity via the 90.1 Continuous Maintenance process.  The timing of our comments happened to coincide with committee voting already in progress and no clarification was made.  However, it was discussed that the intent is that the 5000 CFM minimum is in reference to System exhaust rates, not the exhaust rates of a single Space.

Hope that helps.

Kevin,

I would suggest that the large loop hole created between G3.1.2.10 (itself and exception h) and your interpretation of G3.1.1 (exception d) does not seem synchronous with the trajectory of 90.1 and ASHRAE's overall goal of reducing energy use in buildings.  As I mentioned in my previous post, a few of us (AEI, ASHRAE, Labs21, and NREL)  began a dialogue about this in January hoping to get published clarity via the 90.1 Continuous Maintenance process.  The timing of our comments happened to coincide with committee voting already in progress and no clarification was made.  However, it was discussed that the intent is that the 5000 CFM minimum is in reference to System exhaust rates, not the exhaust rates of a single Space.

If we're not careful and professionally discerning about loopholes like this one (many of which have thankfully been closed due to the efforts of various groups and volunteers through the CM process and committee participation) we are perpetuating the very type of modeling that has led to modeled vs. actual energy discrepancies that have brought so much critique in recent years.

Perhaps your perspective is shared by others and an open discussion on the topic would serve the modeling community well.  Thanks for chiming in.

Paul

Cross posting not necessary.

What unique method is being used to capture this heat?  What type of 
appliances, equipment?

The heat from plug loads is "captured" via heat absorbed by the 
return air stream, this is mixed at the air handler and moved around 
the building.  For fan coils, heat pumps, etc,  heat is one zone is 
moved to other zones via the fluid transfer.  This mechanism helps 
offset the boiler load.

Is there something else you had in mind?

Is the "CHP Calculation Methodology for LEED-NC v2.2 EA Credit 1" Document
still valid? 

We have problem to proof the required annual efficiency of 60% because plants
are power plants who only share little waste-heat to district heating
network.

Good morning external DES stakeholders:
 
As an FYI, the updated & improved version 2.0 DES guidance document is now
official and posted. It covers D&C programs for both LEED v2.x and LEED 2009;
see the front matter in the document for details on how to apply it to each.
The EBOM version is not ready yet but will be later this summer.

Yes - the document Mike provided a link to is updated and the title was
updated to include LEED 2009.  Here is a direct link to the PDF with the
new requirements:

 

http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=7671

 

The link may change in the future if the document is updated or
relocated.

 

Your question is making me think, though - I'll try to come up with some
additional thoughts after I have had some time to think about how I
would go about handling this situation.

Good morning external DES stakeholders:
 
As an FYI, the updated & improved version 2.0 DES guidance document is
now official and posted. It covers D&C programs for both LEED v2.x and
LEED 2009; see the front matter in the document for details on how to
apply it to each. The EBOM version is not ready yet but will be later
this summer.

Hello,



My baseline is a PSZ-HP and just want to confirm if I am right in using Table 6.8.1B for my minimum efficiency requirements. Ive read somewhere that?Table 6.8.1A should be used for System 4-PSZ-HP but I doubt if this is correct. Can someone confirm this? Thank you.

The just released DES v2 document includes its own CHP guidance in Appendix D.

LEED v2.x projects appear to have the choice of following either
A) The new DES v2 document 
or
B) The old DES v1 document and the separate old CHP document

LEED 2009 projects do not appear to get the choice because the website states "Projects using LEED 2009 should use version 2.0 of the guidance, but cannot use version 1.0."

This is appears to be another case of adding requirements to already registered projects.  Should we complain or thank the USGBC for the opportunity to get more fees?

CALL FOR PAPERS FOR A SPECIAL ISSUE OF THE

Journal of Building Performance Simulation



OLYMPIC VENUES AND INFRASTRUCTURE



Guest editors: Pieter de Wilde, Dejan Mumovic and Malcolm Cook



The publisher of the Journal of Building Performance Simulation, Taylor & Francis, together with Routledge, intend to produce a collection of special issues of journals that deal with the Olympic and Paralympic Games of London 2012. Olympic and Paralympic Games generate substantial construction projects in the host country, involving the development of flagship stadia, athlete and press accommodation, and many other spin-off projects. These projects will have worldwide attention during the games. It is therefore crucial for the host nation to ensure they are high performance, state-of-the-art facilities.



This Special Issue of the Journal of Building Performance Simulation invites contributions which address the building performance of Olympic Venues - especially those for London 2012 - across the different building simulation domains: thermal behaviour (energy and comfort), ventilation and air flow, lighting, fire and evacuation, acoustics, and integrated views that combine these domains. Papers are welcome that address different levels of spatial resolution, covering Olympic buildings and their components, Olympic sites, but also the urban level beyond these sites. Contributions may cover different levels of innovation, starting from regular engineering application (fitness for purpose checks) to more innovative studies that deal with topics such as urban development and planning, climate change, sustainability and reuse of facilities after the end of the games.

Submissions: authors are asked to submit a 300-500 word abstract describing the focus, research, results and conclusions of the paper they propose to submit. Abstracts and further enquiries should be emailed to Dr Pieter de Wilde, pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk by 12 November 2010. Full papers are due 20 May 2011 via Manuscript Central at http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tbps.

Just going through table 6.4 in ASHRAE 62.1-2007 it looks like the minimum exhaust rates for labs (educational science laboratories) is 1 cfm/ft2. That amounts to an ACH of 6 (for a 10ft ceiling) and 6.7 for a 9ft ceiling.

Am I interpreting that correctly? Does that mean for LEED projects we cannot go below 6 - 7 ACH? Is there a way around it?

Does anyone know what is meant by the paragraph at the bottom of Page 4:

" LEED v2009 projects are not formally required to use this guidance at this time, but using it is highly recommended to help ensure a smooth LEED certification review. USGBC is working to incorporate this guidance into LEED v2009 more formally, but that process is not yet complete."

Does this mean we don't need to perform the whole upstream equipment modeling part?

The just released DES v2 document includes its own CHP guidance in Appendix D.

LEED v2.x projects appear to have the choice of following either
A) The new DES v2 document 
or
B) The old DES v1 document and the separate old CHP document

LEED 2009 projects do not appear to get the choice because the website states "Projects using LEED 2009 should use version 2.0 of the guidance, but cannot use version 1.0."

This is appears to be another case of adding requirements to already registered projects.  Should we complain or thank the USGBC for the opportunity to get more fees?

I think y'all have misunderstood the new DES guidance. It's designed to
simplify things. 

Under the old guidance you had to run the model twice - once as a stand
alone building, then again including the district energy plant.

Now you have a choice - you can run it either way.

If you are a v2009 project, the new guidance is optional. If you want to do
it the hard way, no one will stop you.

Chris/Others,

I'm wondering if you've understood the new document as I have for CHP.  If you have CHP and are pursuing Performance Path Option 2, you actually still have to model the Proposed building twice, once with utilities that you're purchasing from the CHP plant to determine the HW and/or CHW fractions related to "CHP Electric Output" and the other as having virtual chillers/boilers.  What had seemed more straightforward on the surface isn't quite so once you dig in.

In general I'm curious how others have perceived the document.  The flexibility to consider annualized performance is great, especially for straightforward boiler/chiller DES, but it seems like many clients (mainly universities) will still not be able to provide the required level of data resolution needed to document CHP performance.  Perhaps this will be a new impetus for performance monitoring. 

Regards,
Paul

Hi there,

 

I'm going to assume you're using eQuest and are trying to specify window
properties within.

 

If you are using eQuest and trying to specify your window using the
'Simplified' method by inputting your winter or summer U-value for glass
conductance... sorry, you're doing it wrong =).  You really should read
the help file titled GLASS-CONDUCTANCE, and reference the table therein.
Neither summer nor winter U-values go in that field.  It would probably
be a good idea to review the help files specific to the other inputs
there as well.

 

The following discussion may help illuminate the topic as well (I'd
suggest the help file first):  
http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2005-Oct
ober/013126.html

 

There are 3 ways to specify windows:  'simplified,' selecting a
best-match entry in the DOE2 library, and importing data from LBNL's
WINDOW4/5

 

Creating your glazing assemblies in WINDOW5 seems the hip thing to do if
you really want to lock your glazing performance down.  There's been
discussion here on the lists that the simplified method does not
correctly model glazing performance when the sun is at an angle other
than perpendicular to the plane (where the other two methods account for
this) - the results can purportedly be significantly different,
depending on your climate/building geometries.  I personally find
utilizing the DOE2 glass library to be the easiest method, when that's
appropriate.

Hello,

 

I have two U values for my glass, a winter U-value and summer U-value.
Does it mean that if my building is located in climate zone 1 where no
winter exist I should be using the summer U-value? And if my building is
in a zone where there is winter I should be using winter U-values?

 

Thank you in advance for replies.

It is technically possible. I have never done it on an active project. I
suspect it would be beneficial on a large scale project with someone who
knows what they're doing in all three programs. I wrote a paper on the
transfer process from Revit - gbXML - Trane Trace (RGT). It is attached.
I'm sure there are many similarities with the Revit - Ecotect - E+ process
as with the RGT process.

I also included my presentation at SimBuild.

Yes.
You have to include it in the model (for thermal loading) and subtract it in the final calculations as an unregulated load

As part of our non-profit work, Rocky Mountain Institute is compiling energy
audit checklists that specifically take building energy simulation into
account. The purpose is to include building simulation inputs in a level III
energy audit data gathering process. If anyone can share checklists they
have already made, we will be making them freely available and you would be
contributing to something that will eventually benefit yourselves and
others.

The catagories we need checklists for are as follows:

*General Building Info*

   - building envelope
   - operation schedules
   - Lighting
   - Plug Loads
   - utility data
   - domestic hot water system info
   - Zoning setpoints and schedules (temp and RH)

*HVAC and Controls Options*

   - Hot Water Boilers
   - Steam Boilers
   - Pumps (generalized for any type)
   - Chillers
   - Packaged AC (gas-packs, HP?s, DX, etc)
   - Built up AHUs (CHW & HHW coils)
   - Cooling Towers
   - Baseboards
   - Ductwork systems
   - Piping Systems
   - VAV and Fan Powered Terminals
   - Fan Coil Units

*Specialty Loads*

   - swimming pools
   - restaurant/kitchen equipment
   - labs equipment/fume hoods
   - refrigeration equipment
   - motors
   - air compressors

Message-ID: <AANLkTim_Xz9QqU7dftyuthh-Zjp9ViypYc-1nLnKZ+HA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Bldg-Sim subscribers,
I have modeled a 4 story building in Trace for a LEED project. Our process
energy in total amounts to only 11% of the Proposed Energy Cost for the
year. When entering this information at leedonline in Minimum Energy
Performance compliance form, the form says "NO" in the end that we have not
complied with minimum energy performance pre-requisites which i think is
because of the Process energy being less than 25%. The credit mentions that
you could add a document why the process energy for any given project is
under 25%.
I would like to ask you all if any of you have successfully entered that
information and if yes, where? Also, does adding the document makes the
compliance form say "YES" in the end?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

All,
 
My former employer decided to drop energy modeling as a business offering. I
am now available for freelance work in both commercial and residential
energy modeling using eQUEST. To date I have completed over a dozen projects
for design case analyses, federal tax credit and/or USGBC LEED
certification. I also have a very strong background in IT, am knowledgable
in building science and have Manual J and D experience.

I also teach beginning and intermediate level eQUEST classes and am
available to travel to your location given a sufficent number of students.

Amit,

Here is an email that clarifies what "not to do" in regards to 25% Process modeling  and you are on the right track-model the process as it is-without adding virtual loads to beat 25%.
It comes from Marcus Sheffer, Chair USGBC EA TAG.

*How to make it say "Yes" on the Template, not sure....maybe someone else can add to this, I haven't done it yet.

Regards,
Nikola

As for limitations, there are some limitations when it comes to the
Mechanical System design.  Though eQuest has a number of different
mechanical systes, it does not take all designs, one example being using
boiler connected to geothermal supply line for reheat.  I tried it before
and did not work. If anyone worked something out, please let me know.
Thanks

I would recommend documenting what your modeled process loads (w/ft2, kW etc) are and adding the schedules applied to it as part of the documentation.

They are just looking to make sure that you have modeled it realistically. 11% does seem low, but it depends on the building function.

I've experimented with this a bit, and it is possible.  However, the only useful information you really get out of Revit is the building form and even that requires substantial tweaking on one side or the other to make an appropriate energy model.  To my thinking, it is much more efficient to just import the geometry into SketchUp and use that as a background to trace while building a simplified thermal model in OpenStudio.  A similar process would work with any interface you choose.

Here is a link to a blog post that describes the process you're asking about.

I wrote a paper on the transfer process from Revit - gbXML - Trane Trace (RGT). It is attached. I'm sure there are many similarities with the Revit - Ecotect - E+ process as with the RGT process.

Vikram,

Good question...a bit interesting to try and answer.

First, your calculations are correct.

Second, it is interesting that only "educational science laboratories" are mentioned, somehow suggesting that their use is different from corporate and institutional labs.

Third, EH&S often makes this determination and there is no agreement among standards/guidelines dealing with lab ventilation so to impose this bit of Std 62 seems like something that the USGBC should be considering as it moves towards connecting Appendix G to Std 62 rates.

Fourth, related to that last point, while Appendix G does not yet directly require Std 62 rates for the baseline, LEED requires Std 62 rates for the proposed and 90.1 requires the baseline ventilation to match the proposed.  So, it would seem that models should be reflecting the 1 cfm/sf requirement.

There is a grey area that I think may also be a point of discussion.  Minimum exhaust rates of various types are often only required when the space is occupied.  As such, and considering that many university EH&S folks are at least beginning to bat around the notion of, if not adopt, a 4 ACH minimum during unoccupied periods, it seems fair to have a value lower than 1 cfm/sf during unoccupied periods.  What's your perspective on this?

It'd be good if others chime in and help develop a consensus.

Just going through table 6.4 in ASHRAE 62.1-2007 it looks like the minimum exhaust rates for labs (educational science laboratories) is 1 cfm/ft2. That amounts to an ACH of 6 (for a 10ft ceiling) and 6.7 for a 9ft ceiling.

Am I interpreting that correctly? Does that mean for LEED projects we cannot go below 6 - 7 ACH? Is there a way around it?

  When we provide energy design assistance for labs, a significant 
energy efficiency strategy is to try to get the client to really 
consider ventilation requirements and get them down as low as possible.  
This can be taken further with good focused ventilation strategies.
After going through this optimization process, though, I really think 
the final modeling has to have the same ventilation airflow rates in the 
baseline and proposed models (for occupied and unoccupied periods).  
Different types of labs will have different ventilation/ exhaust 
requirements; I don't see how 1 cfm/SF could be be applied to all 
laboratory spaces.
Having more resources to help design teams and clients reduce design 
ventilation rates as much as possible would be really useful....maybe 
there's a way to use 62.1 & Appendix G modeling to encourage this, but 
it would need to be a lot more detailed than 1 cfm/ SF.

I have taken credit for unoccupied ACH levels in the past, since Appendix G
specific a 50% turndown from peak ACH during unoccupied hours (G3.1.1,
Exception c.). My understanding is that you can take for an unoccupied
turndown above and beyond a 50% reduction from peak.

Also, all of this only applies to systems that are 5,000 cfm or more -
otherwise the baseline building exhaust fan system and operation should be
the same as the proposed design.

This is an important discussion, at least it is 
timely for my needs both as a reviewer and 
submitter.  I am very interested in hearing from 
other LEED (and other energy program, HPNC, 
Manitoby Hydro, etc.), energy simulation reviewers.

And with all due respect, Gord, I do welcome your 
consideration and thoughts on this issue, it 
needs to be made clear by the CaGBC and USGBC as 
to what the intentions are as to the budget case 
outdoor air requirements and exactly who "the 
authority having juristiction" is?

The first question is about "the authority having 
jurisdiction" - as far as labs, health care 
facilities, etc.  The second question is about 
air system design and what constitutes proper 
design as far as the outdoor air calculation and 
the intended long term purposes of the facility.

So first, "the authority having jurisdiction":

This is an excellent question about ASHRAE 90.1; 
without and with Appedix G cases; LEED - USGBC 
and that Review Organization and "the authority 
having juristiction".  For example, from the 
Green Care For Health Guide, Version 2.2, 
Appendix G, Design Assumptions & Procedures for 
Modeling for the GGHC Energy Credits:

"Ventilation, air changes and air pressure 
relationships: Use specific ventilation rates, 
air changes, and pressure relationships, as 
required by authorities having jurisdiction. If 
the authorities having jurisdiction have no 
specific requirements, use the requirements from 
2006 AIA Guidelines for Design and Construction 
of Hospital and Health Care Facilities, or most recent version. "

Then forther on, in the same document, it states:
"Process Ventilation loads:  Special ventilation 
requirements in a health care facility are not 
unusual.  While Table OCC-1 quantifies the 
typical ventilation in a health care facility, 
some spaces may require higher ventilation 
rates.  The higher ventilation rates shall be 
simulated in both the Baseline and Proposed 
building simulation runs, making this an energy neutral feature. "

 From the health care prospective, ventilation is 
very specific and the "authority having 
jurisdiction" is basically the facility and their 
designers.  Therefore the calculation of outdoor 
air requirements would have to be accompanied by 
letters from that authority - whom ever it might 
be.  In my experience these letters typically are 
submitted with a fairly detailed air system 
balance calculation noting the standards the designer is following.

I agree with this intent and I believe that the 
requirements for heat recovery cover cases like 
this where, in reality, HVAC systems often have 
in excess of 70% outdoor air and greater than 
5000 cfm and therefore the budget case system has 
heat recovery as a requirement (at least in 
reading 90.1-2004).  For smaller systems, the 
budget case will perform significantly poorer 
than the proposed design that has heat recovery.

I believe that the outdoor air requirements 
should be based on the minimums suggested in 
ASHRAE 62 and other standards such as CSA-Z317, 
but each facility had to determine their outdoor 
air requirements and should not be penalized by 
artificially restricting the budget case how the 
reviewer interprets the requirements of 90.1, 
LEED, 62.1, CSA Z317, the ASHRAE Application 
Table, Table 7.6.3 Ventilation Requirements for 
Areas Affecting Patient Care In Hosptitals and Outpatient Facilities, etc.

For example, in the case of a University facility 
with a new medical medical education facility 
complete with medical labs, exam areas, etc.  The 
"Owner" deemed certain spaces, systems as medical 
facilities and mandated typical health care, 
higher, ventilation rates.  While not all the 
building falls into this category, a reviewer 
must accept the  design outdoor  air requirements 
as meeting the requirements of "the authority 
having jurisdiction" and allow the budget case to 
have the same outdoor air amounts.

I believe that labs any medical labs fall into 
this category.  A level 3  lab had very strict 
ventilation requirements and the budget case will 
necessarily have the same outdoor air 
requirements and will have any heat recovery, 
ventilation control as required by ASHRAE 90.1, 
and the other standards to which the facility is designed.

SECOND - what constitutes "correct design" in 
terms of the level of outdoor air delivered.

Example, two examples, one a large long term, 
expandable, flexible HVAC system on a university 
campus - as the building will have, at one time 
or another in the detailed life cycle analysis 
for the facility, labs, dense occupant lecture 
theatres, offices, perhaps dormitories.  At any 
rate, the designers have decided, in their wisdom 
and I mean that with due respect, that the system 
should simply be a 100% OA system with variable 
flow control for all current and intended space 
functions.  So, yes there will be offices with 
100% OA.  As this is a single fan system, any 
critical outdoor air calculation will result in a 
100% OA system.  It will have variable flow 
control, demand ventilation control in zones with 
variable occupancy - either CO2 or occupancy 
sensor.  It will have heat recovery.

In this case, the budget case will indeed be a 
100% OA system, with heat recovery as per 
90.1-2004 6.5.6 and exhaust air control as per 
6.5.7 (as appropriate).  I don't believe that the 
USGBC, its review arm, the CaGBC, etc. can 
mandate that the outdoor air has to be lower 
because the system has use a critical zone 
calculation that results in more than 20% above 
the sum of the space by space, uncorrected 
ventilation rates - or some other arbitrary percentage.

In the other case, the facility is a smaller, 
fixed use but mixed use facility with a small 
portion requiring a 100% OA system and the other 
small portion being office, storage, corridors, 
etc.  The pressure and filtration requirements, 
and other design requirements (regardless of what 
standards), initial cost, controllability and the 
other myriad of design goals, results in a 100% 
OA system.  It is less than 5000 cfm, and but 
more than 70% OA.  In this case I believe that 
the budget case will should have the same 100% OA 
system and the not have heat recovery, exhaust control as per 90.1-2004.

I am very interested in hearing from other LEED 
(and other energy programs, 90.1, GGHC, HPNC, 
Manitoby Hydro, etc.) energy simulation reviewers.

Note that I am quoting 90.1-2004, that is the 
latest I can access, the 2007 electronic version 
has the wonderful feature of rendering itself 
useless when you upgrade your computer, 
apparently I have to contact ASHRAE somehow to 
provide an unlocking key, now where did I jot down that password?

First, bravo on the new 3.64!  It's no guess that your new LEED compliance
feature is going to be very heavily used.  But, on behalf of the sanity of
all your programs users, please issue one more document - a complete list of
error and warning messages with the recommended resolution.  As you can see

Dear all,

I'm currently working for a R&D center on District Heating and Cooling
system supplying 90c hot water, which is mandatory in the area. No way to
change to other chiller or system.

It easily meets EAp2 requirements on heating compared to baseline but fails
to meet for cooling compared baseline (electrical centrifugal chiller)
We have set up the baseline based on ASHRAE Appendix G assuming electrical
one for cooling on the baseline.
I wonder if there are any exceptional ways to solve this problem. (i.e.
baseline with other district cooling system).
COP of absortion chiller of design building is of course much lower than
baseline(electric) but cost of hot water is not low enough to compensate
this COP gap.

thank you in advance for sharing your ideas on this.

      any similar cases
      any way to be exempted from USGBC

best regards,

Under LEED, the HVAC system type for semiheated space

It is technically possible. I have never done it on an active project. I
suspect it would be beneficial on a large scale project with someone who
knows what they're doing in all three programs. I wrote a paper on the
transfer process from Revit - gbXML - Trane Trace (RGT). It is attached.
I'm sure there are many similarities with the Revit - Ecotect - E+
process as with the RGT process. 

I also included my presentation at SimBuild.

Alan,

Thanks for the site! I'll check out the videos tonight. Have you had any
luck correctly importing custom architectural envelope families correctly?

Hello,

I have a project that uses solar thermal tubes to heat up water, which is
used for radiant floor heating.  During the peak hours, solar thermal is
boosted by a boiler.  Can anyone please expalin how I can model that?  If it
can be modelled, how do I control the loop in a way that the boilers kick in
only when solar thermal cannot keep up?  Thanks everyone.

System type FPH meets your needs.

SYSTEM Type = FPH

<coveredindetailbyseparatetopics21.htm>
<inputtemplateforastandardfphunit.htm>
 SYSTEM Type = FPH

Floor Panel Heating System

The Floor Panel Heating System provides heating for one or more zones by
circulation of heated fluid through a network of pipes embedded in the floor
or ceiling. A single pump, rather than the primary-secondary pumping
arrangement shown in the schematic, is installed for single-zone systems.
Space temperature in each zone is controlled by varying the temperature of
the fluid circulating in that zone. Hourly head addition rate is determined
for this system exactly as for other types of systems. Pumping energy
associated with this system is accounted for by the PUMP attached to the
CIRCULATION-LOOP. The ratio of panel heat losses to panel heating output
must be estimated by you and entered; see the keyword PANEL-HEAT-LOSS in the
ZONE command). The program assumes that this ratio of heat loss to
heatoutput remains constant over the full range of panel output.

Figure 59  Floor panel heating system

Other names and/or applications for FPH

None. Note that the simulation does not account for the radiant comfort
aspects of panel heating; therefore, a lower heating setpoint is
appropriate.

The only issue with FPH is that outdoor air and exhaust fans may not 
be simulated.

I think that depends on the total volume of exhaust. I don't have it in front of me, but I think if your exhaust is more than a certain amount you have to have either energy recovery to fifty percent or vav flow.

Correct me if I'm wrong here, but I read the question as less about radiant
floor heating, and more about solar thermal water heating with a backup
boiler.

If my memory serves from this very listserv, eQuest does not model thermal
storage (hot water, or otherwise) very well; it considers only the 1st law
of thermodynamics, that is- BTU's in-- BTU's out.  It does not monitor
temperature of the thermal storage.  So, if you put 1 MBTU into a water tank
(no matter the size or starting temperature), you'll get 1 MBTU of useful
heating out.  This also means that it cannot model the need for a backup
when temperatures in the thermal storage are not sufficient for the load.
At least, that's the information that I gathered when I tried to answer your
exact question Maudud.

For a more careful analysis, I've heard others mention the use of SunREL,
EnergyPlus, and TRANSYS.   For the time being, I have been creating some
rather unwieldy spreadsheets to answer these sorts of questions for myself.

Other questions -

If you model it as constant volume, do you use full sash height or resticted sash height?

When you model a VAV system, what assumptions do you make about the user's behaviour in closing the hoods, or are you keeping them closed whenever no one is standing in front of them by employing an Automatic Sash Positioning System?

I think it also depends on the software you are using to model a fume hood.
Because if exhaust is specified more than the supply  due to the hood, the
software  may disregard the lower supply and equate the higher value of
exhaust to the supply. I am also trying to  model a VAV exhaust fume hood
and facing a lot of problems doing it. So you have to figure out a way to
control you exhaust by altering your VAV supply.
If you know some other way, please let me know also :)

  I just spent a while digging through all the latest docs on modeling 
labs for a LEED analysis (90.1-2004, 90.1-2007, addenda, & Labs 21).  
This is my interpretation:

    * If the /building/ has fume hood exhaust over 15,000 cfm, the
      Baseline system is VAV, and exhaust is turned down to at least 50%
      for unoccupied hours.  I am modeling the unoccupied turn down rate
      the same in the Baseline as in the Proposed models, because how
      low it can go at night depends on the type of lab (ie: the project
      doesn't get more credit for turning down to 20%).  This is from
      Labs 21, and 90.1 (2004 or 2007) section 6.5.7.2.
    * A project can claim energy savings for demand controlled fume
      hoods during occupied hours if the controls are automatic (Labs21
      has some schedules for guidance in modeling this).
    * Energy recovery is not modeled in the Baseline (see 90.1-2007
      G3.1.2.10 Exception h).

Let me know if you have a different interpretation....I don't think all 
these issues are laid out in detail for modelers yet.

Thanks for all the help. Here is another angle I am coming from.

Assuming the base case were to be a traditional fume hood exhaust system
which used constant volume fans in order to create the 3000 fpm
discharge velocity. If the fume hoods have sash control the there is an
outside air by-pass on the fan header, so down stream VAV and upstream
constant volume exhaust fans.  I know these constant volume fans can be
staged to form a 'quasi' variable exhaust. So if this were the base case
then one could apply the list of various innovations on how to apply
variable exhaust flow to the proposed model.

The ASHRAE 90.1 6.5.7.2 isnt really a solution, however Aleka you
mention Lab 21, have you had any luck in getting this accepted by the
LEED meanies?

Can anyone tell me when modeling a lab system with fume hoods as to
whether the baseline systems are to be modeled as constant volume?

(subsequent alternatives will have variable volume fume hoods).

Just had this comment from a reviewer - the ASHRAE 90.1 handbook
explains this (it was page G-21 in the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Handbook, but I
don't have the 2007 handbook to tell you that page number).  For a
semi-heated space, the baseline building models only the heating portion
of the system.  For an unconditioned space, the baseline has no system
modeled (any energy use is a penalty in the proposed model).
Conditioned spaces must be modeled based on the systems designed and the
baseline system per Table G3.1.1B; however, where a heating or cooling
system is not designed the proposed model must use the same system as
the baseline respectively (heating or cooling).

 

The semi-heated space heating system would need to comply with the
baseline system provisions for heating systems in Appendix G for the
baseline model and the proposed system would be modeled as it is
designed.

Assumption validation if you please ;^)

 

Under LEED, the HVAC system type for semiheated space 

should be the same in both the baseline and the proposed 

buildings, correct?

Hello:

I can't speak to the LEED NC exam, but I can say that anyone who takes and passes the ASHRAE BEM Certificate really has to know something about building energy modeling, and probably much more. The ASHRAE Building Energy Modeling (BEM) exam was developed by ASHRAE in cooperation with IBPSA USA. IBPSA USA and ASHRAE have also developed a BEM workshop to assist in reviewing for the BEM exam, which I'd highly recommend as well. Dates for these workshops can be found on the ASHRAE web page, as well as the IBPSA USA web page, and other places.

As someone who has taken and passed the exam, I can say that it was one of the hardest exams I've taken in a long time. It really tested my knowledge of building energy simulation and, with so many questions, and so short a time, it really tested my ability to sit through such an rigorous ordeal, and answer questions one after another, in rapid fire. I was humbled by the experience, and I've taught simulation since the early 1980s.

Finally, it is my biased opinion that the building energy performance industry will soon begin to see the value in having "ASHRAE BEM Certified" simulators. Hence, I would strongly recommend giving this some serious consideration as a career enhancing opportunity.

Jeff

PS: I'd also consider taking the ASHRAE BEM workshop...a good warm up for the exam.
