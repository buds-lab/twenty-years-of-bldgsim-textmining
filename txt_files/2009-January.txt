FYI...
 
You can do this with DOE-2 or EQUEST by cutting off the simulation at the SYSTEMS portion and summing
the chilled water and hot water that goes to PLANT. I believe you'll find the information you need in the
SS-D report for the total loads going to PLANT.

I'm trying to figure out a way to model utility rates using a campus chiller.  The building is billed by the ton of chilled water used.  If anyone can help me find a way to do this it would be greatly appreciated.

Happy new year;
Could any one point to research on the actual effectiveness of using radiant
barrier as house wall wrap? Most of the research that I found talks about
radiant barrier in attic or roof. 
Thank you

Hi All,

I am interested in running a study on the efficiency of various external shading devices and glass types used.

In order to achieve that, I have modeled a high-rise HDB building (public housing) using Spore weather but have encountered difficulties in inputting accurate details regarding the HVAC of the building.

Is anyone conducting a similar study or familiar with the topic above so that I can approach you for assistance?

Will greatly appreciate it and thank you all.

Message-ID: <E81162D94AB7874ABE509EA0CF4D5198CB04A3@exchange.mdaengr.com>

I am trying to model a large building with heating and no cooling.  The
heating is constant volume.  90.1 Appendix G says I need to model the
baseline system as a VAV system with heating and cooling, and that I
need to include the baseline cooling system in the proposed building.

 

Trace 700 does not allow "divorcing" the heating from the cooling, which
means I will  end up with a VAV heating system.  

 

Trane CDS is saying that this is what I have to do.  I accept the need
to have a VAV cooling system, but being forced to have the heating as
VAV means the energy differences between the proposed heating and the
90.1 minimum heating system will not be calculated since they are the
same.

 

My question is, how do I model the heating system as constant volume and
have the VAV cooling system?  Has anyone had this problem and did you
just live with it?

The baseline cooling system is electric dx, not necessarily VAV.  I would
assume you could just model a constant volume electric DX unit in your
proposed case.

 

Also, you can change your cooling schedule to something unreasonably high
like 95 degrees, then the cooling should never come on.  As far as I know,
this is a legitimate as ASHRAE and LEED do not mandate what temperatures
should be used.

The building is 1.5 million square feet, so 90.1 requires chilled water
for the cooling system.  

 

"Also, you can change your cooling schedule to something unreasonably
high like 95 degrees, then the cooling should never come on.  As far as
I know, this is a legitimate as ASHRAE and LEED do not mandate what

I had tried setting the cooling coils to zero capacity and also setting
the T-stat so that no cooling was required.  But then it comes up with
no heating system airflow because it uses the cooling system as a basis
for heating system airflow calculations.

 

Good thought though...

Dear Nick,
 
I think past discussion on this list agreed that you can model a cooling
system which has very high setpoints.  I recall (though you'll have to check
past threads) that there may even have been a CIR which acknowledged this as
legitimate.
 
Regardless, the practice fulfills the "spirit" of the ASHRAE standard and
LEED.  You want to create a faithful model that predicts something
realistic.  A 95F stat does the trick (in my opinion)

Teck Chew

There are a number of projects involving HDB buildings in the past.
Profs Lee Siew Eang and Wong Nyuk Hien of NUS are the names to google
up. You will find many publications on that subject.

Why do you want to include HVAC for HDB buildings? They are supposed
to be naturally ventilated arent they? Most of the AC units found in
those buildings are just split units or even the window units, nothing
fancy there. You easily do this in whatever simulation program you use
(EPlus or EQuest or ESP-r or whatever).

I am not conducting any study on that subject at the moment, but you
can contact me if you need further help.

Just out of interest really...

Does anybody have any experience of modelling dynamic demand systems. 
For example, a heat pump might "listen" to the frequency of the 
electricity grid (lower frequency represents large concurrent demand) 
and adjust it's demand down accordingly.

It just seems like an interesting modelling exercise and I was wondering 
if anybody has had any success and with which software.

All,

I want to match the number from detailed report (in this case LS-F)
with hourly report.

The variable that I want to match is the solar radiation through
external windows. I have reported the total (direct+diffuse)
transmitted solar radiation (this is variable no 13 under window
hourly reports). If I multiply these values with the area of the
windows and multiply by the SC, I should have the total transmitted
solar radiation for the whole year. However, the number does not match
with the total in LS-F.

Did I pick a wrong variable?

Thanks,

Ery

Message-ID: <16ED1A0FED13C843B937B471104A793201DEE98294@TT-CMS1.ttemi.com>

Hi All,

This may seem like a continuation of a thread from last week. I am currently working on a model utilizing 10 AHU's for a 150,000 S.F. building. I am having problems with the unmet hours (both cooling and heating). Each shell of the model has been divided up into many spaces according to use type. This results in hundreds of zones with their own report from the Detailed Simulation Output File in the SS-F Zone Demand Summary section. It appears some perimeters zones, in all orientations, have very low unmet hours (<5), but some core zones have many unmet hours (>50+). Does anyone have any suggestions on how to reduce unmet hours in these core zones. Also, does everyone compound all of the unmet hours from all of the zones while filling out LEED NC 2.2, EA Credit 1, Section 1.3-Advisory Messages?

Thank You,

Following up on the topic of taking credit for the Elevator Efficiency for
the proposed case as compared to the LEED baseline, has anyone been able to
successfully document it and eventually gained approval from the LEED
reviewers. If so could you please share the methodology.

Chris,
Two things come to mind. We've done something similar in simulating 
grid-tied power systems that include some renewable sources (wind and 
pv), a battery bank, an electrolyzer, a fuel cell, and a grid that is 
sometimes unavailable. The controls sense (among other things) the 
availability of the grid and act accordingly. I am also aware of some 
work being done at Penn State on a pv/battery system that knows what the 
utility rates are at the current time. Again the controls make a 
decision about whether to meet the load with the PV or with the grid 
based on something that is going on in the grid at the current time. 
Both projects were done using TRNSYS.
Kind regards,
David

Message-ID: <F2581FB6-0141-4183-BFBB-9FF7B575066F@pgengineers.com>

Good Morning,

We are new users of Trace and are immediately up against an issue.   
We are modeling a building with VAV reheats and a dedicated OA unit,  
which is fine.  But we also have baseboard heat to combat leaky  
single pane wood windows (historic).  Trace doesn't allow two systems  
to be assigned to a room or zone.  Is there any way to model this?

Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

You may use VAV w/Baseboard Heating or VAV Reheat(30% Min Flow Default). However, you probably can't have both VAV reheat coil and baseboard heating in one system. I think it doesn't matter though, since the heating load from the window will ultimately be provided by  central plant , such as boiler. For TRACE, whether this envelope heating load is addressed by finned tube or VAV reheat coil will be the same for Boiler and Pump as central plant level.

You can also call TRACE tech support. They are very experienced and probably can give you more suggestions.

Chinmay,
 
My colleague Marlin Addison here at ASU does much of the eQUEST training for the Wisconsin Energy Center and for Southern California Edison and I'm sure would be interested in doing something on the east coast. Perhaps by way of your local ASHRAE or USGBC chapter a training session could be set-up, it might also be a money maker for the local chapters. You can contact Marlin at marlin.addison at asu.edu.

I really doubt that you will get a meaningful quantitative measurement. 
A qualitative measurement
might indicate current general problems on a particular section of the 
power grid.

As part of a senior level power plant design class in 1980 we visited a 
then already old coal
fired power plant. To adjust the phase of  the generator versus the grid 
they used a bridge with
two light bulbs. When both light bulbs were equally dim they remotely 
threw the generator mains
online. Well the week before our visit they had both light bulbs burn 
out at the same time during
an initialization.    Very fortunately it happened on the third shift 
and the place was just about deserted.
We saw many many low pressure stage turbine blades 48+ inches long 
embedded in the concrete
walls. That was just from a  ~ 10 degree or less miss match...
By the way, I never sit opposite the engines when I travel by air......

Message-ID: <657132743475A742B8DBDC59534F8A6F8FAF6B@Givenmail.givenandassociates.com>

I entered my model in the wizard and defined peak DHW use for this hotel
as a btu/sf value that EQUEST assigns a part load curve to.

 

Now I'm in the Detailed Editor and want to show a 98% condensing hot
water heater and differentiate from my base case generated at 80%
efficiency.  Where do I get to assign these differing efficiencies?

 

Thanks in advance for any assistance!

Since Eric has not "corrected" Mathew, I will:
The eQuest POWERED induction unit SYSTEM (i.e. TYPE = PIU) just refers to fan-powered reHEAT boxes in VAV systems. The eQuest INDUCTION UNIT SYSTEM models an archaic system that can be made somewhat analogous to modern ACTIVE chilled beam systems by overriding some of the system defaults. However, no matter what the user specifies in the zone, this simulates constant volume airflow to all connected zones whenever the central AHU is active. 
 
The natural ventilation system keywords only apply to PSZ and related SYSTEM types, so can only be utilized in the most basic small commercial building models. And I'm fairly certain wind direction is not considered even by the more sophisticated S-G method, among other shortcomings.

Eric, please correct me if I'm wrong but I though a chilled beam was an 
induction unit; and eQuest has both powered and non-powered induction 
units. Also, if you look at the HVAC units you input there is an Outdoor 
Air tab that will let you specify either an Air Change Rate or 
Sherman-Grimsrud Method (based on wind) for Natural Ventilation. Either 
method requires the creation of schedules, but I've found both to be 
effective.

I believe 1 / % boiler efficiency is the Heating EIR. So go to your
boiler tab on the Component tree when in the Water Side Module and input
the new Heating EIR.
 
I believe there are Condensing Boiler Curves in one of the BLDG-SIM
threads to also add to this. And I believe that under DOE2 HELP, there
is some discussion on such curves as well.
 
Good luck !!

I entered my model in the wizard and defined peak DHW use for this hotel
as a btu/sf value that EQUEST assigns a part load curve to.

 

Now I'm in the Detailed Editor and want to show a 98% condensing hot
water heater and differentiate from my base case generated at 80%
efficiency.  Where do I get to assign these differing efficiencies?

 

Thanks in advance for any assistance!

Currently, it is not possible to turn off the condensation shut-off  
for low temp radiant systems in EnergyPlus.  Greater flexibility over  
the condensation issue as well as an ability to bypass this feature  
for the low temp radiant system is currently being worked on.  It will  
hopefully be available in the next EnergyPlus release this spring.

Message-ID: <E81162D94AB7874ABE509EA0CF4D5198D0B81F@exchange.mdaengr.com>

Building simulations for EPACT credits require that the building energy
and power costs be reduced by 50%.  The tax credit has been extended to
2013.

 

The energy and power cost savings must come from a 16-2/3% reduction in
three categories: Building envelope, HVAC and SHW, and Lighting.  There
is a guideline called  "Energy Savings Modeling and Inspection
Guidelines for Commercial Building Federal Tax Deductions" Second
Edition, which is Technical Report NREL/TP-550-40467, May 2007.  

 

In this guideline, they describe the technique on pages 3 and 4 to
calculate the costs and % cost reductions due to the Lighting, and
HVAC/DHW electricity use.  Nowhere does it describe how they want you to
calculate the cost and cost reductions due to the building envelope,
despite the fact that 16-2/3% of the energy savings are required to come
from this category.

 

Does anybody know what to do for the building envelope and the EPACT
deduction?  

 

Has anyone seen a spreadsheet available already created to do the cost
allocations based on the outputs from a simulation program (in my case
Trane Trace 700)?  There are quite a few available for the simple
"Interim Lighting Rule" but none that I have found for the full model.

 

Also, in April 2008, an IRS Notice 2008-40 called "Amplification of
Notice 2006-52" describes being allowed to change the portion of the
savings for the building envelope to 10% if the Lighting and HVAC/DHW
savings are increased to 20% each (for a total remaining at 50% energy
and power cost reduction).

 

Has anybody seen this used?  I have searched around for examples of
EPACT and all places still reference the 16-2/3% thresholds.

When making a partial qualifier analysis, the other aspects of the proposed building are relaxed to match the baseline building.

If you are attempting an HVAC partial qualifier for instance, the proposed and baseline building would be identical for lighting design and envelope design, and you'd have to achieve 20% under the newer rules.  (16-2/3% for a building partially qualifying under the old rules.)

The 20% (16-2/3%) will then be wholly attributable to the HVAC systems.  To partially qualify for envelope, you'd repeat this process in a second set of simulations with the proposed envelope, but baseline lighting and HVAC while claiming 10% savings (16-2/3%).  Etc.

If your client had a whole-building qualifier, then you would have all different aspects of your proposed design incorporated, but have to achieve 50% savings.  The savings do not have to be allocated to each partial area in this case.

It won't be too hard to make a spreadsheet to show the savings.  Similar to what you might have done for any other ECB or Appendix G analysis.

Hey Nick:

 

The baseline for building envelope is 90.1-2001.  Construct your building as
built to that standard and calculate usage.  Your 50% (or whatever
percentage) savings is calculated based upon energy usage reduction
generated beyond that baseline not your actual building. 

 

Thanks,

Message-ID: <6AF9AFA739099A43B163308B4B0892A42CA0E050AF@VMBX107.ihostexchange.net>

Does anyone have recommendations on computer performance specs for reducing the run times?  When large models are run, the lengthy run time creates an annoyance when trying to debug issues in the model or perform parametric runs.

My idea was to create a modeling server from a decked out PC.  The hope being that I will be able to have other non-modeling programs running on my computer and perform the energy simulation remotely on the modeling server.  What combination of processor, RAM, Motherboard, video card, etc. would be ideal in creating a modeling server?  Could this modeling server be set up to run more than one eQUEST or EnergyPlus type simulation at a time?

My personal computer currently has a dual core processor, but I saw an email that said programs like EnergyPlus and eQUEST will only use one of the two cores.  Is there any program which can use both?  If not, would getting a higher performing single core processor be better?

Any advice on this topic would be much appreciated,

Hi Cramer:
 
I have never used TRNSYS, but I always had the impression it was more
process versus whole building oriented.
 
You will want to build your differently shaped floors in the Design
Development (DD) Wizard. The Schematic Wizard only allow on shape. In
the DD Wizard, you can trace AutoCAD DWG files to develop each floor.
My drift on the "shell" concept is that it is indeed a floor, where
there are several zones on the same level. The shell can also be the
floor of another building, thus the ability not only to to different
floor plans in the same building, but different buildings in the same
run.
 
Hope this gets you started.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] new to eQuest, need help with varying floor shapes


Hi All,
 
I'm new to eQuest, testing it out to see if we like it for some modeling
tasks over our current software (Trnsys). I'm trying to model a building
in which every floor has a different shape. Can someone tell me the best
way to approach this? Should each floor be a new shell? For that matter,
what is a 'shell', anyways? 
 
Thanks,
Cramer

Message-ID: <3BBCBF3E24390749A2059774C10007A202C40BFC@HMP107.hilson_moran.local>

Hi all,
I'm modelling an office building with a floor area of more than 240000
sf.
The baseline system is system 8 VAV w/PFP boxes and I will need 2
equally sized centrifugal chillers.
My question is: how do the 2 chillers interact? Both of them working at
half load or one working at full load and the second one only working
when the first one is not enough?

Message-ID: <000e01c971a4$7d098180$771c8480$@com>

Hi all,

 

I recently came across a Life Cycle Analysis of Suspended Ceilings vs. Open
Plenums, initiated by CISCA [Ceiling and Interior System Construction
Association ( www.cisca.org )] which concluded that suspended ceilings are
more energy efficient because they have:

 

a)      higher reflectances,

b)      better heat-removal from luminaires, and

c)       use lower static pressure and fan power.

 

I can understand (a) and (c) but (b) leaves me suspicious that the
return-air plenum was not considered in this study.  As I understand it,
return-air plenums can be defined as separate zones from the usable spaces
(in this case: an office or a food store) but the suspended ceilings are
adiabatic.  So , other than the savings for lighting and fan, I really don't
understand how there could be significant savings for the HVAC system if the
overall height of the rooms (plenum & usable space) is identical, and
cooling load of plenums are considered.  

 

Is there something I'm missing?

suspended ceilings.

Does your model include ducted return or plenum return?  If it is ducted
return the return air is pulled from the space and the light heat gain is
less load for the AHU.  If you have a plenum return the full lighting load
should be accounted for.

Dear Paul,
 
In theory, the return plenum is warmer than the occupied space, so the wall
and, especially, roof loads do not affect the space in the same way.  This
will give a warmer coil entering condition and resulting smaller coil,  fan,
duct, motor, wiring, electrical service, etc.
 
The ACTUAL difference will be small and may not be worth the additional
analysis and load calculations.  You could argue that a VAV system will
realize the benefits, since it will "see" the space load only and reduce
volume to suit.
 
Another consideration is whether the life cycle energy benefits outweigh the
differential cost to install and maintain the suspended ceiling....  I
suspect they do, but am uncertain re: ROI.

Thanks James,

 

I'm beginning to see how there could be a difference: especially since the
office modeled does use a VAV system and the food store is a single storey
building with 100,000 sq. ft roof.  It would seem that the roof loads have
the greater influence because its energy costs savings are 30 - 40% greater
than the 8-storey office building with 15,000 sq. ft. roof for four
locations (including Orlando), and 70% higher for Charlotte.

 

BTW, it is claimed that the life-cycle payback is between 5 - 11 years for
the office, and 0.9 - 1.7 years for the food store.

We did an EnergyPlus run time analysis for CEC based on E+ version 2.2. 
CEC is close to publishing the report. The report answers most of your

Subject: [Bldg-sim] EnergyPlus on multi-cpu systems
Message-ID: <bce4945b0901081430j36737e8akb5e5547f6fdafde3@mail.gmail.com>

Alex:
Just want to comment on the dual core issue.  Multiple E+ runs work nicely
on a dual core machine (and would subsequently work with four on a quad
core).  I wrote a testing script that monitors each processor on the machine
while constantly running two different E+ instances.  When only one runs, my
machine (Lenovo laptop, 2GHz Intel Core Duo, 3GB RAM, XP Professional)
doesn't notice anything is happening.  When both processors fill up, the
machine does lag, but not that bad to where it completely halts.  The issue
that most people come across when wanting to improve E+ performance is that
it can't easily be applied to run a single simulation on multiple computers.
 In a program like Fluent, for instance, the CFD grid can be split, and each
processor can simulate its part, and only need to communicate at the
interfaces.  For a building simulation like E+, there isn't really a logical
way to split the data, since each piece of equipment may need to know
information from all sorts of other parts of the simulation.

Two pieces of advice:

If you can get your parametric study to run two simulations (two instances
of EnergyPlus.exe) concurrently, that should nearly double the performance
on a dual core/dual processor machine.

While you are debugging your model, make sure you only run a single design
day, and not any run periods.  If the design days come through without
problems, the run period is **likely** to not have any either.  (key is the
**'s)

Subject: [Bldg-sim] EnergyPlus on multi-cpu systems, Standard E+ Machiine
Message-ID: <4966849A.7090804@cox.net>

Hi;

One of the simplest ways to speed production runs is to get several 
identical computers, install identical
copies of the desired software and perform "saw tooth" runs. In this 
strategy the user moves down one
machine about every 5 minutes starting another run. After all of the 
machines are running go back to the
first machine and wait for the results.As soon as the first machine is 
finished, load it and go again.

Quite a while ago I had a flexy manufacturing class as part of my 
master's degree program. The factory
simulation runs took a long time -- this was just as 486s were fading 
and Pentium CPUs were taking off.
the runs took ~ 40 minutes so I got 8 machines in the computer lab early 
in the morning on a Saturday. I
finished the projects in one morning. My classmates were crushing it all 
week.

We are interested in establishing a "standard configuration"  PC for 
efforts to speed up Energy Plus runs.
We are NOT interested in Equest, or TRACE, at this time.  We may have 
some interest in Retscreen, Window 5.
The system will be based on an Intel OEM motherboard, Intel CPU, and 
something that is not Vista.
Windows XP PRO is available to small OEMs through January 30 in the US. 
SuSE Linux looks like a
good alternative. I have looked at the NVIDIA  Tesla board that plugs 
into a PCIe x16 slot. That's
available retail at $1600 from Tigerdirect.com.   I don't want to create 
a $10,000 PC however.
What is the feeling on the mailing list concerning speed vs cost ??  Is 
a $2,000 PC OK?  $2,500 ??

One other feature we are looking at is providing Internet based training 
for Energy Plus, and Technical
Support. Establishing a standard machine or say two levels of standard 
machine, operating system, tools,
would greatly help the user community.

Message-ID: <175241C47FF8E141A7AC2637D952A66D02CAC97E08@ITUPC-EX1MBOX.UniNet.unisa.edu.au>

Hi

I am looking for some chiller performance curves at elevated evaporator temperatures for chilled ceiling systems in commercial buildings.  Manufacturers provide data up to 9 deg. C exit temperatures but not up to 15 deg. C.  Ideally COP values at different evaporator, condenser and load would be ideal for a water cooled chiller.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] chilled water pump power
Message-ID: <BAY136-W559FE78D433F40890040B5C2DC0@phx.gbl>


Hi,
 
I have a question regarding the chilled water pump power calculation in ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G:
 
ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Paragraph G3.1.3.10 requires that "The baseline building design pump power shall be 22 W/gpm.". If the chilled water pumping system is a primary-secondary system, how does this rule apply? i.e. does the 22 W/gpm apply to the primary pump, secondary pump, or both? Or, do I need to divide it between the primary and secondary pump?
 
Your suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
 
Thanks,
 
Dongyi

Good question!  My guess is that each pump may be 22W / gpm.  Since they are
required to use variable speed drives (for >300T), it won't affect energy
adversely.
 
There may be an ASHRAE clarification on this topic; have you checked with
them?

Message-ID: <5F662BF0C1928242BF324F3EE6C27D1431544D@exc01sfo1us.FKUSA.ORG>

Dear Bldg-sim
 
Is the lighting in an uncovered and unconditioned parking garage considered a process load? Where does it say that?
 
In terms of App G of ASHRAE 90.1 and LEED, does "regulated" refer to terms that are explicitly discussed in the standard? Since the standard states that exterior lighitng for Unconvered Parking Areas is limited 0.15 W/sf in Table 9.4.5, does that mean lighting in a parking lot is "regulated"? 
 
In general I'm looking for documentation of definitions for "Process Loads" and "Regulated" and "Unregulated" according to LEED...
 
Thank you in advance!
Happy New Year!
Linda

Dear Bill,
 
I don't think I follow your logic.  If the total plant head (primary plus
secondary) is ~100 ft., and assuming that water flow is about the same for
both primary and secondary, then your calcs indicate that 22W is a
reasonable number for the pumping system efficiency.
 
This is essentially the same scenario that I intended to use below.  The
primary side would use, say, 30ft of head and the secondary side would use
~70ft.  If the total head is greater than that, it (obviously) becomes
tougher to comply with 22W / gpm.
 
That said, I haven't modeled a System #7 or 8 per Appendix G yet, so I'm
just hypothesizing!
 
p.s., I think it will be tough to get a combined wire-water efficiency of
85%!

I sincerely doubt it.

A fairly typical total pump head for plant and distribution for a
primary/secondary systems might be 100 -120 ft.  (Note, I am not saying that
is GOOD practice, but it is typical.  One can generally do better.)

Let's say that the overall efficiency of pump, motor, and drive is ~85%.

If we use the common engineering approximation HP = (Q*H)/(3960*eta_t), and
given that 1 HP =  745.7 W, the power associated with 1 gpm and 100 ft wg
head is

W = 745.7*(1*100)/(3960*0.85) = 22.15

I cannot think of a reasonable scenario under which 44 W/gpm could be
construed to represent minimally acceptable practice.

Dear all:

I am facing problems in writing the inner data within the weather file.

Finally, It is easy to write the generated or measured data into a text file
then it is also easy to convert it into epw or even wea. But there seem some
errors within the original conversion from the original epw into text (csv)
which i started with to write in.  Consequently all the conversions later made
in the opposite direction from csv to epw conclude epw with inner writing
errors. 
This appear in the DesignBuilder or even in the ECOTECT.


The issue is what is the correct format with appropriate headers of the
location
long and lat, ....etc. So that the later conversions should read from any
package that uses epw or wea.  Can you gide to some one who is expert in such
data files issues? 

One of the problems that i found in DB, it doesn't accept any no. of days in
the
year 2002, i tried to delete the extra days once and twice but it didn't work.


A help would be appreciated.

Best regards,
Mohamad.

Hello Bill
 
You are correct. The 22 W/GPM is combined Primary and Secondary pumping.
The assumption that used to derive this number is total head of 75'.

One of the problems that i found in DB, it doesn't accept any no. of
days in the year 2002, i tried to delete the extra days once and twice
but it didn't work.


A help would be appreciated.

Best regards,
Mohamad.

Martin, let me try and understand your question a little better.

For different evaporator leaving temperatures you could simply contact
the manufacturers or as many have simply map the chiller as a
traditional Carnot cycle and deduce the efficiency from the
calculations.

I wrote a paper in 93 which is published in ASHRAE transactions dealing
with chilled beams and chiller efficiencies associated with running
chillers at say 13C-15C.

The only problem in the real world is that we often require at least 6C
for air handling units and to have a dedicated chiller for chilled
ceilings is a little extravagant. We usually run the chillers at 6C, but
at variable speed with of course variable evaporator flow. Bungane
Melamakulu and I wrote a paper on chiller efficiency for the IBPSA
conference in Colorado.

I do not wish this reply to seem as many replies that we have done this
before, but does this answer you question?

Hi

 

I am looking for some chiller performance curves at elevated evaporator
temperatures for chilled ceiling systems in commercial buildings.
Manufacturers provide data up to 9 deg. C exit temperatures but not up
to 15 deg. C.  Ideally COP values at different evaporator, condenser and
load would be ideal for a water cooled chiller.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Lab ACH Setback with Packaged Single Zone Systems
Message-ID: <C58CD3D1.4BC1%ktupper@rmi.org>

I am modeling a lab spaces for LEED, and the 90.1-2004 Baseline system is a
Packaged Single Zone. The lab spaces have 12 ACH during occupied periods,
and 6 ACH during unoccupied periods.

Using eQUEST, I cannot seem to get the supply airflow to vary between 12 and
6 ACH. I have fume hood exhaust schedules which control the OA flow rates,
and these are both varying between occupied and unoccupied hours.  I have
specified my Min Flow Ratio to 0.5 at the system level, set my Min ACH to 6
at the zone level, and assigned a Min Flow Schedule to the zone level
airflow that matches that of the fume hood exhaust schedule.

I have been outputting hourly variable to check how the  system is
performing and right now my supply air is constant at 12 ACH, while the OA
and EA varies between  6 and 12. Is there anyway to get the supply airflow
to vary on a PSZ?

I was able to get this to work in another model with a Reheat Fan System
that was serving multiple zones, but it doesn?t seem right to change the
system type.

Thank you,

Dear Dongyi,
 
I assign the actual flow (gpm or m3/s) and an equivalent head that results
in the ASHRAE pump power limit.  I've attached a spreadsheet which helps do
that for you more easily.
 
Note that I use EPlus and it assigns a fixed pump efficiency.  You'll have
to figure that out for your software.....

Message-ID: <90953C3B79F4294E9D11E9AB888B36DB15819911@EXCHSRV.lmsa.pt>

Dear Tianzhen,



Do you know if the report you mentioned will be made available on internet (where/when)? Are there any major conclusions that you can provide already, concerning the speeding up of simulations in Energy Plus? I guess that until the whole E+ is rewritten to allow multicore processing, your results could help everyone a lot!



Thanks in advance,

Jo?o Pedro Santos

Alex,



We did an EnergyPlus run time analysis for CEC based on E+ version 2.2.

CEC is close to publishing the report. The report answers most of your

questions.

Could this modeling server be set up to run more than one eQUEST or EnergyPlus type simulation at a time?

Alex:

Just want to comment on the dual core issue.  Multiple E+ runs work nicely

on a dual core machine (and would subsequently work with four on a quad

core).  I wrote a testing script that monitors each processor on the machine

while constantly running two different E+ instances.  When only one runs, my

machine (Lenovo laptop, 2GHz Intel Core Duo, 3GB RAM, XP Professional)

doesn't notice anything is happening.  When both processors fill up, the

machine does lag, but not that bad to where it completely halts.  The issue

that most people come across when wanting to improve E+ performance is that

it can't easily be applied to run a single simulation on multiple computers.

 In a program like Fluent, for instance, the CFD grid can be split, and each

processor can simulate its part, and only need to communicate at the

interfaces.  For a building simulation like E+, there isn't really a logical

way to split the data, since each piece of equipment may need to know

information from all sorts of other parts of the simulation.



Two pieces of advice:



If you can get your parametric study to run two simulations (two instances

of EnergyPlus.exe) concurrently, that should nearly double the performance

on a dual core/dual processor machine.



While you are debugging your model, make sure you only run a single design

day, and not any run periods.  If the design days come through without

problems, the run period is **likely** to not have any either.  (key is the

**'s)

Hi;



One of the simplest ways to speed production runs is to get several

identical computers, install identical

copies of the desired software and perform "saw tooth" runs. In this

strategy the user moves down one

machine about every 5 minutes starting another run. After all of the

machines are running go back to the

first machine and wait for the results.As soon as the first machine is

finished, load it and go again.



Quite a while ago I had a flexy manufacturing class as part of my

master's degree program. The factory

simulation runs took a long time -- this was just as 486s were fading

and Pentium CPUs were taking off.

the runs took ~ 40 minutes so I got 8 machines in the computer lab early

in the morning on a Saturday. I

finished the projects in one morning. My classmates were crushing it all

week.



We are interested in establishing a "standard configuration"  PC for

efforts to speed up Energy Plus runs.

We are NOT interested in Equest, or TRACE, at this time.  We may have

some interest in Retscreen, Window 5.

The system will be based on an Intel OEM motherboard, Intel CPU, and

something that is not Vista.

Windows XP PRO is available to small OEMs through January 30 in the US.

SuSE Linux looks like a

good alternative. I have looked at the NVIDIA  Tesla board that plugs

into a PCIe x16 slot. That's

available retail at $1600 from Tigerdirect.com.   I don't want to create

a $10,000 PC however.

What is the feeling on the mailing list concerning speed vs cost ??  Is

a $2,000 PC OK?  $2,500 ??



One other feature we are looking at is providing Internet based training

for Energy Plus, and Technical

Support. Establishing a standard machine or say two levels of standard

machine, operating system, tools,

would greatly help the user community.

Hi



I am looking for some chiller performance curves at elevated evaporator temperatures for chilled ceiling systems in commercial buildings.  Manufacturers provide data up to 9 deg. C exit temperatures but not up to 15 deg. C.  Ideally COP values at different evaporator, condenser and load would be ideal for a water cooled chiller.

Hi,



I have a question regarding the chilled water pump power calculation in ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G:



ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Paragraph G3.1.3.10 requires that "The baseline building design pump power shall be 22 W/gpm.". If the chilled water pumping system is a primary-secondary system, how does this rule apply? i.e. does the 22 W/gpm apply to the primary pump, secondary pump, or both? Or, do I need to divide it between the primary and secondary pump?



Your suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

Good question!  My guess is that each pump may be 22W / gpm.  Since they are

required to use variable speed drives (for >300T), it won't affect energy

adversely.



There may be an ASHRAE clarification on this topic; have you checked with

them?

Dear Bldg-sim



Is the lighting in an uncovered and unconditioned parking garage considered a process load? Where does it say that?



In terms of App G of ASHRAE 90.1 and LEED, does "regulated" refer to terms that are explicitly discussed in the standard? Since the standard states that exterior lighitng for Unconvered Parking Areas is limited 0.15 W/sf in Table 9.4.5, does that mean lighting in a parking lot is "regulated"?



In general I'm looking for documentation of definitions for "Process Loads" and "Regulated" and "Unregulated" according to LEED...



Thank you in advance!

Happy New Year!

Linda

Dear Bill,



I don't think I follow your logic.  If the total plant head (primary plus

secondary) is ~100 ft., and assuming that water flow is about the same for

both primary and secondary, then your calcs indicate that 22W is a

reasonable number for the pumping system efficiency.



This is essentially the same scenario that I intended to use below.  The

primary side would use, say, 30ft of head and the secondary side would use

~70ft.  If the total head is greater than that, it (obviously) becomes

tougher to comply with 22W / gpm.



That said, I haven't modeled a System #7 or 8 per Appendix G yet, so I'm

just hypothesizing!



p.s., I think it will be tough to get a combined wire-water efficiency of

85%!

I sincerely doubt it.



A fairly typical total pump head for plant and distribution for a

primary/secondary systems might be 100 -120 ft.  (Note, I am not saying that

is GOOD practice, but it is typical.  One can generally do better.)



Let's say that the overall efficiency of pump, motor, and drive is ~85%.



If we use the common engineering approximation HP = (Q*H)/(3960*eta_t), and

given that 1 HP =  745.7 W, the power associated with 1 gpm and 100 ft wg

head is



W = 745.7*(1*100)/(3960*0.85) = 22.15



I cannot think of a reasonable scenario under which 44 W/gpm could be

construed to represent minimally acceptable practice.

Dear all:



I am facing problems in writing the inner data within the weather file.



Finally, It is easy to write the generated or measured data into a text file

then it is also easy to convert it into epw or even wea. But there seem some

errors within the original conversion from the original epw into text (csv)

which i started with to write in.  Consequently all the conversions later made

in the opposite direction from csv to epw conclude epw with inner writing

errors.

This appear in the DesignBuilder or even in the ECOTECT.





The issue is what is the correct format with appropriate headers of the

location

long and lat, ....etc. So that the later conversions should read from any

package that uses epw or wea.  Can you gide to some one who is expert in such

data files issues?



One of the problems that i found in DB, it doesn't accept any no. of days in

the

year 2002, i tried to delete the extra days once and twice but it didn't work.





A help would be appreciated.



Best regards,

Mohamad.

Hello Bill



You are correct. The 22 W/GPM is combined Primary and Secondary pumping.

The assumption that used to derive this number is total head of 75'.

I sincerely doubt it.



A fairly typical total pump head for plant and distribution for a

primary/secondary systems might be 100 -120 ft.  (Note, I am not saying

that is GOOD practice, but it is typical.  One can generally do better.)



Let's say that the overall efficiency of pump, motor, and drive is ~85%.



If we use the common engineering approximation HP = (Q*H)/(3960*eta_t),

and given that 1 HP =  745.7 W, the power associated with 1 gpm and 100

ft wg head is



W = 745.7*(1*100)/(3960*0.85) = 22.15



I cannot think of a reasonable scenario under which 44 W/gpm could be

construed to represent minimally acceptable practice.

      Hi,



      I have a question regarding the chilled water pump power

calculation in ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G:



      ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Paragraph G3.1.3.10 requires that "The

baseline building design pump power shall be 22 W/gpm.". If the chilled

water pumping system is a primary-secondary system, how does this rule

apply? i.e. does the 22 W/gpm apply to the primary pump, secondary pump,

or both? Or, do I need to divide it between the primary and secondary

pump?



      Your suggestions will be greatly appreciated.



      Thanks,

Martin, let me try and understand your question a little better.



For different evaporator leaving temperatures you could simply contact

the manufacturers or as many have simply map the chiller as a

traditional Carnot cycle and deduce the efficiency from the

calculations.



I wrote a paper in 93 which is published in ASHRAE transactions dealing

with chilled beams and chiller efficiencies associated with running

chillers at say 13C-15C.



The only problem in the real world is that we often require at least 6C

for air handling units and to have a dedicated chiller for chilled

ceilings is a little extravagant. We usually run the chillers at 6C, but

at variable speed with of course variable evaporator flow. Bungane

Melamakulu and I wrote a paper on chiller efficiency for the IBPSA

conference in Colorado.



I do not wish this reply to seem as many replies that we have done this

before, but does this answer you question?

Hi







I am looking for some chiller performance curves at elevated evaporator

temperatures for chilled ceiling systems in commercial buildings.

Manufacturers provide data up to 9 deg. C exit temperatures but not up

to 15 deg. C.  Ideally COP values at different evaporator, condenser and

load would be ideal for a water cooled chiller.

I am modeling a lab spaces for LEED, and the 90.1-2004 Baseline system is a

Packaged Single Zone. The lab spaces have 12 ACH during occupied periods,

and 6 ACH during unoccupied periods.



Using eQUEST, I cannot seem to get the supply airflow to vary between 12 and

6 ACH. I have fume hood exhaust schedules which control the OA flow rates,

and these are both varying between occupied and unoccupied hours.  I have

specified my Min Flow Ratio to 0.5 at the system level, set my Min ACH to 6

at the zone level, and assigned a Min Flow Schedule to the zone level

airflow that matches that of the fume hood exhaust schedule.



I have been outputting hourly variable to check how the  system is

performing and right now my supply air is constant at 12 ACH, while the OA

and EA varies between  6 and 12. Is there anyway to get the supply airflow

to vary on a PSZ?



I was able to get this to work in another model with a Reheat Fan System

that was serving multiple zones, but it doesn?t seem right to change the

system type.



Thank you,

Dear Dongyi,



I assign the actual flow (gpm or m3/s) and an equivalent head that results

in the ASHRAE pump power limit.  I've attached a spreadsheet which helps do

that for you more easily.



Note that I use EPlus and it assigns a fixed pump efficiency.  You'll have

to figure that out for your software.....

Hi Itzhak,



If that is the assumption used to derive the 22 W/gpm, then how should I

divide it between the primary and secondary pump?

Hello Bill



You are correct. The 22 W/GPM is combined Primary and Secondary pumping. The

assumption that used to derive this number is total head of 75'.

I sincerely doubt it.



A fairly typical total pump head for plant and distribution for a

primary/secondary systems might be 100 -120 ft.  (Note, I am not saying that

is GOOD practice, but it is typical.  One can generally do better.)



Let's say that the overall efficiency of pump, motor, and drive is ~85%.



If we use the common engineering approximation HP = (Q*H)/(3960*eta_t), and

given that 1 HP =  745.7 W, the power associated with 1 gpm and 100 ft wg

head is



W = 745.7*(1*100)/(3960*0.85) = 22.15



I cannot think of a reasonable scenario under which 44 W/gpm could be

construed to represent minimally acceptable practice.

Good question!  My guess is that each pump may be 22W / gpm.  Since they are

required to use variable speed drives (for >300T), it won't affect energy

There may be an ASHRAE clarification on this topic; have you checked with

them?

Hi,



I have a question regarding the chilled water pump power calculation in

ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G:



ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Paragraph G3.1.3.10 requires that "The baseline

building design pump power shall be 22 W/gpm.". If the chilled water pumping

system is a primary-secondary system, how does this rule apply? i.e. does

the 22 W/gpm apply to the primary pump, secondary pump, or both? Or, do I

need to divide it between the primary and secondary pump?



Your suggestions will be greatly appreciated.



Thanks,



Dongyi

Thanks for the reply Linda; actually i don't use EnergyPlus: 

I had new global radiation data which is needed to be written in the weather
data data file. This will be used for indoor comfort simulation studies.

I used the ECOTECT5.6 conversion tool to have a csv. Hence the new data has been
written into this csv.  The opposite way is applied, Using ECOTECT conversion
tool to generate an epw to be used with DB later on.

DB at any way didn't accept the final epw with my data, it always say "year 2001
month2 has 32 days" despite i have removed these extra days many times !!


Any suggestions !!

Many thanks,
Mohamad.

	model
Message-ID: <9bf8eb3b0901091912v94a96fcwb366de5e31441ecf@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am working on the energy modeling of a non residential building of
conditioned area greater than 3,00,000 sq ft following ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix
G.
As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Table G3.1.1A it comes under system 8 , and ASHRAE
90.1-2004 Table G3.1.3.7 (Type and number of chillers) says that it should
be "2 centrifugal chillers minimum with chiller added so that no chiller is
larger than 800 tons, all sized equally."
After a sizing run of the model, the tonnage came out to be approximately
1000 tons.
I can divide this into 2 x 500 tons chiller or into 4 x 250 tons chillers.
In each case the COP of the chiller vary.
Which is the correct way of giving the size and number of chillers.

Thanks & Regards,

	Baseline Fan Systems
Message-ID: <343a1a270901100214i562ffe55s125528963e10f2e9@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I am curious how many systems or fan systems most of you usually create when
you model baseline systems?

I am particularly interested because under point G3.1.2.10 - Exhaust Air
Energy Recovery, one only has to apply an energy recovery device if a single
fan system is larger than 5000 cfm. I have not seen anywhere (please direct
me if there is indeed prescriptions for this in an ASHRAE publication)
guidelines for how many fan systems one has to model in a baseline building?
It seems that if I have a building with let's say 15000 cfm supply air, I am
free to model this building's baseline system with either 2 or 4 fan
systems? Then, if I model this building with 4 fan systems (each system
sized equally at 3750 cfm), I would not have to use energy recovery in the
baseline building, while if I choose to model the baseline with 2 fan
systems (each sized equally at 7500 cfm), then I must use energy recovery.

I would also appreciate input on a typical size of a fan system. If I have a
building that has a supply design air flow requirement of 100,000 cfm, how
many fan systems would typically be modeled? I am not too familiar with HVAC
design, and I tried looking for clues at manufacturers' websites but only
Carrier indicated an upper threshold of about 150 tons for their coils. Does
anyone have an experience with a typical airflow for a very hot climate over
a 150 ton coil? I am looking at System 8 for my baseline building, and I
imagine that for a large building (35 stories), several coils will be
installed. I am using Trace to do the energy model, and for some reason, the
more systems I model the higher the energy usage, keeping everything else
constant. Therefore I am interested in modeling several fan systems, if that
is common design practice.

Lastly, I would like to confirm that the design of the baseline system
beyond what is stipulated in Appendix G should comply with common practice?
In particular, numbers and sizes of systems does not seem to be much
discussed in Appendix G. Please let me know if you share my approach in
applying common design practices to size and locate equipment beyond
Appendix G prescriptions.

I appreciate any feedback you might have on these issues.

Faithfully yours,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1 Definition of "Conditioned" - The PRM Report
	for LEED EAc1 and Appendix G Energy Model
Message-ID: <343a1a270901100646t6c9d503rb36a278c97f0e1ac@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I would like to know if and how you consider ASHRAE's definition of
conditioned space on page 13 of the 2004 version.

Specifically, I am interested to know if you abide by this definition when
listing the conditioned vs unconditioned area? The definition seems really
specific to me, explaining how the system serving a conditioned area must
have a certain capacity per square foot of building area served. It even
goes on to explain how for some spaces one must consider the sum of the
products of various U-factors and wall areas. To me, it does not seem like
one can eyeball all these comparisons and definitions and therefore one has
to go ahead and measure the capacities of systems and compare them with the
area they serve, as well as do computations for rooms that might be
indirectly conditioned.

The PRM report for LEED requires you to list unconditioned and conditioned
areas separately. Do any of you actually go through the calculations to find
out if each single space in your project complies with the definitions put
forward in the 90.1 document? It seems to me like more effort than what it's
worth. I don't recall ever using this classification of unconditioned vs
conditioned anywhere else in the LEED certification process. Especially, I
don't recall ever having to use this definition to do the PRM model itself
under Appendix G. Has anyone come across another place than the PRM report
where the efforts of classifying their spaces accoring to the 90.1
definition above has been rewarded? Please also let me know if any one of
you have ever experienced trouble getting your project LEED certified
because of lack of compliance with this definition.

Lastly, the definition explicitly states that "Crawlspaces, attics, and
parking garages with natural or mechanical ventilation are not considered
enclosed spaces." Do most of you usually leave out car parks from the PRM
area report? I am working on a building where about 60% of the floor area is
parking space, meaning the sum total in my Space Summary will be much less
than stated otherwise in the documents submitted to USGBC. I know that they
are looking for all the total areas to be pretty consistent, and that some
people experience problems when thes total areas don't match up. Has anyone
ever dealt with this issue? If so, how did you deal with it?

I appreciate any response you may have to any or all of my questions.

Sincerely yours,

Good question...
 
Chris:
 
This is a tough one. To answer this I'm assuming that EQUEST uses the same reports at DOE-2.1e. If so, then
this applies, if not someone can correct me.
 
The answer lies in the DOE-2 system diagram, where you'll see that any sort of "plenum" that is used as a return
air path is actually a heat gain to the SYSTEM return air. Hence, it does not show on the LOADS report, only as
additional heat gain/loss in SYSTEMS when the system is operating. This is why the roof does not appear in the
LOADS report. For example, take a look at the SAMP1.INP file, run 3A. (...by the way...all the DOE-2 commands
are exercised one way or another in the SAMP files that come with DOE-2...with a few exceptions...).
 
If you are looking for the roof loads you'll have to connect the roof directly to the spaces (there are 5 in SAMP1.INP), and
declare the return path as direct or ducted. By switching back and forth, you can see the impact of the plenum.
 
This is not to say that plenums are trivial, as they are not. A plenum with thermal mass can be used for many interesting
things that can serve reasonably well as proxies for some rather complex models, for example passive solar. There's lots more
about this in the DOE-2 Newsletter archives at LBNL.
 
Jeff
 
FYI...I'll be teaching a webcast this semester on DOE-2 on M,W,F from 9:10 to 10:00 (central). All lectures will be recorded and I hope
to eventually hang some version of them on a web site somewhere. If anyone is interested in seeing the webcasts, please let me know 
a.s.a.p. (sorry for the short notice) and I'll see if we can open this up to a limited number of BLDG-SIM users.

I'm trying to find out where the heat conduction from the plenum to the conditioned space below appears in the eQuest simulation report.  LS-B shows the roof heat conduction into the plenum but for the conditioned space below LS-B shows no roof or ceiling conduction.  Can anyone tell me whether there is another report which does show this information.

Hi Guys!
We're? doing a LEED Core and Shell Project. 
1. Can anyone explain to me in detail the difference and use of Cooling
Capacity(kBTU/hr), Cooling Peak(kBTU/hr) and Cooling Energy(MBTU)? How can I
use these in LEED Submittals? 2. In Visual DOE File Reports(referring to Fan
Energy Part Load Consumption Summary), shall i add the Fan kwh consumption
for heating, for cooling, for heating and cooling and for floating to get
the annual consumption of that
specific fan/system? Is this the proper way of doing this?
Others:
3. Can we use Visual DOE in modeling CHILLED BEAMS? How? Which system from
the
Selection can we use for such? What could possibly be the inputs for these
Systems that is applicable from the input selection of the selected SYSTEM
ALTERNATIVE for CHILLED BEAMS?? ? 
4. How about the inputs for Energy Transfer Station like Pumps and Heat
Exchangers? Where can I see this? Is this already available in Visual DOE?
Usual
Configuration for projects served by district cooling.
Sorry for the number of questions that I have here.
Hope you can assist me on these.
Thanks everyone. You help is very much appreciated

Hey All,

I am curious as to how to break up the thermal blocks in eQUEST. eQUEST allows each zone to be broken down into different space types by percentage. According to Appendix G, Table G3.1, Section 7, three conditions have to be met in order to clump thermal blocks together: the space use classification has to be the same, they have to have exposure to one fa?ade (or a fa?ade with a <45 deg bend), and they have to be served by the same type of HVAC equipment. When a large zone is created based on the area being conditioned by a HVAC system, breaking down the spaces by the percentage doesn't meet the three conditions required. If spaces are broken down according to the ASHRAE requirements, it often leads to a large amount of zones. If all zones have at least 1 hr. of unmet heating or cooling, and there are greater then 300 zones, the model will exceed the amount of hours allowed. Any suggestions on an approach on zoning to simplify the model that meets ASHRAE requirements?

Thanks,
Janne

Hi Janne,

 

For figuring out the unmet load hours, the 300 hours per year is out of the 8,760 hours simulated. If every zone in the building simultaneously experiences an unmet load (such as when heating is first turned on after the building is allowed to get very cold), that only counts as one hour (or maybe two or three for a heat pump). The BEPS and BEPU DOE 2.2 reports show the percent of hours outside of throttling range. My understanding is that if this value is 3.4% or less (300/8760) than the condition is met.

Below is an email which I believe best describes the intent of unmet load hours and how to figure out how many there are in a given project. I have always used the same practice with positive results.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Spam:Re: LEED NC Submittal Template,Heating/Cooling Hours Loads Not Met

 

There are two things that need to be separated.

1.	What are the Appendix G requirements for "unmet load hours"
2.	Where does one find the information from the output report of the software? 

  

1. Appendix G requirements

 

The main purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the equipment is not undersized and does not result in too high unmet load hours. Undersized equipment consumes less energy along with resulting in large unmet load hours (depending upon the location). Moreover, if the difference between the baseline and proposed unmet load hours is high, it can either penalize or benefit the savings (hence the requirement that the difference shall not exceed 50 hours between the baseline and proposed case).

 

When one sizes equipment, it is done for the worse case scenario, meaning if it can meet the loads of the worst zone then it would be able to meet the loads of other zones. Therefore, looking at the worst zone would make sense.

 

Having said that, one also needs to keep in mind, there are various building types using a variety of HVAC systems that use Appendix G. Some are 24/7 facilities and some are schools or offices, etc. Some use zonal systems and some have an AHU per floor or one AHU for the whole building. I am not an authority on Appendix G, however, to me it seems appropriate that the Appendix G requirement is for the whole project and not for the worse zone.

 

For a large project, with large number of zones, the total unmet cooling/heating hours can well exceed 8760. If this is what the simulation results show then it is an indication-either the system is highly undersized or there is something wrong with how the system has been modeled or both!

 

As a practice, I always look at the SS-R reports and add the unmet cooling hours for the whole project and I maintain them well below 300 and similarly I add all the unmet heating hours and maintain the total well below 300 for the whole project. And I also make sure that the difference between both the proposed and baseline is below 50 fro both heating and cooling. I formed this habit when I was single and I didn't have a life. Although I am married now, but I still maintain this habit (till my wife threatens to abandon me!)  

 

 

2. Output from the simulation software (eQuest)

 

The BEPS/ BEPU reports show the worst zone scenario. Please look at SS-R report; identify the worse zone- (the zone which has the largest unmet load hours, determined by adding the unmet cooling and heating hours). Add unmet cooling hours and unmet heating hours of this zone, divide this number by the Total Run Hours also shown on the SS-R report and calculate the percentage. The same percentage is reported on the BEPS/ BEPU reports as "Percent of Hours Any System Zone Outside of Throttling Range".

 

The total run hours in the SS-R report equal the hours the fan operate (for a typical office building the fans run 11 hours each day from 7am to 6pm). Typically it would be ~2761 hours and not 8760 hours based upon the following formula:

11hrs * 5 days/week * 52 weeks a year - 11hrs * # of holidays + # of hours during the unoccupied hrs when fans turn on to maintain setback temperature.

 

 

Thanks and Happy Friday!

 

Best regards,

 

 

Gaurav Mehta

p.s.,
 
You can get a custom air handler and coils with almost any capacity you can
dream of.  In the case of coils, multiple coils can be used in a single air
handler. It's not so common to use very large air handlers because of space
restraints and distribution issues, but there are plenty of them in use.
Once again, the model doesn't care about physical size, only physics :)

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G - Exhaust Air Energy Recovery/Number
ofBaseline Fan Systems


Dear All,

I am curious how many systems or fan systems most of you usually create when
you model baseline systems? 

I am particularly interested because under point G3.1.2.10 - Exhaust Air
Energy Recovery, one only has to apply an energy recovery device if a single
fan system is larger than 5000 cfm. I have not seen anywhere (please direct
me if there is indeed prescriptions for this in an ASHRAE publication)
guidelines for how many fan systems one has to model in a baseline building?
It seems that if I have a building with let's say 15000 cfm supply air, I am
free to model this building's baseline system with either 2 or 4 fan
systems? Then, if I model this building with 4 fan systems (each system
sized equally at 3750 cfm), I would not have to use energy recovery in the
baseline building, while if I choose to model the baseline with 2 fan
systems (each sized equally at 7500 cfm), then I must use energy recovery.

I would also appreciate input on a typical size of a fan system. If I have a
building that has a supply design air flow requirement of 100,000 cfm, how
many fan systems would typically be modeled? I am not too familiar with HVAC
design, and I tried looking for clues at manufacturers' websites but only
Carrier indicated an upper threshold of about 150 tons for their coils. Does
anyone have an experience with a typical airflow for a very hot climate over

Dear Ulrik,
 
My understanding of G3.1.2.10 is this:
If the actual fan system exceeds 5K CFM (and the other criteria listed in
that paragraph), you must use energy recovery in your energy model for the
baseline.
 
You might choose to model four 5K systems as a single system as long as the
occupancy, internal loads, etc. are essentially the same.  This will not
affect the actual system, of course, but may save modeling time, and will
not affect calculation results.
 
I combine HVAC system in my models when the operational and other criteria
are the same.  There is no accuracy benefit to splitting them and it costs
valuable computational time (mine, too!)   For example, if a high rise
building has a separate air handler on each of 20 floors, and all floors are
office occupancy with the same lighting, computers and schedule ... I model
it as a single air handler.  Typically, the ground floor and top (roof)
floor are kept separate. 
 
Of course, one of the conveniences of modeling a building before it's in
actual operation is that you can make these types of simplifying
assumptions.  That doesn't work when you must match the modeling
calculations to actual energy bills!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G - Exhaust Air Energy Recovery/Number
ofBaseline Fan Systems


Dear All,

I am curious how many systems or fan systems most of you usually create when
you model baseline systems? 

I am particularly interested because under point G3.1.2.10 - Exhaust Air
Energy Recovery, one only has to apply an energy recovery device if a single
fan system is larger than 5000 cfm. I have not seen anywhere (please direct
me if there is indeed prescriptions for this in an ASHRAE publication)
guidelines for how many fan systems one has to model in a baseline building?
It seems that if I have a building with let's say 15000 cfm supply air, I am
free to model this building's baseline system with either 2 or 4 fan
systems? Then, if I model this building with 4 fan systems (each system
sized equally at 3750 cfm), I would not have to use energy recovery in the
baseline building, while if I choose to model the baseline with 2 fan
systems (each sized equally at 7500 cfm), then I must use energy recovery.

I would also appreciate input on a typical size of a fan system. If I have a
building that has a supply design air flow requirement of 100,000 cfm, how
many fan systems would typically be modeled? I am not too familiar with HVAC
design, and I tried looking for clues at manufacturers' websites but only
Carrier indicated an upper threshold of about 150 tons for their coils. Does
anyone have an experience with a typical airflow for a very hot climate over
a 150 ton coil? I am looking at System 8 for my baseline building, and I
imagine that for a large building (35 stories), several coils will be
installed. I am using Trace to do the energy model, and for some reason, the
more systems I model the higher the energy usage, keeping everything else
constant. Therefore I am interested in modeling several fan systems, if that
is common design practice.

Lastly, I would like to confirm that the design of the baseline system

Dear Ulrik,
 
Regarding "conditioned space":
 
"Conditioned space" seems pretty straightforward to me.  If, for example,
the cooling system for a 10,000 sq.ft. space has 10 tons cooling capacity,
then the capacity is 12Btu/hr/ft2 (10tons x 12,000 Btu/hr/ton / 10,000 ft2)
This exceeds the ASHRAE threshold of 5 Btu/h/ft2, so it's "conditioned".  If
the cooling system was only 4 tons, it would not be "conditioned" (only 4.8
Btu/hr/ft2).
 
The definition depends only indirectly on "U" values and wall areas.  For
any given construction, you choose to provide an air conditioning system or
not.  You can also choose to cool a lot or a little.  Each choice affects
whether you end up with an air conditioning system greater than 5 Btu/hr/ft2
or not.
 
Heating works the same way, except the threshold varies by climate zone.

Reportfor LEED EAc1 and Appendix G Energy Model


Dear All,

I would like to know if and how you consider ASHRAE's definition of
conditioned space on page 13 of the 2004 version.

Specifically, I am interested to know if you abide by this definition when
listing the conditioned vs unconditioned area? The definition seems really
specific to me, explaining how the system serving a conditioned area must
have a certain capacity per square foot of building area served. It even
goes on to explain how for some spaces one must consider the sum of the
products of various U-factors and wall areas. To me, it does not seem like
one can eyeball all these comparisons and definitions and therefore one has
to go ahead and measure the capacities of systems and compare them with the
area they serve, as well as do computations for rooms that might be
indirectly conditioned.

The PRM report for LEED requires you to list unconditioned and conditioned
areas separately. Do any of you actually go through the calculations to find
out if each single space in your project complies with the definitions put
forward in the 90.1 document? It seems to me like more effort than what it's
worth. I don't recall ever using this classification of unconditioned vs
conditioned anywhere else in the LEED certification process. Especially, I
don't recall ever having to use this definition to do the PRM model itself
under Appendix G. Has anyone come across another place than the PRM report
where the efforts of classifying their spaces accoring to the 90.1
definition above has been rewarded? Please also let me know if any one of
you have ever experienced trouble getting your project LEED certified
because of lack of compliance with this definition.

Lastly, the definition explicitly states that "Crawlspaces, attics, and
parking garages with natural or mechanical ventilation are not considered
enclosed spaces." Do most of you usually leave out car parks from the PRM
area report? I am working on a building where about 60% of the floor area is
parking space, meaning the sum total in my Space Summary will be much less
than stated otherwise in the documents submitted to USGBC. I know that they
are looking for all the total areas to be pretty consistent, and that some
people experience problems when thes total areas don't match up. Has anyone
ever dealt with this issue? If so, how did you deal with it?

I appreciate any response you may have to any or all of my questions.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. James V. Dirkes II:

Could you please clarify what you mean by "The definition depends only
indirectly on "U" values and wall areas?" I am not designing the mechanical
system, I am only reviewing it. Therefore I can't chose which spaces to
condition. The building has many rooms that don't have any cooling coils,
nor do they have any cold air entering the rooms. These must surely be
indirectly conditioned spaces?

For these indirectly conditioned spaces, I am wondering if I need to perform
the U-factor and surface area calculations and comparisons? The spaces in
question surely are not ventilated with 3 ACH from conditioned spaces. As
there are quite a few of these spaces, I just wanted to know if it is really
common practice to perform these calculations?

Thank you for a quick reply.

Sincerely yours,

Now your question becomes more clear!  If your principal concern is
"indirectly conditioned space", I'll say that:

*	

	I'm making some assumptions without seeing your floor plan, mostly
because I'm not sure why there would be a significant number of spaces which
have no ventilation, heating or cooling.
*	

	Any "non-conditioned" space within an otherwise conditioned area
will become cool or warm because of heat transfer from the adjoining spaces.
Effectively this means that the main heating / cooling plant serves this
"non-conditioned" area regardless of whether there is ductwork, fan coils,
etc.  Therefore, if you want to properly predict the heating / cooling
energy, you must include the heat transfer to and from these
"non-conditioned" areas.  I think that's all ASHRAE is trying to account for
in their definition.
*	

	The energy model, as a result, should include these
"non-conditioned" areas with appropriate definitions for the wall
construction and internal mass.  The airflow and heating / cooling capacity
can be zero or perhaps the setpoints can be chosen such that no heating or
cooling will ever be required...

p.s., I don't know about "common practice" since I'm one consultant among
many and have never discussed it with others.  If the "non-conditioned"
spaces are a very small portion of the overall area, perhaps they can be
ignored in the energy model.  If not, they should be included.  Regardless,
the USGBC reviewer will have the final say on the matter.  I hope this
helps!

Hi Jeff:
?
I do not believe the DOE-2.1E samples were translated into DOE-2.2 But most of the output reports did make it.

Good question...
?
Chris:
?
This is a tough one. To answer this I'm assuming that EQUEST uses the same reports at DOE-2.1e. If so, then
this applies, if not someone can correct me.
?
The answer lies in the DOE-2 system diagram, where you'll see that any sort of "plenum" that is used as a return
air path is actually a heat gain to the SYSTEM return air. Hence, it does not show on the LOADS report, only as
additional heat gain/loss in SYSTEMS when the system is operating. This is why the roof does not appear in the
LOADS report. For example, take a look at the SAMP1.INP file, run 3A. (...by the way...all the DOE-2 commands
are exercised one way or another in the SAMP files that come with DOE-2...with a few exceptions...).
?
If you are looking for the roof loads you'll have to connect the roof directly to the spaces (there are 5 in SAMP1.INP), and
declare the return path as direct or ducted. By switching back and forth, you can see the impact of the plenum.
?
This is not to say that plenums are trivial, as they are not. A plenum with thermal mass can be used for many interesting
things that can serve reasonably well as proxies for some rather complex models, for example passive solar. There's lots more
about this in the DOE-2 Newsletter archives at LBNL.
?
Jeff
?
FYI...I'll?be teaching a webcast this semester on DOE-2 on M,W,F from 9:10 to 10:00 (central). All lectures will be recorded and I hope
to eventually hang some version of them on a web site somewhere. If anyone is interested in seeing the webcasts, please let me know 
a.s.a.p. (sorry for the short notice) and I'll see if we can open this up to a limited number of?BLDG-SIM users.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Heat conduction from plenum into conditioned space





I?m trying to find out where the heat conduction from the plenum to the conditioned space below appears in the eQuest simulation report.? LS-B shows the roof heat conduction into the plenum but for the conditioned space below LS-B shows no roof or ceiling conduction.? Can anyone tell me whether there is another report which does show this information.
?
Thanks,

I am working on a renovated building and am wondering whether the

baseline exterior wall should be the current existing wall or the

baseline wall system as described by ASHRAE 90.1.  If it matters, we are

going for LEED NC points because of the extent of the renovation, not

LEED EB.







Does anyone have any experience with this?

It seems like you're thinking of what needs to be done for district energy.

According to ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G, "For existing building envelopes, the baseline building design shall reflect existing conditions prior to any revisions that are part of the scope of work being evaluated".

You may be right in that it's been changed in a CIR, although they tend to make things easier for the project team most of the time.

Dear Mr. James V. Dirkes II:

Maybe we are using two different simulation programs? I am using Trace 700.
I have confirmed by experiments that the size of the system, or rather the
number of systems, has a significant impact on annual energy consumption.
For certain system types, this should not even be that case, but somehow, in
the calculation procedures of the software, the number of systems somehow
enters the calculations and affects the results. I know it should not be
this way and I have warned the engineers at Trane about the behavior.

Regarding the sizes of coils and fans in air handlers, I was really looking
for a specific value. In a 40 story office building, for example, what are
typical ventilation fan sizes? Does 10,000 cfm sound like a reasonable fan
sizes?

Thank you for helping me out!

Sincerely yours,

Hello,

 

I have seen a few prior posts regarding eQuest oversizing a chiller
where the chiller runs only in the lower part-loads (in my case up to
50%) even though it appears through the inputs that eQuest should be
autosizing the chiller. I have not see answers or solutions to this
problem. Has anyone out there figured this out yet?

Thanks,

Appendix G, Addendum u, provides direction on determining the number of fan systems for the baseline building.
For convenience, it states:
"For systems 1, 2, 3 & 4, each thermal block shall be modeled with its own HVAC system.? For systems 5, 6,7 and 8, each floor shall be modeled with a separate HVAC system.? Floors with identical thermal blocks can be grouped for modeling purposes.

There are a few CIRs out there also regarding how the above gets tempered with reality when the rules above generate a?fan system size that is too large to be met by a single unit in reality.? As I recall, LEED didn't really seem to care about that and directed the modeller to just use the App G, Add u rules for sizing.? If you run into modelling limitations though, that seems to be a?different story and is an acceptable reason to then use multiple units.? But, my memory could be off.? Best to check the CIRs on line.

Dear Mr. James V. Dirkes II:

Maybe we are using two different simulation programs? I am using Trace 700. I have confirmed by experiments that the size of the system, or rather the number of systems, has a significant impact on annual energy consumption. For certain system types, this should not even be that case, but somehow, in the calculation procedures of the software, the number of systems somehow enters the calculations and affects the results. I know it should not be this way and I have warned the engineers at Trane about the behavior.

Regarding the sizes of coils and fans in air handlers, I was really looking for a specific value. In a 40 story office building, for example, what are typical ventilation fan sizes? Does 10,000 cfm sound like a reasonable fan sizes?

Thank you for helping me out!

Sincerely yours,

You can get a custom air handler and coils with almost any capacity you can dream of.? In the case of coils, multiple coils can be used in a single air handler. It's not so common to use very large air handlers because of space restraints and distribution issues, but there are plenty of them in use.? Once again, the model doesn't care about physical size, only physics :)

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G - Exhaust Air Energy Recovery/Number ofBaseline Fan Systems


Dear All,

I am curious how many systems or fan systems most of you usually create when you model baseline systems? 

I am particularly interested because under point G3.1.2.10 - Exhaust Air Energy Recovery, one only has to apply an energy recovery device if a single fan system is larger than 5000 cfm. I have not seen anywhere (please direct me if there is indeed prescriptions for this in an ASHRAE publication) guidelines for how many fan systems one has to model in a baseline building? It seems that if I have a building with let's say 15000 cfm supply air, I am free to model this building's baseline system with either 2 or 4 fan systems? Then, if I model this building with 4 fan systems (each system sized equally at 3750 cfm), I would not have to use energy recovery in the baseline building, while if I choose to model the baseline with 2 fan systems (each sized equally at 7500 cfm), then I must use energy recovery.

I would also appreciate input on a typical size of a fan system. If I have a building that has a supply design air flow requirement of 100,000 cfm, how many fan systems would typically be modeled? I am not too familiar with HVAC design, and I tried looking for clues at manufacturers' websites but only Carrier indicated an upper threshold of about 150 tons for their coils. Does anyone have an experience with a typical airflow for a very hot climate over a 150 ton coil? I am looking at System 8 for my baseline building, and I imagine that for a large building (35 stories), several coils will be installed. I am using Trace to do the energy model, and for some reason, the more systems I model the higher the energy usage, keeping everything else constant. Therefore I am interested in modeling several fan systems, if that is common design practice.

Lastly, I would like to confirm that the design of the baseline system beyond what is stipulated in Appendix G should comply with common practice? In particular, numbers and sizes of systems does not seem to be much discussed in Appendix G. Please let me know if you share my approach in applying common design practices to size and locate equipment beyond Appendix G prescriptions.

I appreciate any feedback you might have on these issues.

Faithfully yours,


Ulrik Welle-Strand Horn

This raises a few questions:

 

1.   What is the most effective way to use CO2 sensors to dramatically

3.	What is the most effective way to use CO2 monitoring in a building
with 40 classrooms and other large spaces.  If one sensor is triggered,
won't the entire zone get fresh air and defeat the energy savings? 

 

4.	If every classroom has a sensor, does any one have experience with
the replaceable / Mail in sensors to assure their accuracy.

James,
I disagree with the claim that R-value has little effect. Look at the number of all-glass buildings in northern climate, and I'll bet they barely meet LEED or ASHRAE energy pre-reqs.  
 
However, there is definitely a law of diminishing return at work. That is, after a certain R-value, additional insulation has very little effect. The curve of R-value vs. energy savings flatlines.  In our case in Toronto, this happens beyond R-20 walls and R-30 roofs typically.
 
The other thing to keep in mind is the type of building.  Offices are very much dependant on skin losses, but hospitals for example are dominated by ventilation loads and envelope losses are almost insignificant by comparison.
 
As for your question on CO2 control, our experince has shown that you need a very fine resulution to get any benefit.  That is for a mixed-air system, you typically need one sensor per box/damper, so that you're not over-ventilating the rest as you pointed out.  But mixed-air system are bad anyway so CO2 control is a marginal improvement.  You get the most bang if you de-couple the ventilation from the heating/cooling by using compartmental system such as fan-coils or distributed heat-pumps.  Why these systems aren't more popular in our market is beyond me...

Hi Ramana,

 

I think I know what you are trying to do; you are trying to get images
such as these:

 

http://ecotect.com/products/ecotect/features/solar

 

I was also struggling with this and now I believe the key is that you
*do not* use the Analysis Grid at all.  Instead of calculating incident
solar radiation for the Analysis Grid after stretching it over a
surface, you calculate it for Selected Surfaces under the "What should
values be calculated for?" dialogue in the Solar Access Analysis wizard.
Before you do this, however, you need to break up the surface using the
Surface Subdivision module.  You select the building and then go to
Modify, Surface Subdivision, Rectangular Tiles.  This should allow you
to calculate radiation over a whole surface without worrying about
stretching the grid.  There seems to be a limit as to how far around
something the grid can be stretched with the 3D Form Fit option. 

 

Hope this helps,

Dear all,

Has anyone tried assigning analysis grid to multiple surfaces with
different orientations/tilt angles (roofs and walls) at once to do the
incident solar radiation calculation in Ecotect? I have not been able to
do it well in my first few attempts. I've noticed that a single surface
with analysis grid assigned works fine.

Dear Bldg-Sim folk,
 
The insulation issue is one where more is NOT necessarily better, as is
indicated in Mr. Spielvogel's attachment.  For a "standard" building type
such as an office, it won't be too hard to assign an average density of
lighting and plug loads, use the favored HVAC system, and then tinker with
the "R" value to see where "optimum" is found.  Climate does make a
difference, as is also indicated in the article.
 
LEED, for the record, seems to give this interaction between envelope and
internal loads its due because the required energy analysis will  account
for these factors.  To be rigorous, though, you need to use a realistic
level of lighting and plug loads, NOT the connected load!
 
Another factor which I think ASHRAE 90.1 includes is the bridging effect of
many wall constructions.  Wood studs in residential construction, for
example, consume 15%-20% or more of the wall area and have very little
insulation value, degrading the overall average insulation value.  Steel
studs do the same thing in commercial construction.

Message-ID: <102dbb810901142007i7479ea4fuababb2d0cc98504b@mail.gmail.com>

I have a model which has three types of fan powered terminal units:
1. Underfloor constant volume units with heating coil - The fan turns on
when heating is needed, and uses only recirc air with 10% primary air
In equest, model this with parallel FPB - min heating flow set at 10%, and
zone fan cfm at 150; set the schedule to the space heating schedule. Will
this make sure that the fan comes on only for heating?
2. Series constant volume fan with heating coil, with varying primary air
from 100% to 30%.
 In equest, model this with series FPB - min heating flow set at 100%, and
zone fan ratio set to 1.
Question is if the primary air is at 30%, does the seconday air make up the
70% and the fan is modelled as constant volume, or is it variable volume?
3. Parallel variable volume fan with heating coil sized for 50% cfm, varying
primary air from 100% to 30%.
 In equest, model this with parallel FPB - min heating flow set at 50%, and
zone fan ratio set to 0.5.
What schedule temperature to use such that the fan is used for both heating
and cooling?

Does this seem reasonable? Any thoughts appreciated.

Hello,
 
I'm currently running a model for a restaurant and was trying to
manipulate the water-side HVAC to account for a process load
(dishwasher).  I'm relatively new to eQUEST and made a mistake that lead
to the following BDL error message:
 
Dishwasher cannot be specified as a PRIMARY-LOOP due to incorrect
SUBTYPE; valid PRIMARY-LOOP must have a SUBTYPE of PRIMARY
 
I have tried to fix the error, but every time I try to change the
primary loop, delete the loop, or any other alteration eQUEST will
automatically shut down and I can't make the changes so I'm basically
sitting on a useless model at the moment.  Does anyone have any
suggestions?

You might want to check the .bdl for error. Fix it in the input file and
then open equest.

Hello,

 

I am modeling two separate buildings in eQuest in one model and need to
apply an electrical coincident demand ratchet to each separately? The
coincident demand ratchet is different from the facility demand ratchet
in that the times of the coincident demand are set by the utility
whereas the facility demand ratchet is just whenever the building peaks.


 

I have set up and applied this coincident demand to the main electrical
meter and have set up submeters for the two buildings but don't know if
eQuest can apply this ratchet to the submeters. 

 

Thanks in advance for your help!

Hi All,

I'm currently working on a model that has CO2 sensing in a few large high occupancy spaces. When I select DCV Return Sensor with a minimum OA sizing method of 'Sum of Zone OA', it drives up the energy consumption of my electric centrifugal open chillers during the winter months (this is in climate zone 5A). But without the DCV Return Sensor, there is no space cooling energy consumption during the winter months. It appears as if the DCV Return Sensor is overriding the Enthalpy Economizer with a drybulb high limit of 70F. Does anyone have any insight into what is happening?

Thank You,
Janne

Hi Dan - eQUEST raw input files are ASCII text files and can be edited with
any test editor. Open the <filename>.INP in the eQUEST project directory.
Search for Dishwasher. Delete the entry that includes that reference. It
should be in the section where all loops are developed. All commands end
with "..", so you will be deleting everything following the ".." above and
including the ".." for that loop. Be sure that the file is saved as text.
When you reload it in eQUEST, the issue should be gone and you will need to
redefine the loop. I would make a copy of the INP file  before messing with
it just to be safe.

 

FYI, process loads should be defined in the "Process / DHW Loads" tab of the
primary loop, in this case heating. Also, keep in mind that the loop will
need to flow whenever a process or DHW load occurs, even if there is no
heating load. This can add pump usage and loop loses to your project.

I believe eQuest can apply different rates to different meters. Even if the rates are set up the same, call your second Rate "-2" or something, but set them up as different rates, even if they are exactly the same in content. Then apply the individual rates, with the individual ratchets, taxes, etc., to the individual meters. 
?
It should work.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] CO2 sensing in practice
Message-ID: <49745D15.3020603@zed-uk.com>

Hi

I've just received some tech info on CO2 measurement (NDIR) and was 
wondering what accuracy was realistic for these devices in practice. 
I've heard of calibration problems with CO2 and want to model it in a 
way that it will respond in the real world.

OK... A suppliers device measures the 0 - 2000ppm range and returns a 
signal of 0 - 10V range. ASHRAE 62.1 IAQ method stipulates limits in the 
range of 0 - 2000ppm as acceptable health guidelines depending on where 
your building is - great. However, Appendix C also suggests that if CO2 
is used as a surrogate for occupant odour, odours become apparent as low 
as 750ppm. Therefore, it would be best to have the detectors come on 
before this.

The signal in this range will be less than 2 Volts. Therefore, is it 
unrealistic that my model "senses" levels of CO2 in the range 350 
(ambient) - 750ppm?

If not, are there more accurate commercially viable alternatives?

Best regards

Chris Yates

Message-ID: <7F3D10949562FE448CAE07E9758469061BA86A@AESVR01.ambient-e.local>

Hi All,

 

I have a specific question about using Appendix G3.1.2.9 to calculate
baseline system fan power (I have already searched previous posts and
could not find the answer I'm looking for).  So, the Appendix G section
reads as follows: System fan electrical power for supply, return,
exhaust, and relief (excluding power to fan powered VAV boxes) shall be
calculated using the following formulas.  I understand the formulas,
which essentially use a fan CFM to determine a brake horsepower BHP,
which is then used to calculate the fan power (Watts), but my question
is this:  Supposing you have an HVAC system with supply, return, and
small exhaust fans (in restrooms, for example) - how do you calculate
the power to each fan?

 

Option 1:  Use your supply fan cfm to calculate a power, say it comes to
10 kW, and use this as your total "system" fan power.  This 10 kW, being
your whole system power, is then distributed among all of your system
fans however you desire (For example, supply fan power = 5 kW, return
fan power = 4 kW, exhaust fan power = 1 kW, for a total of 10 kW for the
fan system)

 

OR

 

Option 2:  Use each supply, return, and exhaust fan cfm to separately
calculate an individual kW for each fan (For example, supply fan power =
10 kW using the supply cfm, return fan power = 9 kW using the return
cfm, exhaust fan power = 1 kW using the exhaust cfm, for a total of 20
kW for the whole fan system)

 

Obviously, you will have much more fan energy in a baseline system
calculating fan power with Option 2.  Does anyone have a specific
example they can share of a fan system calculation that was accepted by
USGBC for an EAc1 energy model?

 

Thanks for your help!

Mike

My understanding is option 1. The fan energy in that formula is the sum of all the fan horse power. Search the board, I think there is a previous email from Michael Rosenberg talking about the fan energy. Hope this helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] System Fan Power in Appendix G

Hi All,

I have a specific question about using Appendix G3.1.2.9 to calculate baseline system fan power (I have already searched previous posts and could not find the answer I'm looking for).  So, the Appendix G section reads as follows: System fan electrical power for supply, return, exhaust, and relief (excluding power to fan powered VAV boxes) shall be calculated using the following formulas.  I understand the formulas, which essentially use a fan CFM to determine a brake horsepower BHP, which is then used to calculate the fan power (Watts), but my question is this:  Supposing you have an HVAC system with supply, return, and small exhaust fans (in restrooms, for example) - how do you calculate the power to each fan?

Option 1:  Use your supply fan cfm to calculate a power, say it comes to 10 kW, and use this as your total "system" fan power.  This 10 kW, being your whole system power, is then distributed among all of your system fans however you desire (For example, supply fan power = 5 kW, return fan power = 4 kW, exhaust fan power = 1 kW, for a total of 10 kW for the fan system)

OR

Option 2:  Use each supply, return, and exhaust fan cfm to separately calculate an individual kW for each fan (For example, supply fan power = 10 kW using the supply cfm, return fan power = 9 kW using the return cfm, exhaust fan power = 1 kW using the exhaust cfm, for a total of 20 kW for the whole fan system)

Obviously, you will have much more fan energy in a baseline system calculating fan power with Option 2.  Does anyone have a specific example they can share of a fan system calculation that was accepted by USGBC for an EAc1 energy model?

Thanks for your help!
Mike

Message-ID: <20A5835BADD74A44930B267B051CD5E6FED79D7522@earth-mpls-exc8>

Hello all,

I am working on a  model for a LEED submission.  The location is a very cold climate (northern Minnesota) and thus relies on radiant floor and FTR to handle envelope load heating (with water to water heat pump), with airside heat pump units only functioning to heat air to the space temperature.  Using the proper corrections for a DOAS, outside air, etc., modeling the proposed case has not been a problem.

Appendix G says that I should select system 4 - PSZ-HP as my baseline.  If I want to heat using only the airside system, the cooling design flow is actually less than the heating design flow for exterior zones because of the extremely cold climate.  Should I keep the design heating and cooling flows the same as in the proposed case and just use electric baseboards to make up the envelope heating difference, or should I bump up the airflows to whatever they need to be and let the airside system do all of the heating?

Thanks in advance,

Todd

Option 1 ? the user?s manuals are a bit more clear, and specify that the its
is the supply cfm that should be used to calculate the fan power. This fan
power includes supply, return and exhaust.

Gustav,
 
The temperature for the ground is taken from the weather file. If you edit the weather file, you can input the ground temperature for the nominated days that are in the weather file.
 
And yes, we are using IES here and have found it quite good.

Not strictly true. IES applies outdoor Db temp to ground construction.
The constructio itself is modified to take account of area and  
perimeter.

I think you'll find the following paper useful. Although it does not contain submetered data on VAV boxes, it does contain measured data on 40 buildings that includes

heating water, chilled water, electricity for motor control centers, and electricity for lights and receptacles. Descriptions of the building systems can be found in the

referenced LoanSTAR reports.

Hi friends,

I have just started using design builder which uses the energy plus engine.

I have tried running the simulation for a run period of 1 month and it has
already been 3 hrs ( its still running while I am writing this mail).

Can anyone tell how long it generally takes or am I doing something wrong?

Vishnu,

In general, E+ takes longer time for simulation than the DOE2 based
simulation software. It is hard to tell why it is taking so long without
looking at the model .  You may want to post your question  on DesignBuilder
Support Forum (you can upload your model their and someone will have a look
at it.):

Section G3.1.2.8 says "if return or relief fans are specified in the
proposed design, the baseline design shall also be modeled with fans
serving the same function and sized for the baseline system supply fan
air quantity less then minimum outdoor air, or 90% of the supply fan air
quantity, whichever is larger."

This would lead me to believe that you need to specifically model
return/exhaust/relief fans the same as supply fans and not group
everything together.  Section G3.1.2.9 is written poorly because it
calls out "supply CFM," but should be applicable to all types of fans.

Comments?

Option 1 - the user's manuals are a bit more clear, and specify that the
its is the supply cfm that should be used to calculate the fan power.
This fan power includes supply, return and exhaust.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] System Fan Power in Appendix G

Hi All,
 
I have a specific question about using Appendix G3.1.2.9 to calculate
baseline system fan power (I have already searched previous posts and
could not find the answer I'm looking for).  So, the Appendix G section
reads as follows: System fan electrical power for supply, return,
exhaust, and relief (excluding power to fan powered VAV boxes) shall be
calculated using the following formulas.  I understand the formulas,
which essentially use a fan CFM to determine a brake horsepower BHP,
which is then used to calculate the fan power (Watts), but my question
is this:  Supposing you have an HVAC system with supply, return, and
small exhaust fans (in restrooms, for example) - how do you calculate
the power to each fan?
 
Option 1:  Use your supply fan cfm to calculate a power, say it comes to
10 kW, and use this as your total "system" fan power.  This 10 kW, being
your whole system power, is then distributed among all of your system
fans however you desire (For example, supply fan power = 5 kW, return
fan power = 4 kW, exhaust fan power = 1 kW, for a total of 10 kW for the
fan system)
 
OR
 
Option 2:  Use each supply, return, and exhaust fan cfm to separately
calculate an individual kW for each fan (For example, supply fan power =
10 kW using the supply cfm, return fan power = 9 kW using the return
cfm, exhaust fan power = 1 kW using the exhaust cfm, for a total of 20
kW for the whole fan system)
 
Obviously, you will have much more fan energy in a baseline system
calculating fan power with Option 2.  Does anyone have a specific
example they can share of a fan system calculation that was accepted by
USGBC for an EAc1 energy model?
 
Thanks for your help!
Mike

One quick comment is that eQuest cannot currently model relief air  
fans. This would be a nice feature to add, but for now you would have  
to approximate separately in a spreadsheet, and then add to building  
electric meter as a direct load.

Sam,

Thanks for the response.  So, you are suggesting Option 2 is
appropriate.  Have you had this method accepted by USGBC?  I feel that
Option 1 is more consistent with the intentions of Appendix G, because
every time I use Option 2, I get unreasonably large fan energy savings.
I do agree that the section is written poorly, and the wording can be
interpreted either way, but I wouldn't want to overestimate fan savings
and later have this decision questioned/rejected.  Also, I interpret
section G3.1.2.8 to specify the required cfm of the return and exhaust
fans, not the power to each fan.

Thoughts?

Mike

Mike,
Option 1 does seem to be the correct way to model. However, for a few
lab buildings following this method, the fans used almost twice as much
energy in the proposed model as the baseline, so option 2 was used.
Also, if you bunch all of the fan energy into the supply, would it be
possible to model 24/7 constant volume supply or exhaust (fume hoods or
clean rooms) on the same system?

Message-ID: <96D3EB3475308D48B31E7136AA62D87316651E90@multiorgmbx.cgnetmo.org>

Do any of you know the reasoning behind why the 2006 edition of the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) removed the requirement for insulation for unheated slabs for some climate zones? I have done a few energy models recently with slab insulation as a potential energy saving measure. The numbers were very small, which was expected, but what surprised me was that the savings were negative. Adding insulation to the slab actually increased annual energy usage (very slightly). Cooling was unaffected, but fan energy was slightly higher during the heating season. My quick search for research reports or other insights to explain this came up empty. Do any of you have any thoughts? Are the results so insignificant that the differences I am seeing in the calculations could just be considered "noise"?

Message-ID: <29d33e650901221329j208994fco79dd1c0a3c81e42c@mail.gmail.com>

I am completing an energy model of a building that uses fan coils in the
zones, but are extracting outdoor air from induction units that first
dehumidify and then reheat the air accordingly.  Of the air that passes
through the fan coils 15% of the air comes from the outside air, 85% is
recycled plenum air.  The way that the schedules are set up at the moment,
the Air Handler Units should be running 24 hours at full capacity.  In
addition, the fan coil unit fans are only running 12 hours a day as an
ON/OFF schedule.

Though I believe I have specified all the fan schedules, I am seeing varying
fan power in each month with a spike in fan power in March and April.  I do
not have exhaust fans specified.  Where might this spike in ventilation come
from?

Thanks,
Dave

Keith,
 If you have a cooling dominated application and a relatively cool 
average annual ground temperature, insulating underneath the slab is 
going to disrupt some amount of free cooling that you are getting. 
Adding insulation would drive cooling energy up a bit and heating energy 
down. Depending on the magnitude of the heating and cooling changes, you 
could see a net increase in HVAC energy over the year. An increase in 
heating energy and no change in cooling energy is a bit suspicious. You 
might look into how the software you are using models the ground heat 
transfer. There has been a good bit of work done and recently wrapped up 
under IEA Task 34/45 on evaluating the ground coupling models used by 
various simulation tools.
Kind regards,
 David

The best way I found in learning how to work with CFD module in ESP-r is to open an existing exemplar about CFD and try to make connections between what is written in *.dfd file and the interface of ESP-r.

Good Luck,

Dear Doug,
 

1.	

	I'm not familiar with EnergyPro or EQuest. (EnergyPlus is my
analysis tool.)
2.	

	I AM familiar with Coolerado.
3.	

	The key to a reasonable model, in my opinion, is to get the cooling
performance suitably high (much better than typical indirect evap) and also
the fan HP correct, which tends to be higher than an indirect evap.
4.	

	The Coolerado folk have tested the heck out of their HMX and have
very good equations for it's performance.  You might be able to curve-fit
within your software....
5.	

	Finally, Coolerado is normally a blow-through application and thus
treats fan heat differently than indirect evap.

Good luck!

Hi Douglas,

EnergyPro will model both direct and indirect evaporative cooling.  The
inputs for this can be accessed by editing the properties of the HVAC
equipment, either within the model or by creating a new piece of
equipment in the model library.  There is a tab marked evaporative
cooling that allows you to input various properties.  Don't forget to
set your cooling coil capacity to 0 if you are doing strictly
direct/indirect cooling.

Do any of you know the reasoning behind why the 2006 edition of the
International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) removed the requirement
for insulation for unheated slabs for some climate zones? I have done a
few energy models recently with slab insulation as a potential energy
saving measure. The numbers were very small, which was expected, but
what surprised me was that the savings were negative. Adding insulation
to the slab actually increased annual energy usage (very slightly).
Cooling was unaffected, but fan energy was slightly higher during the
heating season. My quick search for research reports or other insights
to explain this came up empty. Do any of you have any thoughts? Are the
results so insignificant that the differences I am seeing in the
calculations could just be considered "noise"?

I am completing an energy model of a building that uses fan coils in the
zones, but are extracting outdoor air from induction units that first
dehumidify and then reheat the air accordingly.  Of the air that passes
through the fan coils 15% of the air comes from the outside air, 85% is
recycled plenum air.  The way that the schedules are set up at the
moment,
the Air Handler Units should be running 24 hours at full capacity.  In
addition, the fan coil unit fans are only running 12 hours a day as an
ON/OFF schedule.

Though I believe I have specified all the fan schedules, I am seeing
varying
fan power in each month with a spike in fan power in March and April.  I
do
not have exhaust fans specified.  Where might this spike in ventilation
come
from?

Thanks,
Dave

Keith,
 If you have a cooling dominated application and a relatively cool 
average annual ground temperature, insulating underneath the slab is 
going to disrupt some amount of free cooling that you are getting. 
Adding insulation would drive cooling energy up a bit and heating energy

down. Depending on the magnitude of the heating and cooling changes, you

could see a net increase in HVAC energy over the year. An increase in 
heating energy and no change in cooling energy is a bit suspicious. You 
might look into how the software you are using models the ground heat 
transfer. There has been a good bit of work done and recently wrapped up

under IEA Task 34/45 on evaluating the ground coupling models used by 
various simulation tools.
Kind regards,
 David

Hi,

The best way I found in learning how to work with CFD module in ESP-r is
to open an existing exemplar about CFD and try to make connections
between what is written in *.dfd file and the interface of ESP-r.

Good Luck,

Dear Doug,
 

1.	

	I'm not familiar with EnergyPro or EQuest. (EnergyPlus is my
analysis tool.)
2.	

	I AM familiar with Coolerado.
3.	

	The key to a reasonable model, in my opinion, is to get the
cooling
performance suitably high (much better than typical indirect evap) and
also
the fan HP correct, which tends to be higher than an indirect evap.
4.	

	The Coolerado folk have tested the heck out of their HMX and
have
very good equations for it's performance.  You might be able to
curve-fit
within your software....
5.	

	Finally, Coolerado is normally a blow-through application and
thus
treats fan heat differently than indirect evap.

Good luck!

Sam,
 
Option 1 is the correct way to model.  It is painful for a lab building, yes.  Designs are often 50-100% higher in horsepower than what is allowable per Appendix G.  It's very important to help the design team understand this and emphasize the importance of finding ways to reduce the fan bhp.

Mike,
Option 1 does seem to be the correct way to model. However, for a few
lab buildings following this method, the fans used almost twice as much
energy in the proposed model as the baseline, so option 2 was used.
Also, if you bunch all of the fan energy into the supply, would it be
possible to model 24/7 constant volume supply or exhaust (fume hoods or
clean rooms) on the same system?

Sam,

Thanks for the response.  So, you are suggesting Option 2 is
appropriate.  Have you had this method accepted by USGBC?  I feel that
Option 1 is more consistent with the intentions of Appendix G, because
every time I use Option 2, I get unreasonably large fan energy savings.
I do agree that the section is written poorly, and the wording can be
interpreted either way, but I wouldn't want to overestimate fan savings
and later have this decision questioned/rejected.  Also, I interpret
section G3.1.2.8 to specify the required cfm of the return and exhaust
fans, not the power to each fan.

Thoughts?

Mike

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1 Definition of Window-to-Wall-Ratio (WWR) -
	Only Walls to Conditioned Spaces?
Message-ID: <343a1a270901250331p3f4c192claf7617a849ef62d0@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All:

I know a related topic has been discussed here on the list serve before.
However, after reviewing all the correspondence on this topic, and the 90.1
standard itself, I still have a few uncertainties I hope at least one of you
are able to clarify. If not I sincerely value as many of your thoughts as
you can offer so I can understand what the common interpretation is. This
question pertains to the 2004 edition. I don't even understand if using
addendum A can solve this problem for me, so please also inform me if it
does?

In table G3.1.5 it is stated:

"Vertical fenestration areas for new buildings and additions shall equal
that in the proposed design or 40% of gross abovegrade wall area, whichever
is smaller, and shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across
the four orientations."

Addendum A states:

"Vertical fenestration areas for new buildings and additions shall equal
that in the proposed design or 40% of gross above-grade wall area, whichever
is smaller, and shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across
the four orientations and shall be distributed on each face of the building
in the same proportion as on the Proposed Design."

Let us assume there is a building with mostly above grade parking garage and
a few offices that are conditioned. The parking garage has a wall to the
outside, but no windows and is not conditioned. If I am following the
prescriptions above, what do I do of the following two options, or is there
a third option, when following Appendix G?

1 - I take the area of windows in the proposed building and apply them
equally (or not for Addendum A) on all facades in the baseline building, for
all floors in horizontal bands. This way even the parking garage gets
windows in the baseline building, and the offices in the baseline building
has very little window area compared to the proposed (because so much of the
fenestration
 are is on the parking garage in the baseline), so little that this model
significantly penalizes the project for not putting windows in the parking
garage! I here apply the windows to whatever surface I would bump into if I
approached the building by foot (and I can be as tall as the building
itself, so it's not just the lower floors' walls).

2 - I take the area of the windows and only apply them to walls that
separate conditioned space and the outside. This way the parking garage in
the baseline building does not receive any windows. In this instance I can
get savings from placing the glazing strategically within the offices. The
sum of the area in all offices are the same for the baseline and proposed
(since there are only two types of spaces: parking and office).

I have seen in previous correspondence that only below-grade walls to
conditioned spaces are included (I did not understand why only conditioned
but at least I know it's common practice), but is it the case that only
walls between the conditioned spaces and the outside conditions get windows
for above-grade walls too? In the above quotes from the standard and the
addendum, the problem arises with the use of  "orientations" and "face". The
statement that fenestration is supposed to be distributed on the
"orientation" or "face" of the building does not explain much, since neither
of these terms seems to be defined in 3.2 or elsewhere in the standard. If
the texts had used the term "exterior building envelope", I would have been
quite confident in using option 2 above. Since the quotes does not mention
that only parts of the baseline building will receive glazing, I am inclined
to follow option 1 above, although it seems to go against the intention of
standard 90.1and Appendix G.

The terms "orientations" and "face" is substituted by the term "exterior
wall" in the User's Manual on page G-15. This is yet another undefined term.
Initially I was inclined to think that exterior wall is the same as
"Nonresidential Exterior" and/or "Residential Exterior" wall on page G-35 of
the User's Manual which I think might be the same as exterior building
envelope, but this link is not established anywhere. Moreover, on this very
same page, the term "exterior wall" is used to describe an "Unconditioned
Exterior" wall, so clearly the term "exterior wall" is not unique to only
walls separating conditioned spaces from outdoor conditions. In fact, this
use of exterior wall leads me to again consider option 1, above, and apply
windows in the baseline building to the parking garage in the hypothetical
building above.

Closely linked to the discourse above, I do not see why windows in
unconditioned spaces in the proposed building must be included in either
option 1 or 2 above. Let's examine another hypothetical building. This
building is half storage, half office. The offices are conditioned and have
windows. The storage space is unconditioned, and well ventilated so that the
walls between the offices and the storage rooms are treated as exterior
building envelope. However, there are many windows in the storage spaces
too. Disregarding the discourse above of allocating the fenestration area in
the baseline building, I am seeing difficulties in what the fenestration
area is in the first place. If I consult section 3.2 of 90.1 I find:

"fenestration area: total area of the fenestration measured using the rough
opening and including the glazing, sash, and frame. For doors where the
glazed vision area is less than 50% of the door area, the fenestration area
is the glazed vision area. For all other doors, the fenestration area is the
door area. (See door area.)"

Where fenestration is defined as:

"fenestration: all areas (including the frames) in the building envelope
that let in light, including windows, plastic panels, clerestories,
skylights, glass doors that are more than one-half glass, and glass block
walls. (See building envelope and door.) (a) skylight: a fenestration
surface having a slope of less than 60 degrees from the horizontal plane.
Other fenestration, even if mounted on the roof of a building, is considered
vertical fenestration. 8 ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA STANDARD 90.1-2004 (b) vertical
fenestration: all fenestration other than skylights. Trombe wall assemblies,
where glazing is installed within 12 in. of a mass wall, are considered
walls, not fenestration."

Is the fenestration area all the fenestration in the building, both for the
conditioned and for the unconditioned spaces? Or is it only the fenestration
for the conditioned spaces? When I look at option 2 above, if I take all the
fenestration in the proposed building and apply it to only to the
conditioned spaces for the baseline, we can get huge energy savings just
from the type of building, not from the way this type of building was
designed. We can even get more windows than there are walls in the
conditioned offices which in my instance (Trace 700) can cause problems
running the simulation. Even if the software ran with more windows than
walls, the output could potentially be of little value for analysis. It
seems like I am supposed to take the entire fenestration area, both in
conditioned and unconditioned spaces, of a building and this is another
reason I am inclined towards option 1 above. However, option 1 still remains
very unfair when I consider a building with more above grade car park than
offices, as explained above.

Thank you for reading through this. Please post your answers or opinions, if
any. Also remember to reference any section of the 90.1 Standard, its
addenda or its User's Manual if you have any clarifications regarding my
uncertainties pertaining to the various definitions discussed in this email.

Hi;

I have come across a massive source of weather data, mostly for US 
locations.

The primary utility here is in work sorting out existing buildings / 
HVAC systems
by comparison to hourly meter readings.  Monthly utility bills are 
generally  fraught with
detail problems. Our local electricity utility bills cover anywhere from 
28 days to 35 days and
successive years don't always have the same number of billed days for a 
particular month.

The website  http://www.intellicast.com/Default.aspx   has an entry 
window just below  the
Site Banner and top-of-page advertisement.  It is in the middle of the 
webpage left to right.
Type in a city and state ( US ) and click on local weather. Let's say 
you entered Vienna, VA.

The refreshed page has a new horizontal band below the Entry window for 
Local IDs.
labeled 'Current Conditions'  at the bottom left corner of that block 
there is a hot link
labeled 'View Detailed observation for the last 48 hours'  Click it.

The webpage refreshes and shows an hour temperature chart first, then 
Past Cumulatives,
and third Observations reports that give Time, Date, Temp, Dew Pt, RH, 
Pressure, Vis,
Ceiling, Wind Direction, Speed, Gust; and cloud cover.

Most sites have exactly 48 hours of data, but some like Greenville, SC 
currently have hourly
and better data going all the way back to October.

The hourly data can be copied to the Windows Clipboard and pasted into a 
word processor.

For users of building simulation software, or anyone 
interested in learning more about the greenhouse gas emissions associated with a 
building?s operation: we have just released a new, freely available ?Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) Tool for Buildings in California.? The 
tool is meant to help building designers, architects and engineers better 
understand the GHG emissions associated with California buildings? electricity and on-site 
gas consumption. 

The tool is available at: 
http://www.ethree.com/E3_Public_Docs.html

We ask that people downloading 
the tool first register, so that we can gauge interest in the tool, and 
hopefully improve the tool in the future. Your feedback on the tool is much 
appreciated, so please fill out the short survey at the same website, once 
you?ve had a chance to download and check out the tool (it shouldn't take more than 5 minutes). 

More background 
information: 

The tool's estimate of a building's GHG emissions is based 
on the hourly on-site gas consumption of your building, paired with an estimate 
of the building's GHG emissions from electricity consumption. The estimate of 
the GHG emissions from electricity is based on the hourly operation profile of 
your building (which is an input to the tool), paired with a forecast of the 
hourly estimate of the carbon intensity of electricity on the California grid.? 


The tool enables calculation of both a marginal electricity emissions 
rate (to be used for measuring the effects of incremental changes to a building 
design, for example) as well as an average electricity emissions rate (to be 
used for calculating a building's carbon "footprint", for example.) 

This 
tool was developed in 2008 by Energy and Environmental Economics, Inc. (E3) with 
funding from the California Energy Commission's Public Interest Energy Research 
(PIER).
Thanks for your interest,Amber Mahone

Linda ?

 

WINDOW 6 does not calculate the CR (Condensation Resistance) value for a
model with a shading system.

 

The message about the detailed spectral data probably has to do with the
fact that you do not have spectral data for the blind systems that you are
calculating ? certainly the example files that your error messages are
referencing, ie, the Venetian A-45 blinds, do not have spectral data. The
program will still calculate a result using the averaged spectral data input
into the program ? this is not a ?fatal? error, just informative.

I agree with you, Sam. The supply, return and relief fans need to be modeled
separately, which I believe
fits the intent of comparing the efficiencies of the fans between "Proposed"
and "Baseline" and also
informs you where to improve for your "Proposed" design in terms of fan
power consumption.

Section G3.1.2.8 says "if return or relief fans are specified in the

the same function and sized for the baseline system supply fan air quantity
less then minimum outdoor air, or 90% of the supply fan air quantity,

This would lead me to believe that you need to specifically model
return/exhaust/relief fans the same as supply fans and not group everything
together.  Section G3.1.2.9 is written poorly because it calls out "supply

This fan power includes supply, return and exhaust.

Hi All,
 
I have a specific question about using Appendix G3.1.2.9 to calculate
baseline system fan power (I have already searched previous posts and could
not find the answer I'm looking for).  So, the Appendix G section reads as
follows: System fan electrical power for supply, return, exhaust, and relief
(excluding power to fan powered VAV boxes) shall be calculated using the

calculate an individual kW for each fan (For example, supply fan power = 10
kW using the supply cfm, return fan power = 9 kW using the return cfm,

I've been hearing from a number of sources that you can get 2 EaC1 LEED points under NC 2.2 just by modeling a State Code Building against an ASHRAE Appendix G Baseline building.

This has not been the case with any of the LEED simulations I've done with eQuest. Typically a Washington Energy Code 2006 building against an ASHRAE Appendix G building comes in with an energy cost reduction of about 5%, which doesn't achieve 1 point. This is typically with a Design system consisting of WSHPs served by a central condenser water plant with dual condensing boilers and a fluid cooler vs a Baseline system consisting of PSZ DX Cooling, Gas Furnace Heat.

I'm curious what others have experienced in this regards.

I would agree that a Washington State Energy Code Minimum building will
not likely get you a point in NC 2.2 EA Cr 1. I've seen savings in the
5-10% range for office buildings with similar system types and
conventional lighting densities and controls. I believe EA Cr 1
(correctly) encourages more innovation than just a simple HVAC system
selection over another that meets code minimum. You really need an
integrated design approach to achieve EA Cr 1 (envelope upgrades,
lighting upgrades including controls, HVAC upgrades, etc.).

Tim, all,
 
Yes, my experience has shown that the local Washington State Energy Code
is in general better than ASHRAE 90.1.  More specifically, buildings
built under the Seattle Energy Code can typically achieve 10-20% savings
without a lot of additional energy conservation measures.
 
Obviously it depends on the building type and architecture.  The system
you describe would probably do great in a mixed-use high rise with
plenty of diversity and a "reasonable" amount of glass within the 40%
ASHRAE boundary.  The story might be different, however, in a building
with 70% glazing and little or no diversity.  Even so, it seems like
there would have to be some fairly significant energy penalties outside
the mechanical system for WSHPs + Condensing Boilers to be only 5%
better than gas furnaces.

>From my experience the Seattle Energy Code (as opposed to the Washington
State Energy Code) gets you pretty close to the two point requirement for
typical commercial buildings; maybe in the 11-12% savings range. Then if
you tack on a couple of not-too-harsh measures you can get to the
threshold. 

 

It has actually been a little disappointing (from the view point of an
energy-conservation-dork, not of course from a consultant providing a
service to a client) to see that some barely-better-than-code buildings
slide by the minimum efficiency requirements and then call it a day.

George and Sam, 
I may just misunderstand what you are saying, but I suspect you may not
be reaching a correct conclusion. Whether the fans are modeled
separately or together, the baseline fan power allowance covers all the
fans in the system (I divide this among the various fans based on the
proposed system fan power ratios of supply to return, etc).

As Bill Talbert mentioned earlier in this thread, look at Addendum ac to
90.1-2004. Specifically read through the definitions of "fan system bhp"
or "fan system motor nameplate hp" therein which should clarify that the
hp allowance values are for "all fans that are required to operate at
design conditions to supply air from the heating or cooling source to
the conditioned spaces and return it to the source or exhaust it to the
outdoors".

I hope this helps to clarify things. 

Kind Regards,

I agree with you, Sam. The supply, return and relief fans need to be
modeled separately, which I believe fits the intent of comparing the
efficiencies of the fans between "Proposed"
and "Baseline" and also
informs you where to improve for your "Proposed" design in terms of fan
power consumption.

Section G3.1.2.8 says "if return or relief fans are specified in the
proposed design, the baseline design shall also be modeled with fans
serving the same function and sized for the baseline system supply fan
air quantity less then minimum outdoor air, or 90% of the supply fan air
quantity, whichever is larger."

This would lead me to believe that you need to specifically model
return/exhaust/relief fans the same as supply fans and not group
everything together.  Section G3.1.2.9 is written poorly because it
calls out "supply CFM," but should be applicable to all types of fans.

Option 1 - the user's manuals are a bit more clear, and specify that the
its is the supply cfm that should be used to calculate the fan power.
This fan power includes supply, return and exhaust.

Hi All,
 
I have a specific question about using Appendix G3.1.2.9 to calculate
baseline system fan power (I have already searched previous posts and
could not find the answer I'm looking for).  So, the Appendix G section
reads as
follows: System fan electrical power for supply, return, exhaust, and
relief (excluding power to fan powered VAV boxes) shall be calculated
using the following formulas.  I understand the formulas, which
essentially use a fan CFM to determine a brake horsepower BHP, which is
then used to calculate the fan power (Watts), but my question is this:
Supposing you have an HVAC system with supply, return, and small exhaust
fans (in restrooms, for
example) - how do you calculate the power to each fan?
 
Option 1:  Use your supply fan cfm to calculate a power, say it comes to
10 kW, and use this as your total "system" fan power.  This 10 kW, being
your whole system power, is then distributed among all of your system
fans however you desire (For example, supply fan power = 5 kW, return
fan power =
4 kW, exhaust fan power = 1 kW, for a total of 10 kW for the fan system)
 
OR
 
Option 2:  Use each supply, return, and exhaust fan cfm to separately
calculate an individual kW for each fan (For example, supply fan power =
10 kW using the supply cfm, return fan power = 9 kW using the return
cfm, exhaust fan power = 1 kW using the exhaust cfm, for a total of 20
kW for the whole fan system)
 
Obviously, you will have much more fan energy in a baseline system
calculating fan power with Option 2.  Does anyone have a specific
example they can share of a fan system calculation that was accepted by
USGBC for an
EAc1 energy model?
 
Thanks for your help!

Molly,
Thanks for your input. I agree with your interpretation of the code.
Supply fan CFM should be used, with applicable pressure credits, to
determine the entire baseline HVAC system fan brake HP, which is then
split amongst the supply/return/exhaust fans. My interpretation was
trying to get at lab building modeling which in some cases have separate
AHUs for return systems.

Another question to everyone then: How do you deal with labs which have
extremely high fan HP to overcome the large static pressure typical of
this building type?  This has been a topic of conversation before but
would like to know from experience what the calculations have shown.  

My example: a current lab building has several large AHU providing
80,000 CFM each with 200 HP fan motors. The return systems are the same
size, so each AHU has a total of 400 HP of fan power. Following
90.1-2007 and using total static pressure credits of 9.5 in. wc, the
baseline system fan power is only 288 HP.  There is no way to meet code
and overall the proposed building is barely saving any energy over the
baseline building.

George and Sam, 
I may just misunderstand what you are saying, but I suspect you may not
be reaching a correct conclusion. Whether the fans are modeled
separately or together, the baseline fan power allowance covers all the
fans in the system (I divide this among the various fans based on the
proposed system fan power ratios of supply to return, etc).

As Bill Talbert mentioned earlier in this thread, look at Addendum ac to
90.1-2004. Specifically read through the definitions of "fan system bhp"
or "fan system motor nameplate hp" therein which should clarify that the
hp allowance values are for "all fans that are required to operate at
design conditions to supply air from the heating or cooling source to
the conditioned spaces and return it to the source or exhaust it to the
outdoors".

I hope this helps to clarify things.

I agree with you, Sam. The supply, return and relief fans need to be
modeled separately, which I believe fits the intent of comparing the
efficiencies of the fans between "Proposed"
and "Baseline" and also
informs you where to improve for your "Proposed" design in terms of fan
power consumption.

Section G3.1.2.8 says "if return or relief fans are specified in the

serving the same function and sized for the baseline system supply fan
air quantity less then minimum outdoor air, or 90% of the supply fan air

This would lead me to believe that you need to specifically model
return/exhaust/relief fans the same as supply fans and not group
everything together.  Section G3.1.2.9 is written poorly because it

Subject: [Bldg-sim] System Fan Power in Appendix G

Hi All,
 
I have a specific question about using Appendix G3.1.2.9 to calculate
baseline system fan power (I have already searched previous posts and
could not find the answer I'm looking for).  So, the Appendix G section
reads as
follows: System fan electrical power for supply, return, exhaust, and
relief (excluding power to fan powered VAV boxes) shall be calculated
using the following formulas.  I understand the formulas, which
essentially use a fan CFM to determine a brake horsepower BHP, which is
then used to calculate the fan power (Watts), but my question is this:
Supposing you have an HVAC system with supply, return, and small exhaust
fans (in restrooms, for
example) - how do you calculate the power to each fan?
 
Option 1:  Use your supply fan cfm to calculate a power, say it comes to
10 kW, and use this as your total "system" fan power.  This 10 kW, being
your whole system power, is then distributed among all of your system
fans however you desire (For example, supply fan power = 5 kW, return
fan power =
4 kW, exhaust fan power = 1 kW, for a total of 10 kW for the fan system)
 
OR
 
Option 2:  Use each supply, return, and exhaust fan cfm to separately
calculate an individual kW for each fan (For example, supply fan power =
10 kW using the supply cfm, return fan power = 9 kW using the return
cfm, exhaust fan power = 1 kW using the exhaust cfm, for a total of 20
kW for the whole fan system)
 
Obviously, you will have much more fan energy in a baseline system
calculating fan power with Option 2.  Does anyone have a specific
example they can share of a fan system calculation that was accepted by
USGBC for an
EAc1 energy model?
 
Thanks for your help!
Mike

Sam, 
Addendum ac includes an exception for fans exhausting air from fume
hoods (6.5.3.1.1 exception c). A LEED CIR submitted on 6/15/2007, ruled
on 8/13/2007 allows use of the Addendum ac fan power calculation
approach, including the fume hood exemption. Does this help for your
application?

I would submit (without knowing anything about the project, of course)
that `There is no way to meet code' simply isn't true. Perhaps no way to
meet it economically - which rests on the definition of `economical'. 

There are many strategies that can be employed to reduce system pressure
drop, even in demanding lab situations. Duct sizing, control losses
(selection of the pressurization control valves in the supply/exhaust),
coils, filter and system effects, fan efficiencies, duct run
(distributed systems), etc. There is no one silver bullet but a lot of
little things add up quickly.

We often see the same results - as-designed fan power in excess of App G
calculations but when you look into it, it's because the designer uses
the same approaches they've been using for the last ten years. If you
want efficient systems, you have to put more effort into the design, and
probably more money into the construction.  

I'm sure I'll piss off a few designers saying this, but complaining that
you can't meet code is a cop out.

I agree with you, Sam. The supply, return and relief fans need to be
modeled separately, which I believe fits the intent of comparing the
efficiencies of the fans between "Proposed"
and "Baseline" and also
informs you where to improve for your "Proposed" design in terms of fan
power consumption.

Section G3.1.2.8 says "if return or relief fans are specified in the
proposed design, the baseline design shall also be modeled with fans
serving the same function and sized for the baseline system supply fan
air quantity less then minimum outdoor air, or 90% of the supply fan air
quantity, whichever is larger."

This would lead me to believe that you need to specifically model
return/exhaust/relief fans the same as supply fans and not group
everything together.  Section G3.1.2.9 is written poorly because it
calls out "supply CFM," but should be applicable to all types of fans.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] System Fan Power in Appendix G

Hi All,
 
I have a specific question about using Appendix G3.1.2.9 to calculate
baseline system fan power (I have already searched previous posts and
could not find the answer I'm looking for).  So, the Appendix G section
reads as
follows: System fan electrical power for supply, return, exhaust, and
relief (excluding power to fan powered VAV boxes) shall be calculated
using the following formulas.  I understand the formulas, which
essentially use a fan CFM to determine a brake horsepower BHP, which is
then used to calculate the fan power (Watts), but my question is this:
Supposing you have an HVAC system with supply, return, and small exhaust
fans (in restrooms, for
example) - how do you calculate the power to each fan?
 
Option 1:  Use your supply fan cfm to calculate a power, say it comes to
10 kW, and use this as your total "system" fan power.  This 10 kW, being
your whole system power, is then distributed among all of your system
fans however you desire (For example, supply fan power = 5 kW, return
fan power =
4 kW, exhaust fan power = 1 kW, for a total of 10 kW for the fan system)
 
OR
 
Option 2:  Use each supply, return, and exhaust fan cfm to separately
calculate an individual kW for each fan (For example, supply fan power =
10 kW using the supply cfm, return fan power = 9 kW using the return
cfm, exhaust fan power = 1 kW using the exhaust cfm, for a total of 20
kW for the whole fan system)
 
Obviously, you will have much more fan energy in a baseline system
calculating fan power with Option 2.  Does anyone have a specific
example they can share of a fan system calculation that was accepted by
USGBC for an
EAc1 energy model?
 
Thanks for your help!

I would submit (without knowing anything about the project, of course)
that `There is no way to meet code' simply isn't true. Perhaps no way to
meet it economically - which rests on the definition of `economical'. 

There are many strategies that can be employed to reduce system pressure
drop, even in demanding lab situations. Duct sizing, control losses
(selection of the pressurization control valves in the supply/exhaust),
coils, filter and system effects, fan efficiencies, duct run
(distributed systems), etc. There is no one silver bullet but a lot of
little things add up quickly.

We often see the same results - as-designed fan power in excess of App G
calculations but when you look into it, it's because the designer uses
the same approaches they've been using for the last ten years. If you
want efficient systems, you have to put more effort into the design, and
probably more money into the construction.  

I'm sure I'll upset a few designers saying this, but complaining that
you can't meet code is a cop out.

Molly,
Thanks for your input. I agree with your interpretation of the code.
Supply fan CFM should be used, with applicable pressure credits, to
determine the entire baseline HVAC system fan brake HP, which is then
split amongst the supply/return/exhaust fans. My interpretation was
trying to get at lab building modeling which in some cases have separate
AHUs for return systems.

Another question to everyone then: How do you deal with labs which have
extremely high fan HP to overcome the large static pressure typical of
this building type?  This has been a topic of conversation before but
would like to know from experience what the calculations have shown.  

My example: a current lab building has several large AHU providing
80,000 CFM each with 200 HP fan motors. The return systems are the same
size, so each AHU has a total of 400 HP of fan power. Following
90.1-2007 and using total static pressure credits of 9.5 in. wc, the
baseline system fan power is only 288 HP.  There is no way to meet code
and overall the proposed building is barely saving any energy over the
baseline building.

George and Sam, 
I may just misunderstand what you are saying, but I suspect you may not
be reaching a correct conclusion. Whether the fans are modeled
separately or together, the baseline fan power allowance covers all the
fans in the system (I divide this among the various fans based on the
proposed system fan power ratios of supply to return, etc).

As Bill Talbert mentioned earlier in this thread, look at Addendum ac to
90.1-2004. Specifically read through the definitions of "fan system bhp"
or "fan system motor nameplate hp" therein which should clarify that the
hp allowance values are for "all fans that are required to operate at
design conditions to supply air from the heating or cooling source to
the conditioned spaces and return it to the source or exhaust it to the
outdoors".

I hope this helps to clarify things. 

Kind Regards,

This is a very interesting discussion, and I believe I'll agree with Mark.
An overall summary of my position is that I find it interesting that folks
are saying the code is still difficult to meet, because the code (90.1) was
recently significantly overhauled to provide more allowance for lab systems. 

I would say that 400 HP for 80KCFM, or 5 BHP/KCFM is quite a bit of fan
power, either under the older 2004 standard or the newer 2007 standard.

For comparison purposes, in the original ASHRAE 90.1-2004 standard, the base
allowance was 1.2 BHP/KCFM & 1.1 BHP/KCFM for constant volume systems (< 20
KCFM & >= 20 KCFM), and allowances of 1.7 BHP/KCFM and 1.5 BHP/KCFM for
variable volume systems (< 20 KCFM & >= 20 KCFM ).  

Then, you could add to the base BHP/KCFM number with some credits.  However,
some folks noted that the credits were not sufficient to account for real lab
HVAC systems.  Therefore, the folks with the Labs21 program
(www.labs21century.gov) figured out what could be appropriate and published a
draft modeling guideline to modify Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2004
specifically for labs.  This document (ashrae_appg_draft_508.pdf) is
available at www.labs21century.gov/pdf .  This is a great document for energy
modelers to better understand the demanding requirements of laboratory
systems from a fan energy standpoint.  The document basically said, among
other things, that conventional commercial AHU's are designed for ~ 5" of
total static (4" supply, 1" exhaust) while a more realistic value for lab
AHU's is 9.15 inches (5.79" supply, 3.36" exhaust). Appendix A of the
document covers very well the assumptions going into those numbers.  I would
say that based on lab systems we have designed, the 9.15 inches is a
realistic number for establishing a baseline fan power value.

The document from Labs21 recommends an allowance of 2.2 BHP/KCFM & 2.0
BHP/KCFM for constant volume systems ( < 20 KCFM & >= 20 KCFM ), and an
allowance of 3.1 BHP/KCFM and 2.8 BHP/KCFM for variable volume systems ( < 20
KCFM & >= 20 KCFM).

I don't know for sure (since I have no affiliation with the Labs21 program)
but suspect that the Labs21 guideline helped to form the basis for a bunch of
changes that eventually made their way into the 2007 version of the ASHRAE
90.1 standard, regarding the fan power limitation and fan power limitation
pressure drop adjustment.  The fan power limitation calculations in the 2007
version have pretty much been completely overhauled as compared to the 2004
version.  That's a good thing (though I would argue more work needs to be
done for the smaller PSZ systems, more to follow below).

That being said, if you use the 80 KCFM and assume the 9.5 inch total
pressure credit, you get 288 BHP (as Sam mentions) using the new formulas in
table 6.5.3.1.1B of 90.1-2007.  This amounts to 3.6 BHP/KCFM.  Therefore,
what made it into the final 2007 standard seems to be even higher than what
the Labs21 folks recommended in their draft paper.

I guess my overall question, to anybody who read down this far :)  , is
whether people think the new 90.1-2007 fan power limitations are sufficient
to cover labs.  It seems like they should be to me, but would love to get
feedback from any designers out there.

Switching gears a bit, I think where more work needs to be done to the 90.1
standard regarding fan power is the fan power calculation/limitation for the
smaller PSZ-AC & PSZ-HP systems (Appendix G, table G3.1.1A & 1B).  Why is
this important --> because these system types are used for the baseline
buildings in a lot of LEED projects, and the equations used for estimating
the fan power (watts) actually go the other direction and dramatically
overestimate the fan power requirements, which in my opinion which results in
questionable fan energy savings.  This happened with the 90.1-2004 standard
and doesn't appear to be corrected in the 2007 version.  I'll provide an
example, let's say you have a 3 ton unit @ standard conditions, or 400
CFM/ton (of which I happen to have at my house).  The ARI SEER rating
standards would assume 365 watts/1000 CFM, or 438 watts total.  Using the
equations in Appendix G of 90.1-2007 ( 1200 X 0.00094*0.746/0.80), assuming
80% motor efficiency (approximate for small single phase motor), you come up
with 1026 watts, which is very interesting.  Curiosity got the best of me and
so I put my Fluke 39 power meter on the circuit and actually measured the fan
power --> I get approximately 550 watts.  The ARI assumption may be too low,
but the Appendix G assumption seems way too high.  If we are using the
Appendix G fan power values for small systems on our projects, this appears
to show that our projects are saving lots and lots of fan power. But, that's
really not true because all we are doing is comparing our proposed design fan
power to a really bad baseline, one that is greatly exaggerated in the first
place.  That's crazy, and in my opinion diminishes the validity of the
savings calcs because it shows savings on paper, but not real savings.  If
people want to get serious about energy savings, I think we need a baseline
that holds us to a higher standard.  Similar to the lab systems, we need
realistic baseline fan power values for small systems, except heading the
other direction (i.e. decreasing).  If this can be changed, savings will be
more difficult to obtain, but they will be more real and therefore valid.

I've been wanting to bring this up to the 90.1 committee at ASHRAE.  Haven't
found the time yet, but will.

Any thoughts on this topic would be appreciated as well.

Appreciate any additional feedback, and sorry for the really long email.

I would submit (without knowing anything about the project, of course)
that `There is no way to meet code' simply isn't true. Perhaps no way to
meet it economically - which rests on the definition of `economical'. 

There are many strategies that can be employed to reduce system pressure
drop, even in demanding lab situations. Duct sizing, control losses
(selection of the pressurization control valves in the supply/exhaust),
coils, filter and system effects, fan efficiencies, duct run
(distributed systems), etc. There is no one silver bullet but a lot of
little things add up quickly.

We often see the same results - as-designed fan power in excess of App G
calculations but when you look into it, it's because the designer uses
the same approaches they've been using for the last ten years. If you
want efficient systems, you have to put more effort into the design, and
probably more money into the construction.  

I'm sure I'll upset a few designers saying this, but complaining that
you can't meet code is a cop out.

Molly,
Thanks for your input. I agree with your interpretation of the code.
Supply fan CFM should be used, with applicable pressure credits, to
determine the entire baseline HVAC system fan brake HP, which is then
split amongst the supply/return/exhaust fans. My interpretation was
trying to get at lab building modeling which in some cases have separate
AHUs for return systems.

Another question to everyone then: How do you deal with labs which have
extremely high fan HP to overcome the large static pressure typical of
this building type?  This has been a topic of conversation before but
would like to know from experience what the calculations have shown.  

My example: a current lab building has several large AHU providing
80,000 CFM each with 200 HP fan motors. The return systems are the same
size, so each AHU has a total of 400 HP of fan power. Following
90.1-2007 and using total static pressure credits of 9.5 in. wc, the
baseline system fan power is only 288 HP.  There is no way to meet code
and overall the proposed building is barely saving any energy over the
baseline building.

George and Sam, 
I may just misunderstand what you are saying, but I suspect you may not
be reaching a correct conclusion. Whether the fans are modeled
separately or together, the baseline fan power allowance covers all the
fans in the system (I divide this among the various fans based on the
proposed system fan power ratios of supply to return, etc).

As Bill Talbert mentioned earlier in this thread, look at Addendum ac to
90.1-2004. Specifically read through the definitions of "fan system bhp"
or "fan system motor nameplate hp" therein which should clarify that the
hp allowance values are for "all fans that are required to operate at
design conditions to supply air from the heating or cooling source to
the conditioned spaces and return it to the source or exhaust it to the
outdoors".

I hope this helps to clarify things. 

Kind Regards,

I agree with you, Sam. The supply, return and relief fans need to be
modeled separately, which I believe fits the intent of comparing the
efficiencies of the fans between "Proposed"
and "Baseline" and also
informs you where to improve for your "Proposed" design in terms of fan
power consumption.

Section G3.1.2.8 says "if return or relief fans are specified in the
proposed design, the baseline design shall also be modeled with fans
serving the same function and sized for the baseline system supply fan
air quantity less then minimum outdoor air, or 90% of the supply fan air
quantity, whichever is larger."

This would lead me to believe that you need to specifically model
return/exhaust/relief fans the same as supply fans and not group
everything together.  Section G3.1.2.9 is written poorly because it
calls out "supply CFM," but should be applicable to all types of fans.

Option 1 - the user's manuals are a bit more clear, and specify that the

This fan power includes supply, return and exhaust.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] System Fan Power in Appendix G

Hi All,
 
I have a specific question about using Appendix G3.1.2.9 to calculate
baseline system fan power (I have already searched previous posts and
could not find the answer I'm looking for).  So, the Appendix G section
reads as
follows: System fan electrical power for supply, return, exhaust, and
relief (excluding power to fan powered VAV boxes) shall be calculated
using the following formulas.  I understand the formulas, which
essentially use a fan CFM to determine a brake horsepower BHP, which is
then used to calculate the fan power (Watts), but my question is this:
Supposing you have an HVAC system with supply, return, and small exhaust
fans (in restrooms, for
example) - how do you calculate the power to each fan?
 
Option 1:  Use your supply fan cfm to calculate a power, say it comes to
10 kW, and use this as your total "system" fan power.  This 10 kW, being
your whole system power, is then distributed among all of your system
fans however you desire (For example, supply fan power = 5 kW, return
fan power =
4 kW, exhaust fan power = 1 kW, for a total of 10 kW for the fan system)
 
OR
 
Option 2:  Use each supply, return, and exhaust fan cfm to separately
calculate an individual kW for each fan (For example, supply fan power =
10 kW using the supply cfm, return fan power = 9 kW using the return
cfm, exhaust fan power = 1 kW using the exhaust cfm, for a total of 20
kW for the whole fan system)
 
Obviously, you will have much more fan energy in a baseline system
calculating fan power with Option 2.  Does anyone have a specific
example they can share of a fan system calculation that was accepted by
USGBC for an
EAc1 energy model?
 
Thanks for your help!

This is a very interesting discussion, and I believe I'll agree with Mark.
An overall summary of my position is that I find it interesting that folks
are saying the code is still difficult to meet, because the code (90.1) was
recently significantly overhauled to provide more allowance for lab systems. 

I would say that 400 HP for 80KCFM, or 5 BHP/KCFM is quite a bit of fan
power, either under the older 2004 standard or the newer 2007 standard.

For comparison purposes, in the original ASHRAE 90.1-2004 standard, the base
allowance was 1.2 BHP/KCFM & 1.1 BHP/KCFM for constant volume systems (< 20
KCFM & >= 20 KCFM), and allowances of 1.7 BHP/KCFM and 1.5 BHP/KCFM for
variable volume systems (< 20 KCFM & >= 20 KCFM ).  

Then, you could add to the base BHP/KCFM number with some credits.  However,
some folks noted that the credits were not sufficient to account for real lab
HVAC systems.  Therefore, the folks with the Labs21 program
(www.labs21century.gov) figured out what could be appropriate and published a
draft modeling guideline to modify Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2004
specifically for labs.  This document (ashrae_appg_draft_508.pdf) is
available at www.labs21century.gov/pdf .  This is a great document for energy
modelers to better understand the demanding requirements of laboratory
systems from a fan energy standpoint.  The document basically said, among
other things, that conventional commercial AHU's are designed for ~ 5" of
total static (4" supply, 1" exhaust) while a more realistic value for lab
AHU's is 9.15 inches (5.79" supply, 3.36" exhaust). Appendix A of the
document covers very well the assumptions going into those numbers.  I would
say that based on lab systems we have designed, the 9.15 inches is a
realistic number for establishing a baseline fan power value.

The document from Labs21 recommends an allowance of 2.2 BHP/KCFM & 2.0
BHP/KCFM for constant volume systems ( < 20 KCFM & >= 20 KCFM ), and an
allowance of 3.1 BHP/KCFM and 2.8 BHP/KCFM for variable volume systems ( < 20
KCFM & >= 20 KCFM).

I don't know for sure (since I have no affiliation with the Labs21 program)
but suspect that the Labs21 guideline helped to form the basis for a bunch of
changes that eventually made their way into the 2007 version of the ASHRAE
90.1 standard, regarding the fan power limitation and fan power limitation
pressure drop adjustment.  The fan power limitation calculations in the 2007
version have pretty much been completely overhauled as compared to the 2004
version.  That's a good thing (though I would argue more work needs to be
done for the smaller PSZ systems, more to follow below).

That being said, if you use the 80 KCFM and assume the 9.5 inch total
pressure credit, you get 288 BHP (as Sam mentions) using the new formulas in
table 6.5.3.1.1B of 90.1-2007.  This amounts to 3.6 BHP/KCFM.  Therefore,
what made it into the final 2007 standard seems to be even higher than what
the Labs21 folks recommended in their draft paper.

I guess my overall question, to anybody who read down this far :)  , is
whether people think the new 90.1-2007 fan power limitations are sufficient
to cover labs.  It seems like they should be to me, but would love to get
feedback from any designers out there.

Switching gears a bit, I think where more work needs to be done to the 90.1
standard regarding fan power is the fan power calculation/limitation for the
smaller PSZ-AC & PSZ-HP systems (Appendix G, table G3.1.1A & 1B).  Why is
this important --> because these system types are used for the baseline
buildings in a lot of LEED projects, and the equations used for estimating
the fan power (watts) actually go the other direction and dramatically
overestimate the fan power requirements, which in my opinion which results in
questionable fan energy savings.  This happened with the 90.1-2004 standard
and doesn't appear to be corrected in the 2007 version.  I'll provide an
example, let's say you have a 3 ton unit @ standard conditions, or 400
CFM/ton (of which I happen to have at my house).  The ARI SEER rating
standards would assume 365 watts/1000 CFM, or 438 watts total.  Using the
equations in Appendix G of 90.1-2007 ( 1200 X 0.00094*0.746/0.80), assuming
80% motor efficiency (approximate for small single phase motor), you come up
with 1026 watts, which is very interesting.  Curiosity got the best of me and
so I put my Fluke 39 power meter on the circuit and actually measured the fan
power --> I get approximately 550 watts.  The ARI assumption may be too low,
but the Appendix G assumption seems way too high.  If we are using the
Appendix G fan power values for small systems on our projects, this appears
to show that our projects are saving lots and lots of fan power. But, that's
really not true because all we are doing is comparing our proposed design fan
power to a really bad baseline, one that is greatly exaggerated in the first
place.  That's crazy, and in my opinion diminishes the validity of the
savings calcs because it shows savings on paper, but not real savings.  If
people want to get serious about energy savings, I think we need a baseline
that holds us to a higher standard.  Similar to the lab systems, we need
realistic baseline fan power values for small systems, except heading the
other direction (i.e. decreasing).  If this can be changed, savings will be
more difficult to obtain, but they will be more real and therefore valid.

I've been wanting to bring this up to the 90.1 committee at ASHRAE.  Haven't
found the time yet, but will.

Any thoughts on this topic would be appreciated as well.

Appreciate any additional feedback, and sorry for the really long email.

James

Molly,
Thanks for your input. I agree with your interpretation of the code.
Supply fan CFM should be used, with applicable pressure credits, to
determine the entire baseline HVAC system fan brake HP, which is then
split amongst the supply/return/exhaust fans. My interpretation was
trying to get at lab building modeling which in some cases have separate
AHUs for return systems.

Another question to everyone then: How do you deal with labs which have
extremely high fan HP to overcome the large static pressure typical of
this building type?  This has been a topic of conversation before but
would like to know from experience what the calculations have shown.  

My example: a current lab building has several large AHU providing
80,000 CFM each with 200 HP fan motors. The return systems are the same
size, so each AHU has a total of 400 HP of fan power. Following
90.1-2007 and using total static pressure credits of 9.5 in. wc, the
baseline system fan power is only 288 HP.  There is no way to meet code
and overall the proposed building is barely saving any energy over the
baseline building.

George and Sam, 
I may just misunderstand what you are saying, but I suspect you may not
be reaching a correct conclusion. Whether the fans are modeled
separately or together, the baseline fan power allowance covers all the
fans in the system (I divide this among the various fans based on the
proposed system fan power ratios of supply to return, etc).

As Bill Talbert mentioned earlier in this thread, look at Addendum ac to
90.1-2004. Specifically read through the definitions of "fan system bhp"
or "fan system motor nameplate hp" therein which should clarify that the
hp allowance values are for "all fans that are required to operate at
design conditions to supply air from the heating or cooling source to
the conditioned spaces and return it to the source or exhaust it to the
outdoors".

I hope this helps to clarify things.

I agree with you, Sam. The supply, return and relief fans need to be
modeled separately, which I believe fits the intent of comparing the
efficiencies of the fans between "Proposed"
and "Baseline" and also
informs you where to improve for your "Proposed" design in terms of fan

Subject: [Bldg-sim] System Fan Power in Appendix G

Hi All,
 
I have a specific question about using Appendix G3.1.2.9 to calculate
baseline system fan power (I have already searched previous posts and
could not find the answer I'm looking for).  So, the Appendix G section
reads as
follows: System fan electrical power for supply, return, exhaust, and
relief (excluding power to fan powered VAV boxes) shall be calculated
using the following formulas.  I understand the formulas, which
essentially use a fan CFM to determine a brake horsepower BHP, which is
then used to calculate the fan power (Watts), but my question is this:
Supposing you have an HVAC system with supply, return, and small exhaust
fans (in restrooms, for
example) - how do you calculate the power to each fan?
 
Option 1:  Use your supply fan cfm to calculate a power, say it comes to
10 kW, and use this as your total "system" fan power.  This 10 kW, being
your whole system power, is then distributed among all of your system
fans however you desire (For example, supply fan power = 5 kW, return
fan power =
4 kW, exhaust fan power = 1 kW, for a total of 10 kW for the fan system)
 
OR
 
Option 2:  Use each supply, return, and exhaust fan cfm to separately
calculate an individual kW for each fan (For example, supply fan power =
10 kW using the supply cfm, return fan power = 9 kW using the return
cfm, exhaust fan power = 1 kW using the exhaust cfm, for a total of 20
kW for the whole fan system)
 
Obviously, you will have much more fan energy in a baseline system
calculating fan power with Option 2.  Does anyone have a specific
example they can share of a fan system calculation that was accepted by
USGBC for an
EAc1 energy model?
 
Thanks for your help!
Mike

Message-ID: <755C773AFD8A4BFAA54C43B91DB99601@vlynne>

Hello - I'm attempting to import a .dwg file (made in Autocad, and saved to
the 2000 version) and, though the various layers that I want are checked
while in Autocad, only 4 layers are showing up when it arrives in equest.
These layers are windows and doors, but no walls.  So it's not very useful
with just a scattering of disconnected lines.   I've tried several
variations and keep ending up with the same 4 layers, and nothing else.  Has
anyone encountered this before?  (I have successfully imported .dwg on other
projects).

Try binding all the related xrefs to the main CAD file that you are
importing into eQUEST. Save the CAD file to the 2004 version and import it
again. This should fix the problem.

Dear EnergyPlus users,

I have been trying to model an interior residential natatorium using
EnergyPlus. While searching for information within the yahoo EPlus group, I
found some posts referring a paper called "THE HEAT BALANCE OF URBAN
SWIMMING POOLS G, SZEICZ and R. C. MCMONAGLE". I?m writing to ask if someone
as this paper (or any other regarging heat balance and evaporation rate
calculations) and kindly could send the paper file to me (ncostab at gmail.com).
I?ve searched the web but I was not able to find it.


Thanks in advance,

Thank you for everyone's thoughts on the fan power calculations.

I would like to confirm my understanding of the fume hood exemption for
Addendum ac.  It appears that the fan power for exhaust fans serving fume
hoods can be calculated separately from the fan system bhp, is this correct?

In doing so, the fan system bhp (supply fan) calculation must take a
deduction of 1 inch for the fume hoods.

If this is the case the actual fan system bhp would be the sum of the two
separate calculations (supply and exhaust).

Please correct me if I am misunderstanding the intent or application of the
fume hood exemption.

Thanks,
Mickey

Thanks for your input. I agree with your interpretation of the code.
Supply fan CFM should be used, with applicable pressure credits, to
determine the entire baseline HVAC system fan brake HP, which is then
split amongst the supply/return/exhaust fans. My interpretation was

your whole system power, is then distributed among all of your system
fans however you desire (For example, supply fan power = 5 kW, return
fan power =
4 kW, exhaust fan power = 1 kW, for a total of 10 kW for the fan system)
 
OR
 
Option 2:  Use each supply, return, and exhaust fan cfm to separately
calculate an individual kW for each fan (For example, supply fan power =
10 kW using the supply cfm, return fan power = 9 kW using the return
cfm, exhaust fan power = 1 kW using the exhaust cfm, for a total of 20
kW for the whole fan system)
 
Obviously, you will have much more fan energy in a baseline system
calculating fan power with Option 2.  Does anyone have a specific
example they can share of a fan system calculation that was accepted by
USGBC for an
EAc1 energy model?
 
Thanks for your help!
Mike
