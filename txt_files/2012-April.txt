Hello everyone,

I am also trying to model a supermarket in E+. I have also used DesignBuilder (V3) for the geometry and materials.
I have read that I can use E+ for refrigeration packs and cold storage, but how can I connect my DesignBuilder model, with the packs modelled directly in E+?

I am not an expert modeller, but I can use Fortran if needed! :)

Best Regards,
Maria

Dear Robert,
I am now preparing a model of a supermarket in E+ (for the first time :)) and have most of the pieces in place.  So far, so good.
If you have not used E+ previously, you?ll be climbing a steep learning curve for the program itself in addition to using a fair number of the more sophisticated features ? consider carefully whether your schedule and budget allow it!
I use DesignBuilder v2 for the building geometry and materials ? and it works very well. The new version (v3) appears to be very powerful and may allow you to shorten that learning curve dramatically.  I don?t know if they?ve incorporated refrigerated casework?

p.s., Don?t underestimate the time and effort to corral all of the casework energy data.  In my 50,000 sq. ft. store there are over 50 pieces of casework on multiple refrigeration circuits, each of which has a unique COPs. Also, you must identify and quantify casework:

?         fan power

?         lighting power

?         anti-sweat heaters

?         sensible and latent case credits and

?         defrost method, timing and energy source?.

?         and if you are involved with a LEED project, the Proposed system will likely be different than Baseline.

Whew!

I thin k E-plus is your best fit. I don't think E-quest can do it because the minimum indoor temp can not be set below 55F.  I have done something similar before in E-Plus and it worked fine.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Cold Storage

This question has been asked before, but I can't actually find an answer
anywhere.

The question is basically what simulation tool can be used to model cold
storage?

A supermarket is a good example of cold storage.  I have read that
EnergyPlus has numerous features to model supermarkets, including cold
racks and lots more.  But I have also read that EnergyPlus is
text-input-only and a graphical user interface is advisable.

I have never used EnergyPlus.  I have used EnergyPro and E-Quest.

Do any of you EnergyPlus gurus out there recommend EnergyPlus for
supermarkets and further do you recommend a graphical interface?


Your thoughts are appreciated.

Hello,

Does anyone have a feel for a percentage savings going from the 
90.1-2001 to 90.1-2004? For example, if a school building achieved a 38%

I swear I've seen some graphs before showing the progression of 90.1 and
the relative savings between cycles. It is, of course, highly dependent on
your building type and climate.

 

Here are some useful links to DOE reports that will probably help you
(check out the "Determinations" for quantitative comparisons):

http://www.energycodes.gov/analysis/#savingsEstimates 

 

This one specifically compares 90.1-1999 with 90.1-2004 for commercial
buildings, which is the closest I could find to your specific request
(2001 is just 1999 + addenda, isn't it?).

Hi Jill,

I'm resending my reply because it got bounced from the mailing list because
I sent it from my other email by mistake. Sorry for clogging your inbox.

Here's the original:

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) released a report "Analysis of
Energy Saving Impacts of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 for the State of New York" that
compares ASHRAE 90.1-2001 vs 2004. For school buildings in three different
cities in New York they found percent savings in site energy use of around
7%. You can find the report here:
http://www.energycodes.gov/publications/techassist.stm.

 PNNL also did a similar report for some Gulf Coast cities, "Analyis of
Energy Saving Impacts of New Commercial Codes for the Gulf Coast",
comparing ASHRAE 90.1-1975 vs 2001 vs 2004 that can be found at the same
link. They found incremental improvements for school buildings of around
7-10%.

They also recently released a report, "Achieving the 30% Goal: Energy and
Coast Savings Analysis of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2010", looking at nationwide
energy savings for different building types from ASHRAE 2004 vs 2010. That
one can be found here:

Hope this helps,

Hi,

Try De Montfort Uni in Leicester, England. The IESD has a great MSC in
Energy abd Sustainable Building Design. It isn't easy though!

inbox.

 

Here's the original:

 

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) released a report "Analysis
of Energy Saving Impacts of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 for the State of New York"
that compares ASHRAE 90.1-2001 vs 2004. For school buildings in three
different cities in New York they found percent savings in site energy use
of around 7%. You can find the report here:
http://www.energycodes.gov/publications/techassist.stm.

 PNNL also did a similar report for some Gulf Coast cities, "Analyis of
Energy Saving Impacts of New Commercial Codes for the Gulf Coast",
comparing ASHRAE 90.1-1975 vs 2001 vs 2004 that can be found at the same
link. They found incremental improvements for school buildings of around
7-10%.

They also recently released a report, "Achieving the 30% Goal: Energy and
Coast Savings Analysis of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2010", looking at
nationwide energy savings for different building types from ASHRAE 2004 vs
2010. That one can be found here:
http://www.energycodes.gov/publications/research/documents/codes/PNNL-2040

Hope this helps,

I swear I've seen some graphs before showing the progression of 90.1 and
the relative savings between cycles. It is, of course, highly dependent on
your building type and climate.

 

Here are some useful links to DOE reports that will probably help you
(check out the "Determinations" for quantitative comparisons):

http://www.energycodes.gov/analysis/#savingsEstimates 

 

This one specifically compares 90.1-1999 with 90.1-2004 for commercial
buildings, which is the closest I could find to your specific request
(2001 is just 1999 + addenda, isn't it?).

Hello,

Does anyone have a feel for a percentage savings going from the 90.1-2001
to 90.1-2004? For example, if a school building achieved a 38% savings
over the 2004 code, what would the estimated savings range be as compared
to the 2001 code?

Thank you,

Message-ID: <4F858C5A.7000205@transsolar.com>

ENERGY AND CLIMATE CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION ENGINEER

Transsolar is an international climate engineering firm with offices in 
Stuttgart (Germany), Munich, and New York. We are seeking talented, 
highly motivated engineers for our New York office.

Transsolar develops and validate concepts for high quality environments 
that require minimal energy use. To achieve this we work collaboratively 
within the design team from the start of the design process, considering 
each step from the standpoint of fundamental thermodynamics. This 
generates a climate concept in which form, material, and mechanical 
systems are synergistic components of a well-orchestrated climate 
control system; and conversely, an environmental control strategy that 
is integral to the architectural concept.

We use a wide variety of complex computer simulation tools to evaluate 
our concepts, developing unique analytical methods based on a deep 
understanding of engineering physics. We perform dynamic thermal 
simulation using TRNSYS to develop and validate appropriate, reliable 
concepts in relationship to the complex set of factors that is unique to 
each project. Similarly, we perform daylight simulations using RADIANCE 
and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using FLUENT.

Transsolar engineers are often specialized in their work, but all carry 
out a broad range of tasks. Responsibilities for this position include:

-Development of climate and energy concepts in response to local 
climate, site, architectural, and programmatic requirements

-Development, testing and validation of concepts via thermal simulation 
(TRNSYS)

-Engineering analysis via EES, hand calculation, spreadsheet analysis, 
and other engineering analysis tools

-Programming of new simulation and analysis tools in TRNSYS, EES, 
spreadsheets, and with other computational methods

-Internal coordination with other simulation specialists, synthesis, and 
communication of overall analysis results

-Graphical representation of climate concepts and complex engineering 
analysis

-Writing reports and correspondence

-Participation in meetings and design charettes

-Collaboration with German Transsolar offices

-Domestic and international travel to project meetings and sites

Engineers with an emphasis on dynamic thermal simulation are our highest 
priority.Both entry-level positions and positions for 3-5 years 
experience are available.Our New York office is small but growing, 
providing ample opportunity for advancement.


PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS INCLUDE:

-Engineering or applied science education related to building energy 
flows and building science: heat transfer, thermodynamics, fluid 
mechanics, indoor and outdoor human comfort, etc. Ideal is a degree in 
mechanical engineering or applied physics. An M.S. is strongly preferred.

-Experience with computational engineering analysis (text-based input, 
computer programming, scripting such as Perl, spreadsheet analysis and 
macro programming such as VBA)

-Experience with dynamic thermal simulation (energy simulation)

-Proven ability to creatively develop and apply non-traditional climate 
solutions to the indoor environment

-Education/professional experience with current and advanced 
architectural technologies (e.g. building envelope) and mechanical 
systems for building climate control

-Experience with physical testing of engineering systems: system 
construction, instrumentation and measurement, etc.

-Experience collaborating and communicating in the early stages of an 
architectural design process

-Excellent oral and written communication skills

-Computer-based drawing skills (e.g. Corel Draw, Adobe Illustrator, etc)

Applicants with an architectural background will not be considered; an 
engineering- or science-based degree is required for this position.
Interested applicants may submit their resume and cover letter via email 
to nycjobs at transsolar.com

it depends on the CFD code you want to use. The easiest is to check the
website of the selected code, it generally lists the upcoming training
events ...

Dear All,

I am modeling an existing building which has a Water-cooled VRF HVAC system
for LEED. As it?s not yet possible to entirely model such a system in
Energyplus, I am not sure about the best approach to take. Should I model a
Water-cooled Heat pump or is there a better way to represent the system?

 

Has anyone already modeled this system for LEED?  Any tips are very welcome!

 

Thank you all,

Carolina

Message-ID: <1334214636.58970.YahooMailNeo@web192501.mail.sg3.yahoo.com>

Dear all,

We are working on a New construction project for LEED Certification. The project has equipment rooms in around 50% of the spaces. The equipment load in the building is around 450KW. The rest of the spaces is office areas. The building central plant, facade and lighting is better than ASHRAE 90.1 prescriptions. However, the equipment rooms are served by Constant Air volume systems. Going by the requirements of ASHRAE 90.1,if the equipment rooms are modelled with Packaged single zone system, then the unmet hours is very high. Also we are not getting considerable savings also. The tower and pumps energy consumption is very high in proposed case.

The project is not meeting the mandatory requirement of 10% also.

I could dig into a CIR for ASHRAE 90.1 2004 which exempts the equipment rooms from complying to ASHRAE 90.1 requirements. It clearly says that HVAC for equipment rooms can be considered same in base and proposed case. I have attached the relevant CIR for reference.

Can this be used and benefit be taken?

Regards,
Rathnashree

Message-ID: <E37DE647766246CB9B6F4567A1F382D8@MRENG.local>

Hello All,

 

I had a couple questions that I was hoping someone could clear up for me.

 

1)       Boiler and Cooling Tower Set points: The boiler set point states
its range from 32 ?F ? 100 ?F. But the program will not run if the set point
is over 65 ?F. Has   anybody encountered this before? Is this normal or
should I be able to have a higher value? For the cooling tower, is there a
place where I can input the set points?

 

2)       Max Heating COP: In the building tree under the Zone Level and in
the Mechanical Tab I can set the heating COP. It says in the EE4 Help Guide
that I should be able to set this value as high as 10. But the program will
not let me input anything higher than 8. Again, is this normal and has
anyone else experienced this? I am trying to model a hybrid heat pump;
therefore I would like to input the highest COP possible. 

 

Please let me know if anyone can shed some light on the issues I?ve
expressed above. Thank you in advance.

 

Cheers,

2) Yup - 8 is as high as you can go.

1) The boiler setpoint (for a heat pump condenser loop) must be lower than the cooling tower setpoint which is set on the cooling tower tab.

What software are you using, Justin?  I have seen EnergyPro require the 
cooling tower minimum water temperature to be above the boiler 
setpoint.  This might be correct for a water source heat pump system, 
but I don't think it is correct for a hot water reheat system, for 
instance.  I have never been able to get EnergySoft to tell me why this 
limitation exists.

You may have a different situation, but I have seen that error in EnergyPro.

Justin, 

You can modify the HEATING-EIR (reciprocal of COP) in the DOE code for all zones to achieve the high COP's of a hybrid heat pump (so that you aren't using electricity (compressors) energy for heating).

Justin,

Do you have any ideas on how to get around having the cooling tower 
setpoint above the boiler setpoint?  This makes no sense to me with a 
cooling tower cooled condenser  and a boiler heated reheat loop.  They 
aren't even connected!

I agree that the limitation is proper for a heat pump, since you don't 
want the boiler just rejecting heat to the cooling tower, but if the two 
loops are not connected (like a hydronic heating system with a water 
cooled condenser DX system) the limitation doesn't make sense.

Hi Robert, 
What I heard is the DOE2.1 gets unstable and will crash if you have a high temperature setpoint. EnergyPro and EE4 are both DOE2.1 based. That why this limitation exists. 
Also, I believe that the boiler and the cooling tower (in EE4) are on the same loop, and your boiler set point should be set lower than the cooling tower's.

Thank you Robert and everyone else for your replies.

 

Robert, The program that I am using is EE4 and it does seem that the boiler
set point must be below the cooling tower set point.

Hello All,

 

I had a couple questions that I was hoping someone could clear up for me.

 

1)      Boiler and Cooling Tower Set points: The boiler set point states its
range from 32 ?F ? 100 ?F. But the program will not run if the set point is
over 65 ?F. Has   anybody encountered this before? Is this normal or should
I be able to have a higher value? For the cooling tower, is there a place
where I can input the set points?

 

2)      Max Heating COP: In the building tree under the Zone Level and in
the Mechanical Tab I can set the heating COP. It says in the EE4 Help Guide
that I should be able to set this value as high as 10. But the program will
not let me input anything higher than 8. Again, is this normal and has
anyone else experienced this? I am trying to model a hybrid heat pump;
therefore I would like to input the highest COP possible. 

 

Please let me know if anyone can shed some light on the issues I?ve
expressed above. Thank you in advance.

Yes, Hayssam, I have been told the same thing, that the boiler and the 
cooling tower are in the same loop in DOE 2.1.  I don't know enough of 
the code, but whoever wrote it had never heard of hot water reheat with 
a water cooled condenser!

It seems like for that part of DOE 2.1, they only considered water 
source heat pumps and ignored VAV reheat systems.  Or maybe they figured 
that all systems with hot water reheat would be air cooled condensers, 
but that isn't true.

Dear All,

I am working on a warehouse project. Warehouse areas are non conditioned and these areas have exhaust fans. Please let me know how to model these fans. Can i just treat it as an miscellaneous equipment load? Is it required to model with fan air volume, bhp etc.

EnergyPro seems to be very happy with an unconditioned zone having an 
exhaust fan.  On the other hand, you could call it conditioned and give 
it zero heating and cooling, I suppose.  I tried the unconditioned zone 
with an exhaust fan, no problem.  Didn't try the other.

EP is DOE 2.1 based, I believe, so if your software is similar, well, 
give it a try!

Rathna,

In the DOE-2 family of simulations, ?Exhaust fans? are typically modeled in one of two ways. One of the methods ?models? the exhaust air (i.e., the heat gain shows up in the calculation), the other method does not. Both methods account for the electricity use of the fan.

The first way is where the ?exhaust? is part of the system return air flow from a zone(s), with a certain portion of the air volume being exhausted in the systems exhaust and  replaced with new incoming air. If a pressure drop is specified for the return fan, then there is heat gain across the fan that impacts all return air flow. If no return fan is specified, then there is no heat gain and there is no electricity use associated with the fan.

If the exhaust is a zonal exhaust, then only the electricity use get recorded as any heat gain to the exhaust stream goes outside. However, since the DOE-2 family of simulations (i.e., DOE2.2 and DOE2.1e) balances the air flow into/out of a zone, there is an equal amount of air flow into the building to make up for the zonal exhaust. If both system exhaust and zone exhaust are specified, then the two add together.

If you want to see the actual equations for such models, the quickest way to see these is with the spreadsheets that come with ASHRAE RP865 project (i.e., contact Mike Vaughn), or you can download them from the ESL web site.

I had similar project earlier. In my energy model, I considered warehouse
power as miscellaneous equipment load and USGBC has no problem accepting it.

In future if you got project as warehouse conditioned, then definitely you
should model as exhaust fans.

Thanks for letting me know about the problems of installing and running the APEC-HCCV program.  I added a folder HCCV.zip? containing the executable program HCCV.EXE. http://bepan.info/hvac-prog/x1-apec-hccv-loads . Let me know if it works.  
It runs in Windows 7 32-bit computer or earlier hardware, but it will not run on a 64-bit computer. You have to install Windows XP Virtuual Mode on 64-bit.

8760 hourly inside zone wall surface temp and MRT at a point in space is not very useful. It might be useful in Loads program based on design day conditions in summer and winter.  See http://bepan.info/engg-calcs - 3a - Design-Weather-Generator
DOE2.1E uses the Transfer Function method to calculate envelope heat transfer.  I think Trane-TRACE and Carrier-HAP use the same method.  The CLTD-SCL-CLF method is still very useful for teaching envelope heat transfer.  See http://bepan.info/class-notes/e4-project-loads The Total Equivalent Temperature Difference (TETD) method is also useful for teaching.  See - http://bepan.info/hvac-prog/x1-apec-hccv-loads  It is difficult to explain the heat storage capacity and time lag concepts of the envelope with the other methods although all Loads calculations are done by computer today.
The APEC (Automated Procedure for Engineering Consultants) HCC-V Loads program can be downloaded and used.  If you don?t know what the ?decrement factor? is, use 0.5 since the range is between 0 and 1.  An estimate for ?time-lag? depends on the type of bldg.  In design loads calculation for commercial buildings it is important NOT to underestimate the loads.
The hourly Fortran Variable report of the DOE2 based programs include outside wall surface temp.  In the DOE2 Loads section choose (1) Variable-Type = u-name of EXTERIOR-WALL (2) Variable List Number 5 Q Heat transfer from wall to the zone un-weighted (Btu/hr) (3) Variable List Number 6 T Outside surface temperature (Rankine).  Transfer the values of Q and T to an Excel spreadsheet and calculate the inside wall surface temps.  
Examples of calculating inside surface temp using outside surface temp.

I have found the hourly Fortran Variable report by the DOE2 program very helpful. Transfer the hourly data to an Excel spreadsheet and do the rest yourself.

Alex you are correct, eQuest does not know the surface temperatures required to calculate the Mean Radiant Temperature. eQuest /DOE2 uses the Cooling Load Temperature Difference (CLTD) method to arrive at heat loads in a space. This approach makes approximations of the radiant component of heat transfer and does not directly calculate radiant gains or losses. Because of this, any DOE2 based software at best can predict air temperature and moisture needed for a PMV calc.

EnergyPlus or IES are the only engines that can produce hourly surface temp information and therefore, mean radiant temperature averages.

If you are interested in providing comfort feedback of envelope changes and not HVAC changes, learning EnergyPlus using OpenStudio from NREL is well worth the time and effort. Their workflow takes some practice to adopt but once you get the hang of things, creating buildings is very easy. Their youtube channel is best for explaining this, search for OpenStudio and NREL.

Subject: Re: [Equest-users] Can you use eQuest for PMV calculations?

I'll second the suggestion to purchase the Thermal Comfort tool. It is easy to use. I believe that a newer version was recently released - we're still using the 1994 version.

However, I'm not sure that it solves Jason's problem - it still requires a user-entered Mean Radiant Temperature which I don't believe eQUEST gives as an output.

When we use the tool (specifically for perimeter comfort analysis understanding the impact of different glazing options on comfort) we make some assumptions on wall/floor/ceiling temps, some calculations on glass-temperatures, and some further assumptions on the ratio of glass-to-other surfaces from the occupant's perspective. Based on that we can calculate the PMV for that single point time with those conditions.

I've used software in the past that was able to calculate PMV for every hour of the year (so every hour it would combine air temp, a calculated MRT based on surface temps, humidity, etc) and then give an output for how comfortable the space was throughout the year (with hourly outputs of PMV for different spaces).  I don't believe that eQUEST gives the necessary information (surface temps) to do this type of analysis.

I included Jeremiah's response below which suggests that Energy Plus can do these calculations. This was my impression, however I have never used E+ to do them.

Kind regards,
Alex

Alex, ASHRAE sells a Thermal Comfort program which will do these calculations for you based on temperature, humidity, air speed, etc. It doesn't cost much and is easy to use. Check the ASHRAE website for things to purchase.

Hi Jason,

I'm under the impression that eQUEST can't output surface temperatures which are needed to calculate PMV values.

I think an EnergyPlus based program might be a better place to look. I would ask on the Bldg-Sim list for recommendations as it has a broader user-base (this list is eQUEST specific).

Good luck,
Alex

Is it possible to use an eQuest model to do thermal comfort PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) calculations per ASHRAE 55/RP884?

If not are there any recommendations?

Peter,

CIBSE Guide F Efficiency, Section 20 Table 20.1 provides energy benchmark
data in kWhr/m2.yr (good practice & typical practice) for public buildings
including museums and art galleries in the UK. Unfortunately it does not
break down the energy use any further than total electrical and fossil-fuel
usage but this might be a good starting point.

Regards,
Chris

Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E8009E8FB@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues,

It is our pleasure to announce the release of DIVA-for-Rhino 2.0, a daylighting and energy modeling plug-in for Rhinoceros based on Radiance/Daysim and EnergyPlus.  We began working on the tool about 2 years ago while we were at Harvard's Graduate School of Design. Following our departure/graduation from Harvard we formed a company called Solemma with exclusive rights from Harvard to distribute and further develop DIVA.  DIVA 2.0 is the commercial version of DIVA and includes key new features such as: annual glare maps, dynamic shading and electric lighting modules, a thermal load calculation module based on EnergyPlus version 7.0.0 and graphical simulation reports, as well as LEED and CHPS simulations. We have further updated our DIVA-for-Grasshopper components, which can now launch parametric daylighting simulations without having to be 'primed' by the toolbar. Details of the new features follow below. We hope that some of you will enjoy using DIVA, and that you will join us in exchanging ideas, projects and thoughts on our new website: www.diva4rhino.com<http://www.diva4rhino.com>.

Happy Simulations,

Christoph Reinhart, Alstan Jakubiec, Jeff Niemasz, Jonnie Sargent and Kera Lagios


Annual glare maps
This feature uses the gen_dgp_profile program written by Jan Wienold that comes with Daysim. It generates an annual glare map that predicts for all view points in a scene the hours in the year when glare is disturbing or intolerable. The results are displayed as an html report with embedded images. Please note, if annual dgp profiles have been calculated, they are used in the climate based metric calculations if a dynamic shading system has been specified. more>><http://diva4rhino.com/user-guide/simulation-types/annual-glare>

Dynamic Shading Module
The module allows users to specify up to two independently controlled dynamic shading systems. A shading system may be mechanical (venetian blinds) or switchable (electrochromics). Various manual or automated control options are available. When a dynamic shading system has been specified, it is considered during an annual climate based metric calculation and the status of the shading system over the year is displayed in an html report with embedded images. more>><http://diva4rhino.com/user-guide/rhino/advanced-shading>

Electric Lighting Module
The module allows uses to specify up to ten electric lighting zones in a scene. Any lighting zone may be manually or automatically controlled. The electric lighting calculation is fully integrated with the shading calculation and resulting hourly load profiles for electric lighting can be linked to EnergyPlus or other thermal simulation programs. more>><http://diva4rhino.com/user-guide/rhino/lighting-controls>

Thermal Load Calculation
The thermal load calculation allow users to set up a single thermal zone in Rhino and specify some basic thermal construction properties and usage patterns. The occupancy, lighting and shading schedules are taken from the daylighting module. Simulation results  are displayed in an html report with embedded images. more>><http://diva4rhino.com/user-guide/simulation-types/thermal-analysis>

Grasshopper Improvements
The daylighting analysis component has been overhauled to give users parametric control over project location and simulation type and settings.  This means you don't need to 'prime' the components with a toolbar run every time you want to initiate or change your analysis. The thermal components have also been updated with several bug fixes since the last release.

Message-ID: <2C3CF455489D6B4F95AFAB84847FA41301BD2E01B7F3@E2K7-MS2.ds.strath.ac.uk>

This message is to the simulation community....

In case you did not notice that there is an air flow network design workshop in
Halafax next week there is still time to sign up.  As with many things in ESP-r
working with a mentor in the planning and implementation phases can be an
efficient way of embedding new skills.  If you really think about it, air movement
is an important influence in the majority of simulation projects so use this opportunity
to embed well designed flow networks and controls into your models.

Go on to the eSim 2012 site and look in the workshops for more information. I
look forward to seeing you at eSim!

Regards, Jon Hand, ESRU Glasgow Scotland.

Below is the announcement on the eSim site.....

ESP-r Air Flow Network workshop (morning)

Air moves around in buildings - sometimes because we force it and sometimes because we want to encourage natural ventilation. Air is continually moving  because of temperature differences and pressure differences and the imperfect nature of architectural and environmental systems details. Although CFD has taken much of the spotlight in recent years, the ability to assess patterns of bulk air movement over tens of thousands of time-steps with very little computational overhead has a place in many research and design projects. 

As we attempt to design buildings which restrict heat flows through facades even small movements of air begin to play an important role in building performance. Air movement is also tightly coupled to other thermal solution domains and ESP-r has offered very efficient facilities to solve air flow networks simultaneously with the zone and environmental system, transient CFD and electrical power solvers for a number of years. Typical uses are to assess variations in infiltration due to weather variations, assessing mixing between perimeter and core zones, evaluating window opening strategies, CO2 levels and to risk over time.

Designing flow networks is an art as well as a science. This half-day workshop will provide an overview of ESP-r flow network facilities, component types as well as models which demonstrate its use in natural and hybrid ventilation studies and research projects. We will plan and implement a network, impose control on it and look at the resulting flow patterns over time.

The schedule is as follows:

    08:00-08:45 Introduction and tour of models
    08:45-09:15 Planning flow networks
    09:15-09:45 Exercise to implement a flow network
    09:45-10:00 Break
    10:00-10:30 Overview of flow components
    10:30-11:00 Exercise flow components
    11:00-11:30 Exercise flow patterns
    11:30-12:00 Closing and detailed questions

	humidity control
Message-ID: <054a01cd2223$efdb9f80$cf92de80$@buildingperformanceteam.com>

Dear Forums,

A recent discussion with a colleague has made me question my understanding
of the proper way to model an HVAC system when humidity control is a project
criteria.  Imagine a building in South Florida that requires the space
humidity not to exceed 55% RH. 

1.       The building might use Baseline system #4 (heat pump with electric
supplemental heating).  I have modeled that in the past simply as a normal
heat pump with sub-cool + electric reheat for humidity control.

2.       Another possibility is a System #5 or #6 (VAV fan with VAV or PFP
boxes and reheat). 

 

The question is this:

90.1 has restrictions on the amount  of air that may be reheated (It's the
greater of 0.4 cfm / sq.ft. or 30% of the peak airflow rate plus a few other
items). These are noted in Section 6.5.

Appendix G, however, does not reference the requirements of Section 6.5
anywhere (that I can see).  Do they apply to a Baseline energy model?

 

Thanks for your input!

Hi Jim!  Two separate thoughts:


1.       My position is that for Appendix G baselines, mandatory provisions (#.4) are a given, as spelled out in the first Appendix G passages.  Prescriptive requirements (#.5) do not apply except where specifically called out, such as with the envelope tables for determining baseline constructions.

2.       It seems to me a clearer Appendix G mandate that the baseline's thermostat/humidity setpoints must match the proposed design.

Without cracking open my copy to find citations, my strong hunch is that any reviewer who does note "excessive reheat quantities" could be refuted on both above points, emphasizing (and finding citations for) the second.

A related/potentially helpful thought outside the framework of Appendix G:  I think there are exceptions permitting dehumidification reheat in 90.1...  I roughly recall this coming up once and finding it a non-issue through some exception/passage...

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1-2007 modeling for a Baseline system with humidity control

Dear Forums,
A recent discussion with a colleague has made me question my understanding of the proper way to model an HVAC system when humidity control is a project criteria.  Imagine a building in South Florida that requires the space humidity not to exceed 55% RH.

1.       The building might use Baseline system #4 (heat pump with electric supplemental heating).  I have modeled that in the past simply as a normal heat pump with sub-cool + electric reheat for humidity control.

2.       Another possibility is a System #5 or #6 (VAV fan with VAV or PFP boxes and reheat).

The question is this:
90.1 has restrictions on the amount  of air that may be reheated (It's the greater of 0.4 cfm / sq.ft. or 30% of the peak airflow rate plus a few other items). These are noted in Section 6.5.
Appendix G, however, does not reference the requirements of Section 6.5 anywhere (that I can see).  Do they apply to a Baseline energy model?

Thanks for your input!

Message-ID: <1335340195.90538.YahooMailNeo@web192501.mail.sg3.yahoo.com>

Dear All,

In one of the project, the toilets, pantry is indirectly conditioned through transfer of air from adjacent air conditioned open office area. The Baseline case is packaged single zone system. As per ASHRAE 90.1, toilet and pantry has to be considered air conditioned since it is indirectly conditioned. My question is, do we have to assign packaged single zone system separately for each indirectly conditioned Zone also. i.e. one system for toilet, one system for pantry. Can we assign one packaged single zone for office areas, pantry, toilet and stairs together?.

Also, how to tackle unmet hours in indirectly conditioned spaces?

In general, how to model indirectly conditioned spaces where baseline case is packaged single zone system.

Any suggestions will be highly appreciated.

Regards,
Rathnashree

Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E800A3D9A@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues,

Some of you and/or your associates might be interested in a three day program on 'Daylighting Buildings' that we will once again be offering on June 20-22, 2012 through Harvard's Executive Education Program. Course participants will acquire a range of daylighting design analysis techniques ranging from rules of thumb to state-of-the-art computer simulations and high dynamic range photography for glare analysis. The main simulation programs used will be Rhino combined with our DIVA 2.0 plug-in<http://diva4rhino.com/> that exports Rhino scenes into Radiance, Daysim, Evalglare and EnergyPlus. Simulation outputs include:


-          Daylight factor and indoor illuminance distributions for LEED IEQ Credit 8.1 Compliance (Radiance) more>><http://diva4rhino.com/user-guide/simulation-types/LEED-IEQ>

-          Annual radiation maps for urban studies (Radiance/GenCumulativeSky) more>><diva4rhino.com/user-guide/simulation-types/radiation-maps>

-          Climate-based metrics including daylight autonomy and useful daylight illuminance (Radiance/Daysim) more>><http://diva4rhino.com/user-guide/simulation-types/climate-based>

-          Physically based scene visualizations (Radiance) more>><http://diva4rhino.com/user-guide/simulation-types/visualizations>

-          Point in time glare analysis under selected sky conditions (Radiance/Evalglare) more>><http://diva4rhino.com/user-guide/simulation-types/point-in-time-glare>

-          Annual glare maps (Daysim/Evalglare) more>><http://diva4rhino.com/user-guide/simulation-types/annual-glare>

-          Thermal loads calculations (EnergyPlus and Radiance/Daysim) more>><http://diva4rhino.com/user-guide/simulation-types/thermal-analysis>

-          Electric lighting  load profiles for manual and automatic control systems (Daysim) more>><http://diva4rhino.com/user-guide/rhino/lighting-controls>

-          Dynamics shading system analysis for venetian blinds and electrochromics systems (Daysim) more>><http://diva4rhino.com/user-guide/rhino/advanced-shading>


The physical assumptions underlying these simulation programs and performance metrics will be discussed in detail. The first two days will consist of formal instructions, in-class discussions, hands-on software tutorials, and exercises. Day two will start with a lecture on circadian effects of light by Professor Stephen Lockley form the Harvard Medical School. Participants will be given the opportunity to calibrate their personal digital cameras to take HDR images and learn several ways of how to quantitatively evaluate these images. During the last day, participants will be given the opportunity to apply the newly acquired analysis techniques to ongoing projects of their own and to go over specific problems or simulation challenges with the instructor.

You can sign up for the program at http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/programs/daylighting-buildings-0. Please direct any content-related questions to me. Administrational/logistics questions can be answered by Ms. Margaret Moore De Chicojay (margaret_moore_dechicojay at harvard.edu<mailto:margaret_moore_dechicojay at harvard.edu>).

We are looking forward to welcoming some of you to Cambridge this July.

Warm regards,

Christoph Reinhart, Alstan Jakubiec and Steve Lockley

Anyone have experience modeling a greenhouse "climate battery"?

Did you use IES, DB/E+ or none of the above?

More information about the strategy --
Hot air from the top half of the greenhouse volume is stored in a below
grade heat sink using large ducts which extract air using a fan. (image

Arpan,

This is also called a Subterranean Heating and Cooling System (SHCS). It seems difficult to model. Not only would you need to accurately model the solar and envelope loads through the greenhouse, but you would need accurate modeling of the stratification of air temperatures, heat and moisture transfer from the underground piping to the soil, from the soil back to the air, and ideally from the soil to the plants as well.

Regards,
Bill

Arpan,
   We've done a fair bit of greenhouse modeling and earth duct modeling 
(although not combined) using TRNSYS. Bill is quite right that it is a 
complex problem. My hunch would be that you'd need quite long earth 
ducts under the building in order to get useful energy transfer between 
the air and the ground and that you'd lose a great deal of the energy 
along the way. I'd be more inclined to look at an insulated rock-bed 
thermal storage directly underneath the greenhouse slab.
Best,
  David

Message-ID: <6770429BC4498B45B627F96AF8FC047422CA630A76@helene>

Hello All,
I'm trying to model a block of flats for the elderly that have electric storage heaters for individual flats. Does anyone know the radiant fraction to consider for storage heaters in DesignBuilder? Are there any other parameters specifically for storage heaters I should watch out for?

Regards,
Apeksha

Arpan,
I believe this could be modeled in TRNSYS. Maybe call up T.E.S.S. in Madison to see if they already have a TRNSYS module for it, or if not I am sure they could develop it.

Arpan,

This is also called a Subterranean Heating and Cooling System (SHCS). It seems difficult to model. Not only would you need to accurately model the solar and envelope loads through the greenhouse, but you would need accurate modeling of the stratification of air temperatures, heat and moisture transfer from the underground piping to the soil, from the soil back to the air, and ideally from the soil to the plants as well.

Regards,
Bill

Anyone have experience modeling a greenhouse "climate battery"?

Did you use IES, DB/E+ or none of the above?

More information about the strategy --
Hot air from the top half of the greenhouse volume is stored in a below grade heat sink using large ducts which extract air using a fan. (image below)

recent graduates (within 18 months of the date of the conference) of a
degree program in architecture, engineering or a related discipline.
Preference will be given to students enrolled in an American degree
program.
 	* Participants need not be authors of a paper for SimBuild
2012 but priority will be given to those who have a paper accepted.
 	*
The grant needs to be used to pay or offset expenses to attend SimBuild
2012 in Madison. Grants are not transferable.
 	* To obtain the
reimbursement of US$ 300.-, send a copy of your airplane/train/bus
boarding pass or ticket to ops at ibpsa.us [1] together with a letter from
your employer that states that the trip has not already been reimbursed
by your employer.

HOW TO APPLY 

Please prepare a document that
contains the following information: 

 	* A letter stating your request
to the SimBuild 2012 Organizing Committee.
 	* Your name, email address
and affiliation.
 	* State whether an abstract and a paper have been
submitted to SimBuild 2012 and what the admission status is.
 	* If you
have already graduated, state your graduation date and current form of
employment.
 	* Have the letter co-signed by an academic advisor.
 	*
Attach your SimBuild paper or an abstract describing your work and
interests.
 	* Attach a current CV.
 	* Please indicate whether you want
to circulate your CV and abstract/paper to sponsors and potential
employers before the conference.
 	* Email your application as a single
PDF file by May 31st 2012 to ops at ibpsa.us [2].

AWARD PROCESS 

 	*
IBPSA-USA will form a committee that rates the contributions based on
quality, completeness and accuracy of the submission.
 	* There is a
limited number of available scholarships available. Preference will be
given to students who are co-authors of an accepted paper at SimBuild
2012.

KEY DATES 

May 31 2012: Entries need to be sent to ops at ibpsa.us
[3]. This is a firm deadline. 

June 15 2012: Participants will be
informed whether they have been awarded a student scholarship. 

We hope
to see you in Madison.

Arpan,

You could also talk to Equa in Sweden. They have a building modelling 
tool (IDA ICE) and a tunnel modelling tool (IDA Road and Tunnel). They 
both use Equa's general purpose physics solver. The tunnel tool in 
particular can model the temperature field in the earth/ rock 
surrounding the tunnel (as well as network airflow, vehicle movement and 
pollutant transport). It would probably be trivial for the guys at IDA 
to implement some of the tunnel models in ICE to provide you with a 
"climate battery" model.

Message-ID: <CAFjXD03YETtp0JeJ34YsC02yp8__MN6ji=n1iLcf82s4xtk08w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have some engineers that like to perform industrial process chiller
calculations using eQuest. I haven't reviewed the models in a lot of detail
but I believe they use the detailed design mode to input the process loads.
We are calculating energy savings for utility incentive programs. I've
always only used eQuest for building modeling and feel that this is
manipulating the inputs to stretch the intent of the program. I'm concerned
about some inherent components within eQuest that may be causing some
inaccuracies in the outputs.

I'm curious what some folks on this forum may think about this approach.

Thanks,

Spencer

Message-ID: <CALKTE9Q=_xEj2P+-JyNQLj9VhTS5GOc9bW9NgqP3i+mP9W_x_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Simulation community.

This request is somewhat vague so please feel free to respond with any
comments, questions etc...

I am working on my first LEED project, a 72,000 square foot plastics
manufacturing facility and have found the data collection process to be
quite difficult.
The mechanical engineer says she does not think detailed modeling is of
much value, the architect has expressed that he will not do anything that
takes any additional time.

I have created this data collection form, but have not had the best of luck
getting them to fill it out:
https://docs.google.com/a/cleantechanalytics.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGVMRGdPeDN2Zk9JT1gyMXY1QUplMGc6MA#gid=4

Some of the issues I have had are:

   - Difficulty explaining the concept of thermal blocks
   - Difficulty explaining the concept of window to wall ratio
   - Difficulty explaining the concept of a baseline building being
   developed from the proposed, specifically they want me to create the
   baseline first to test their proposed building against.
   - Difficulty explaining the concept of building area vs space by space
   lighting compliance paths.

Other questions I have:

   - I made the mistake of charging a low ($2500) price to get my first
   project, and wonder what something like this should be worth.
   - I am being pressured to produce this model in a very fast time-frame,
   and wonder how long in terms of man hours is reasonable for such a project?
   - I have been asked to use generic data for much of the proposed
   building inputs, and it was said that due to my limited experience that I
   did not understand how to do this where a more experienced modeler would--
   I think that some default values are consistently used in modeling but feel
   that this should be a last resort.


I have purchased all of the ASHRAE books on the subjects, but other
recommended reading would be great, specifically if anyone knows of a very
simple overview of the minimum requirements that I could share with the
project team that would be great..

Lastly, if anyone could let me know if this difficulty in explaining the
required processes, or issues with project teams not understanding the
concepts behind Energy modeling is the norm, and if anyone has any advise
so far as streamlining the data collection process, or explaining the
importance of the requirements I would be appreciative..

Your advise is much appreciated and Best regards-

There are a number of IBPSA BEMbook materials online which can help layout the differences. BuildIngGreen has a good article walking through the energy modeling process you can share. For typical inputs, the 90.1 Users Manual is a good place to start and make sure to note all typical assumptions. The next step is sharing your typical assumptions and scheduling follow up conversations with facilities, users and owners. The initial result review process will be a good forum for having the team focus on how their assumptions compare with typical inputs, and extending that conversation into setting project minimum, targeted and best performance goals which will lead into a conversation about appropriate conservation measures and next steps.

Thanks Arpan,

Going from modeling individual energy efficiency measures or other items
such as solar panels, wind turbines, phase change materials ect to modeling
for LEED compliance is not to much of a stretch for me as I understand the
software which is key, and have a copy of the ASHRAE users manual and other
reference books such as advanced energy modeling for LEED, the ASHRAE
energy modeling guide, ASHRAE 90.1 standard ect-- but gathering the key
inputs, as well as explaining why they are needed has been tough so the
building green article should be helpful. Per your recommendation I am
going to go ahead and model with assumptions, note them and then use the
assumption based model to encourage the project team to provide the
remaining data.


Again thank you and best regards-

Dear Jeremiah,
Please feel easy at your project. I've done several projects that had won the certificate, but I still feel anxious about the project sometimes.
I cannot download your data collection sheet. But from your questions, I feel that you may need to do more work to collect the data. For example, you may need to read the architecture design and HVAC design to determine the thermal block yourself. So as the window-wall ratio and other issues.
What's your time frame? Do you get the project in your company or personally? If it is your company, you could turn to more experienced engineers for help. But I don't think the timeline is a big issue, because you are now report to the owner, which could be updated later and submit to the leedonline.

Hello. 

I attended a course about TRNSYS v.17 and probably
my research group will buy it. Our idea is to use TRNSYS for simulations according
to ASHRAE 90.1 annex G (LEED certification refers to that method).

Can TRNSYS v.17 calculate the internal
illuminance? It would be useful to model lighting control systems, e.g. if the
artificial lighting is switched off when solar lighting provides a determined
level of internal illuminance (lux).

Best Regards

Arpan,

You could also talk to Equa in Sweden. They have a building modelling tool
(IDA ICE) and a tunnel modelling tool (IDA Road and Tunnel). They both use
Equa's general purpose physics solver. The tunnel tool in particular can
model the temperature field in the earth/ rock surrounding the tunnel (as
well as network airflow, vehicle movement and pollutant transport). It would
probably be trivial for the guys at IDA to implement some of the tunnel
models in ICE to provide you with a "climate battery" model.

Anyone have experience modeling a greenhouse "climate battery"?

 

Did you use IES, DB/E+ or none of the above?

 

More information about the strategy --

Hot air from the top half of the greenhouse volume is stored in a below
grade heat sink using large ducts which extract air using a fan. (image

schedules and in the "Edit Yearly Schedule" window I entered the respective
"Ending Day" and "Ending Month" but EE4 seems to always choose the schedule
with the highest number of weekly runtime hours and use it for the whole
year.

 

Has anyone else run into this?  Maybe I'm doing something wrong.

 

Thanks,
Aaron

The "Climate Battery"  Emails I read here last week missed the mark
widely. I will provide a detailed reply in 3 to 4 days, just swamped this
week with projects.

John,

We look forward to your detailed explanation, especially if it involves 
being able to undertake such a complicated analysis outside Trnsys or 
similar.

Best regards

Chris

Aaron,

 

I did run into this issue once or twice and wasn?t able to resolve it.  If
anyone has a clue of what seems to be going on, it would be greatly
appreciated.

Message-ID: <CAAkkLHHDvU9hN3YVaUv+5wswHdwQsbdGPq3Xe+xQx=pAP5EYSA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I am trying to model an air handler in EE4 which has a hot water heating
coil and DX cooling but with a remote water-cooled condenser. Is it
possible to model this system in EE4? Any suggestions on work-arounds?

Thanks,

I have had similar limitations in Energy Pro (DOE2.1 based).  It won't 
let you have a water cooled condenser and hot water reheat without 
making the setpoints wrong.  It seems to think it is a water source heat 
pump system and the boiler and cooling tower are connected, but of 
course they aren't connected in such a system.

Is EE4 DOE2.1 based?  If so, it could be a similar problem.


Good luck!
