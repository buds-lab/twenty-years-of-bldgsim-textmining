A note on eQUEST - the SCE Energy Design Resources web site is a bit
out-of-date for the current eQUEST preview (Jan99 version instead of Apr99
verion.)  I'll suggest they update their posting, but here is where you
can get (with most browsers) the most up-to-date eQUEST freeware:

eQUEST (a preview of the energy quick estimator tool):

Save thefile found at the following link on your hard drive, then double
click on the saved file in the windows explorer to install (6 megabytes)

   ftp://equest:equest at doe2.com/eQUEST_Preview_Setup.EXE

Note that the eUQEST install procedure needs to update
some windows\system files so close ALL other applications
prior to installing eQUEST.  The first full eQUEST freeware
release will happen within the next month.

Six people responded to my question shown below about user 
interfaces for DOE-2.   For DOE-2 all suggested either 
VisualDOE or PowerDOE.  VisualDOE's strengths are easier to 
use, easier to learn and doesn't crash as often but it is 
limited to only a subset of features found in DOE-2.1E.  
PowerDOE's strengths are it use of the newest version of 
DOE-2, its building visualization and its complete coverage 
of all features in DOE-2.2 but it may not be officially 
available yet and like any new software has more bugs.

My decision is (the envelope please) ...   

The input was valuable but I think I will look at both 
demo's again  (see www.eley.com and www.doe2.com) and see 
what I like better.

I hope this does not stretch the policy of this newsgroup:  ASHRAE needs
reviewers for a technical paper 

"Advanced Transient Simulation of a Solar Housing Development in Scotland"

3 weeks turnaround from date of receipt.  I would have volunteered, but am
getting a bit rusty in this field.  Yet if this newsgroup isn't the primary

Please do a good deed and email your coordinates to Mary McGee at ASHRAE HQ:

Thank you in advance!

I'm looking for something that can be used to do on-site surveys of
commmercial and industrial sites.  Some of the features I'm looking for
include:
a) Survey design should incorporate gathering of information about energy
conservation (DSM) measures
b) It must be designed to handle surveys of Industrial equally as well as
Commercial sites.
c) Survey data should be detailed enough to use it for building simulations.
d) Decent report generation capabilites, i.e. something that can be
presented to the customer

There are of course many other desriable features, but these are the main
ones we're looking for.  Any information will be appreciated.  Personal
experience with these packages is preferred.

Thanks all!

I have used both VisualDOE and PowerDOE. VisualDOE is easier to set up a
building fast and crashes less often but only offers a subset of
potential system options. PowerDOE is still somewhat buggy. It crashes
often although I have not lost a lot of data nor had files corrupted. It
uses DOE 2.2 & supposedly can model ANY system that the engine can
handle. PowerDOE does have a nice 3-D model visualization scheme. You
can zoom in and out, inspect walls, choose whether or not roofs and
walls are visible, etc.

Neither of the two seems to be very good at dealing with old BDL files.
What I have done usually is to use VisualDOE to get a model started &
then go to ASCII editing for fine tuning & and expanded set of modeling
options.

Good luck.

User Interfaces, like wine, are subject to personal taste.

Access to all DOE-2 features adds problems.  Of the
one that exist (DOE-Plus, EX-DOE, Visual-DOE, PowerDOE,
and eQUEST) all, like any large software application, have their
problems and/or limitations.  Also, different users applying
the same application to different projects will experience these
problems and/or limitations in varying ways.

Bottom line, try several.

To try PowerDOE anyone can obtain 90 evaluation license for
complete product at no cost (download is free, CD has price.)

Go to http://DOE2.com and follow the links under PowerDOE to the 90 day
evaluation licensing (or you can go directly there with the following link
http://www.DOE2.com/PDLicInf.html )  For a no-expiration license
follow the link http://www.DOE2.com/PDStatus.html and download the
appropriate license and send with correct fee.

Note that neither DOE-2.2 nor PowerDOE support metric input/output,
functions, or parametric-input command yet.  DOE-2.2 will have these
soon, PowerDOE will not have these until late this year (version 2).

You might like to try the HBLC interface to BLAST. 1-800-UIBLAST

I am trying to decide which user interface for DOE-2 to 
purchase.  I usually use a text editor for DOE-2 but have a 
project where a user interface would probably be more 
efficient.  I'm running NT 4.0.  Any recommendations or 
guidance?  I prefer something easy to use but need access

essential to be able to read existing DOE-2 input files.  
Parametrics are important but I will probably use the 
system I have now (custom batch files, spreadsheets and 
customer programs) most of the time.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F199904080941.AA415923MD36789@gard.com>



(We apologize for duplicate cross-postings.)

Dear Colleague,

As you probably know, the US Department of Energy has been working
on a new generation building energy simulation program, EnergyPlus.
EnergyPlus builds on the features and capabilities of both DOE-2 and BLAST.
The EnergyPlus team, US Army CERL, LBNL, and University of Illinois, have
been working for the past two years to create this new program.  In
December 1998, we reached the milestone of a running alpha version
(internal).  We plan to have a beta version running by June 1999.  This
version is primarily for internal testing but we also will make it
available
to people who are interested in developing an user interface or new
calculational modules.

To give those developers who are interested in EnergyPlus an opportunity to
have their detailed questions answered and to make arrangements to get
their fingers into the code, we are holding a one-day workshop in Chicago
on May 7.  The workshop will start at 9 am and end by 5 pm.

To participate in the workshop, you must execute an EnergyPlus Developers
License.  The license gives you access to the code but is not a commercial
use license and you cannot redistribute EnergyPlus code or executables with
this license. Once the commercial use license is available later this year,
you can easily transfer licenses if you wish.  There is a $100 charge for
executing the EnergyPlus Developers License.

You may download a PDF version of the Developers license from the web.
Go to http://gundog.lbl.gov, click on EnergyPlus, click on Developers
License.

More info about EnergyPlus is shown on our web site:
http://www.eren.doe.gov/buildings/energy_tools/energyplus.htm

If you are interested in the workshop, please contact either Dru Crawley
(e-mail: Drury.Crawley at ee.doe.gov), Fred Winkelmann (e-mail:
FCWinkelmann at lbl.gov),
or Linda Lawrie (e-mail: Lawrie at cecer.army.mil).
