MessageThank you everyone for your suggestions. I was able to solve the problem with Mr. Hirsch's help. I will have to try out version 3.51. Sounds like some interesting and useful improvements have been made.

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Modeling 100% OA VAV systems in eQuest (and new EQUEST/DOE-2 versions)


  The problem being asked about arises due to the different uses of the
  alternative methods available in eQUEST freeware (a MS Windows implementation
  of DOE-2.2) to describe both the minimum outside air (OA) damper position
  as well as the minimum flow fraction setting of the VAV boxes in each zone.  

  The min-flow-ratio for a VAVS system (DOE-2 keyword found on the SYSTEM
  properties sheet, fan tab, flow parameters sub tab in the eQUEST details mode
  interface) is the minimum VAV box flow fraction for all boxes supplied by the "parent"
  air handler for the zone; this value can be specified for each individual box or for
  a system and thus "inherited" by all zone boxes supplied by the system. If not given
  a value (min flow fraction control on the mentioned subtab) defaults to the larger of
  the minimum ventilation requirement, the flow required to satisfy the zone peak heating
  load heating, or other available minimum flow specifications (such as cfm/sqft, etc.)
  In dual duct or dual fan dual duct VAV systems the boxes have many more controls
  including separate heat/cool and overall box minimum flow; consult the DOE-2.2
  dictionary (http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol2-Dictionary.pdf) or eQUEST
  online help (although this is less complete and not as up to date) for more detail.

  When the outside air fraction is set to 1 this is interpreted as a minimum ventilation
  requirement and thus is found to be the maximum value of the various defaults for
  the VAV box minimum flow value.  If the minimum cfm fraction is specified (on the
  subtab mentioned above) rather than letting it default, the specified value will be used
  for all ZONE VAV boxes in that SYSTEM.

  For example, on the system properties sheet the fan tab and flow parameters sub tab,
  you can place a value for min flow ratio, and that will become the min flow for all VAV
  boxes on the SV-A report  ...
  the hourly OA fraction will then be governed by the fraction of design vs. hourly values
  choice on the system properties sheet outdoor air tab, outside air and economizer subtab.
  If (on the same properties sheet fans /flow subtab) the min flow cfm/ft2 control is set instead,
  you would still get OA=1 all hours because this is one of the values compared to the ventilation
  to choose the maximum needed minimum box flow setting.  (I know the online help is a bit
  dated and poorly worded ... we are trying to get funding to improve it ... but this information
  is all there, just requires a bit of a careful read.)

  By the way, the SV-A, and other DOE-2 reports are now easily examined: the eQUEST
  version 3.51 freeware pre-release posted on http://DOE2.com/eQUEST/ has a new simulation
  results details viewer that allows viewing of multiple .sim files with direct access to reports through
  an index. This viewer can be used to view .sim results file produced by any version of DOE-2.2
  freeware, but is best used with versions 43 and beyond due to fully uniform report headers (in those
  versions) that the viewer uses to locate reports and error messages within a .sim file.

  Version 3.51 of eQUEST has many other improvements to both the simulation engine and interface
  including: a 5-10 times speed increase of project open and compliance simulation times, an first version
  of a BDL error manager to view an error tree to assist in navigation to and fixing of model errors, and new DOE-2
  simulation features that can be found documented (with other post version 40 additions) in Volume 6
  of the DOE-2.2 documentation at
         http://doe2.com/download/DOE-22/DOE22Vol6-NewFeatures.pdf

  This is a pre-release to allow extensive public comment and review (followed by our fixing issues
  identified) prior to the retirement of older versions; this version has been in wide use for some time
  now (starting with version 3.50) and appears to be close to "ready for prime time."

  Happy simulating ...

    Hello. Whenever I try to model a VAV system with 100% OA in eQuest, I end up with a constant volume system. It seems to be multiplying the Minimum OA Ratio (which I have set at 1.00) by the design air flow, rather than the hourly air flow, even though I have set the Minimum OA Method to "Fraction of Hourly Flow". As far as I know, I have not set any other variables (such as zonal settings) that might override the system settings. Please help. Thanks,

Smita,

I suggest you take a look at the report that Enermodal did on residential 
framing factors. The PIER funded part of the study is at:
http://www.energy.ca.gov/pier/buildings/projects/400-00-002-0.html

This is part of a national level study they did for ASHRAE. There should be 
some data in there on the effect of various types of bracing.

Keir,
I tried to reproduce your error but cannot get eQuest to simulate a VAV
with 100% OA as a constant volume system.  Without seeing your input
file I suggest the following:
 
1. Check the version of eQuest you are using.  I used version 3.44 build
2930 and had no problems.  Version 3.5 is also available but I haven't
spent much time with it yet.
 
2. I assume you have checked the hourly reports to verify the constant
airflow.  If not run hourly reports to verify supply airflow rate and %
OA.
 
3. Check to be sure you're not using a minimum OA schedule.
 
4. Verify that at the zone level you have reset all values for OA
calculations to zero
 
5. If you have manually entered a design CFM, it may not be large enough
to meet the load and as a result the VAV is not modulating.  I suggest
reseting the Design CFM to default and letting eQuest size the air-flow
rate.  Another way to check this is to look at the SS-O reports.  If
zone temp setpoint is not being met you will have a wide distribution of
hours at different temp ranges.  This could happen if you have a large
internal cooling load that isn't very sensitive to fluctuations in
outdoor temperature.  
 
6.  Try changing the minimum outside air ratio to 0.25 or some value
other than 1.0, does the hourly supply air flow change?  It shouldn't
change because supply air flow is dependent on the loads at the zone
level.  
 
Those are some of the things I would try to help understand what is
going on.  It may be that the model is doing what it is supposed to.  
 
I hope this helps.

Hi,

I was looking for some information regarding the amount of metal bracing being used in wood stud wall construction for seismic reasons in California. Wanted to estimate the change in U-values becoz of the addition of steel to the wood construction and its impact on the energy performance. Would appreciate any references to source of such data, ........and in the lack of, any anecdotal evidence of how much steel does typically get added to shear walls.

Thanks a lot,

MessageBelow I have inserted part of the eQuest help screen for the minimum
OA schedule:

Minimum Outside Air Schedule

Specifies the ratio of minimum outside air flow to Supply Air Flow for each
hour.

If the value in the schedule is a fraction, this specifies the minimum
outside air damper position as a ratio of the design supply air flow rate.
In addition, this enables the economizer.

Since the OA damper position is based on the system design flow, this
definition explains why a schedule specifying 1.00 24/7 converts the VAV to
a constant volume system.  I don't know if this would work but if I was you,
I would first try to set the min OA ratio at 1.00 with the min OA method at
"Fraction of Hourly Flow" and eliminate the OA schedule altogether.  Please
let me know what you find.

Thanks and Good Luck,

  I recently encountered this same issue.  I found out if I switched the
system type to a Powered Induction Unit that the model would have variable
flow.  Another place to look at is your thermostat type, some systems
default to either proportional or reverse action which effects how VAV boxes
respond to heating and cooling loads.

MessageHello. Whenever I try to model a VAV system with 100% OA in eQuest, I end up with a constant volume system. It seems to be multiplying the Minimum OA Ratio (which I have set at 1.00) by the design air flow, rather than the hourly air flow, even though I have set the Minimum OA Method to "Fraction of Hourly Flow". As far as I know, I have not set any other variables (such as zonal settings) that might override the system settings. Please help. Thanks,

The purpose of ECBM is allow trade-offs like you describe.  The lighting
may exceed prescriptive requirements (like in your case), but other
building components would need to have better performance to bring the
proposed building into compliance.  You would need to demonstrate
compliance using a building energy simulation program described in
section 11 of ASHRAE 90.1.

	Subject: [BLDG-SIM] ASHRAE 90.1 Energy Cost Budget Method
	
	
	Does anyone have any experience with using ASHRAE 90.1-2001 and
proving compliance through the Energy Cost Budget Method? There's a
statement in Section 11.3.8 that says lighting power in the proposed
design shall be determined in accordance with section 9.3. Section 9.3
gives the prescriptive path for determining lighting power allowance by
both the building area method or the space by space method.
	 
	My question comes in, that for the building I am trying to prove
compliance for, the actual lighting exceeds the lighting allowance,
which for this building is 1.3 w/sf. The actual lighting is on the order
of 2 to 2.25 w/sf. If I prove that the proposed building even with these
higher lighting levels has a lower design energy cost than the budget
building is the proposed building in compliance with ASHRAE 90.1? I take
this to be a trade off, but the wording in section 11.3.8 confuses the
issue. In the User's Manual for ASHRAE 90.1 under documentation
compliance, it says that a written description of those energy features
that either exceed the minimal requirements or that are less than the
requirements must be documented. This shows the plan checker which items
are involved in the trade-offs.

RE: Mac version of EnergyPlus

I got my Mac version of EnergyPlus via Linda Lawrie. I didn't find
the magic location on the web site. 

The Mac version uses an installation process which is Mac-like. It
would appear to genereate the same 'results'. It includes a
script that starts up a terminal window with the correct environment
variables setup for executing runs.

It is somewhat restricted in that it will take an IDF file or macro file
as input. There is no IDF editor and neither is there
a way (yet) to generate DXF output. Occasional access to
a PC is assumed for model creation and QA tasks.

I was using it to test the generation of EnergyPlus models from the ESP-r 
simulation suite (so working in a terminal was sufficient and the audit
and error file streams are fully functional in the Mac version).

It makes for better code when alternative compilers are used.
And why shouldn't practitioners use the tools they need on a 
computing infrastructure that they are confortable with. So lets
keep the pressure up for continued support of simulaton on
Linux and Mac!

1) Does someone know where I can find climatic data related to the Sicilia (Italy)? I need it to use with TRNSYS and ECOTECH.

2) I'm interested to some (italian or english) training course of ESP and TRNSYS near Italy or in London. 

As usual thanks to all for the jewel help.

I figure this is a long shot, but I was wondering whether anyone knows of a
study that determined the typical amount of shading surfaces surrounding a
single family house.  My solar radiation loads are too large for both the
summer and winter and are making my heating and cooling loads different from
RECS energy consumption data.  I determined that probably a typical house
has trees surrounding it.  Before I start determining a realistic scenario,
I just wanted to check whether anyone has looked into this before.

Smita,
Current versionsof eQUEST have PV options thn allow you to plug in manufacturers data for individual panels, and then set them up as an array. I dont think you can run the PV option independant of the building (i.e., you would probably need to build the rest of the building), but if you are just interested in PV, I would go through the wizard with a generic building, and then model the PV array in the detailed interface. I have used the PV option for a couple of projects, and it is fairly simple to model.
 
Hope this helps

Smita,

A software package to consider here is EnergyPlus which now has a various ways of calculating photovoltaic power production using EnergyPlus weather data.  It isn't necessary to model an entire building, so developing input files isn't terribly difficult for PV-only modeling. EnergyPlus is free from www.energyplus.gov and the example file demonstrating PV systems is "GeneratorswithPV.idf"  There are three types of models available including a simple user-defined/constant efficiency, the equivalent one-diode model (originating from TRNSYS), and the newer, David King model from Sandia National Labs.   100+ input data sets are provided for the Sandia model.  The incident solar can be modeled to include the effects of other surfaces that might shade, or reflect onto, the panels.

Dear all,

I'm working on building design as a function of the climate and for a
project, I have to run simulations for the European capitals. Therefore I
need meteorological data for these cities.
Does anybody have an idea of some web ressources for such information ?

Thanks for help.

Smita,
  The Solar Energy Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin - Madison 
developed a freely downloadable PV performance estimating tool based on 
TRNSYS. You can download the tool from http://sel.me.wisc.edu/trnsys 
byfollowing the "Demos" link on the left followed by the "TRNSYS 14.2 demos 
page" link at the very bottom of that page. The PV demo is listed as 
"Building Integrated Photovoltaics" You can get straight to the download 
page by following: http://sel.me.wisc.edu/trnsys/downloads/trnsedapps/demos.htm
Kind regards,
   David

 with DOE-2/BLAST
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200408181852.AA5254406pd80000313744@gard.com>

Two new sets of weather data covering Spain and six countries in
Central America/Caribbean are now available in EnergyPlus format:

Spanish Weather for Energy Calculations (SWEC)
Originally developed for use with Calener, a new program for building
energy labelling in Spain, these weather files cover all 52 Spanish
provincial capitals. Calener was developed by the Grupo de Termotecnia
of the Escuela Superior de Ingeneiros in Seville for the Spanish
Government. The weather files were synthetically generated using
Climed (Portuguese software developed by Ricardo Aguiar) from mean
monthly data coming from the Spanish Meteorological National Institute.
These weather files were converted from the DOE-2 binary to EnergyPlus
format and include constant wind speeds of 6.7 m/s.  Our thanks to
Profesor Luis P?rez-Lombard and the Grupo de Termotecnia of the
Escuela Superior de Ingenieros for sharing these data with the EnergyPlus
community.

New EnergyPlus format Weather Data for Central America and Cuba
We are happy to announce the availability of new EnergyPlus-format weather
data for 37 locations in Central America (Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras, and Nicaragua) and Cuba.  The data are from the Solar and
Wind Energy Resource Assessment (SWERA) project, funded by the United
National Environment Programme, Global Environment Facility. (More
information on SWERA is available on their web site: http://swera.unep.net/
).
Thanks to SWERA for making these data available.

These two new sets bring the total number of weather files available
on the EnergyPlus web site to 665 with more than 280 in the US, 55
in Canada, and 320 around the world.  All the new data are available
on the international weather page of the EnergyPlus web site:
http://www.energyplus.gov/cfm/weatherdata_int.cfm

If you know of other typical weather data that could be shared with
EnergyPlus and ESP-r users, please contact us directly.  We have
another set of 60+ files created for Italy and a few others throughout
the world that we plan to post as soon as time allows.



Comparison of EnergyPlus with DOE-2 and BLAST
A recently published paper compares the capabilities of EnergyPlus
with those of DOE-2.1E and BLAST.  The paper was presented at
the IBPSA-USA SimBuild 2004 conference in early August and is
available here:  http://ceae.colorado.edu/ibpsa/ocs/viewpaper.php?id=75
We recently collected similar information on Energy-10, ESP-r, TRNSYS,
and eQuest, and plan to extend the comparison over the next few months.


Information on EnergyPlus, interfaces under development, and other
resources are available on our web site:  www.energyplus.gov

Subject: [bldg-sim] LEED Modeling question
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200408170751.AA5126140pd80000312038@gard.com>

I have a question for everyone.  I am currently working on an energy
model for a LEED project and the architect has done a good job of
putting low occupancy spaces / corridors along the perimeter of the
building.  I was hoping for some in-sight into how to set up a baseline
model so that I can capture the benefits of the architects floor plan
given that I am not supposed to change schedules or occupant levels.
How appropriate would it be to put occupied zones on the perimeter in
the baseline model and then move them to the interior?  It seems like
the right answer but i'm not sure.
 
Thanks for any help.

Dear Rob
   I very much appreciate your answer as well as those of others on double skin buildings. I understand that you more or less do agree that there is a problem with double skin buildings in climates in which cooling is more important than heating. If someone does not agree with this statement, I would very much appreciate it if he responds.
   I have no problem with understanding that natural ventilation is a good policy - and this can be easily simulated in DOE2.
My problem is when I use double skin buildings with Natural ventilation - in that case the outside velocity is relevant.
   I would like once more to repeat that in many places in teh Mediterranean that during teh 90ies there was an explosion of air conditioning, people insist in having open windows even when the air conditioning functions  (I even watched a fist fight over that but of course this is irrelevant to the list)

  Samuel,

   

  In my part of Australia, we have similar climate patterns. Double skin buildings rarely are built because of energy reasons except in our cooler climates. However, have you tried simulating a mixed mode building? 

  the architect will then have the openable windows and the occupant can choose to close them whenever the climate outside is not favourable.

   

  As a basis of simulation, I would organise the windows to open (and the AC to stop) whenever the external conditions are between 18C and 25C. Organise the windows to close when the average hourly wind speed is above 5m/s or when the RH is approaching 90%. There are also security and acoustic issues with opening windows but hey, life wasn?t meant to be easy.

   

  Our Brisbane climate is perhaps closest to that of Tel Aviv, it is a little more humid perhaps. Our simulations portray 4-5 months of the year can easily operate on natural ventilation mode.

  Subject: [bldg-sim] Double Skin Buildings

   

     I have simulated a double skin building using DOE2.1.E.

     My conclusion for the climate of Israel - in which the summer problems are far more important than the winter ones - was that

  whatever advanrage one has during the winter is balanced by higher energy consumption during the summer period.

     The results of my simulation are very much resented by the architect who asked for it. In particular, he points out to something that cannot be put into simulation codes - that many people in air-conditioned buildings in mediterranean countries resent very much having to stay with closed windows.

     I was wondering if someone has any comments on what i wrinting.    Thanks    S.  Hassid

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200408041232.AA324146pd80000298465@gard.com>

Please participate in the beta test of EP-Quick.  EP-Quick 
is a simple program that creates an EnergyPlus input file.  
You may use EP-Quick to create an input file for a 
building, without HVAC, using simple templates for the 
shape and zone layout. EP-Quick is not a full interface for 
EnergyPlus but simply a way to generate input files 
quickly.
 
The installer may be downloaded from:

  http://www.gard.com/ep-quick/EP-Quick-Setup.exe

To use it, press the "NEW" button and select a template and 
the types of floors. I am planning on having additional 
templates by the time it is released. Once a template is 
selected, zoning and shape are fixed but the overall 
dimension of the building can be changed.  The buildings 
are "prismatic" and are the same shape and size on all 
floors.  Windows and doors may be added and constructions 
and schedules may be modified.   

Use main "tree" interface to examine and modify the many 
different details of the building.  The main parts of the 
tree are:  

+ Overall Geometry - depth, width

+ Building - roof, floor, interior constructions

+ Defaults - default values used in "Floorplans" 

+ Internal Gain Types - lighting, people, schedules

+ Floorplans - zones, exterior walls, windows, etc

+ Corners - locations of the building vertices

+ Roof corners - locations of special roof vertices

Please take a look at the software and the resulting IDF 
files. Your feedback is welcome on: 

  Bugs

  User Interface

  Capabilities

  Price

  Templates desired

The beta test will end and the beta version will stop 
working on September 30 but please send your comments to me 
a soon as possible. 

I'm sending this message to the BLDG-SIM mailing list, the 
EnergyPlus_Support at yahoo.com mailing list, and others so I 
apologize if you receive more than one copy.

Thanks,

Jason
