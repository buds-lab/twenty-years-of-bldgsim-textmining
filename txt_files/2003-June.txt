Subject: [BLDG-SIM] VisualSPARK 2.0 RELEASED
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200306301737.AA371400pd80000342789@gard.com>

VisualSPARK 2.0 RELEASED!

Version 2.0 of the VisualSPARK environment for simulation
of advanced building energy systems has just been released.
For more information on VisualSPARK, a complete list of new features,
or to download the program free of charge, please go to
http://SimulationResearch.lbl.gov > VisualSPARK.

A few of the new features are:

SPARSE LINEAR SOLUTION METHOD
This method reduces calculation time by orders of magnitude on
large simulation problems that have a sparse Jacobian matrix.

MULTI-VALUED INVERSE FUNCTIONS
In SPARK 1 all inverse functions were single-valued, i.e., the
inverse returned only one value. SPARK 2 allows inverse functions to
return two or more values simultaneously.

XML PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
The problem topology is now described by an XML file. This allows
having a compiler- and linker-free SPARK as long as all atomic
classes are compiled and built as dynamic libraries.

IMPROVED SOLUTION METHODS
o Integrated newest release of UMFPACK for the sparse linear solver.
o Added perturbed Newton solution method.
o Added keys in the Preference file for safety factors used in
convergence
  test(for Prediction/Iteration stage and Break/Normal unknown
variables).
o Added a key in the Preference file to specifiy the minimum number
  of iterations when solving the strong components.
o Added variable scale for all problem variables.

NEW RUNTIME CONTROL PARAMETERS
o Added the following keys in the .run file:
- InitialConsistentCalculation to indicate whether or not to calculate
  consistent values at the initial time by solving for the
time-derivatives
  of the dynamic variables using the specified boundary conditions.
- InitialTimeStep to specify the value of the initial time step.
- VariableTimeStep to indicate whether or not to vary the time step
during
  the simulation.
- MinTimeStep to specifiy the smallest allowed time step.
- MaxTimeStep to specifiy the largest allowed time step.

NEW DRIVER API
o Now supports both static and dynamic build operations in the driver
  function.
o The runtime problem loader now supports explicit linking from dynamic
  libraries.

READ URL MECHANISM
This is a generalized way of specifying where and how input values
are obtained at runtime. With this mechanism SPARK can now read;
o EnergyPlus, DOE-2 and TMY weather files
o DOE-2 schedules
o Algebraic expressions
o ASCII formatted files

VARIABLE TIME STEPPING
Added an Euler integration method with variable time step to reduce
calculation time and to control local truncation error.

INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS

o Tree-view of problem showing objects associated with the problem.
o Right-clicking on a project name now pops up a menu with choice
  to edit the problem file or show the tree structure of the problem.
o Right-clicking on a class name pops up a menu from which you may
choose
  to edit the class file or show the tree structure of the class.
o Checkbox to allow variable time step and inputs for mininum and
maximum
  time step.
o Wallclock entries to choose date and time for run (e.g. for reading
  weather file data.
o Comparative plots of related problems: you can show same variables
from
  multiple runs of problems on same graph.
o New tab showing Structure and Defaults:
  - Structure: shows problem structure as a tree; you can browse
inverses,
    parameters, input variables and unknowns.
  - Defaults: shows default values for solution methods, max iterations,
etc.
o Component tab shows component structures as trees, where you can
browse
  unknowns and objects, including their inverses, targets and callbacks.

SPARK was developed by the Simulation Research Group of Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory and by Ayres Sowell Associates, with
support from the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Energy, Office of Building Technology Programs of the U.S.
Department of Energy, program manager Dru Crawley.

Peter,
 
One study that comes to mind quickly is a comparison of results from the
"solar test cells" at Poway, CA
with DOE-2, perhaps in the early 80s. Fred Winkelmann at LBNL can perhaps
provide specifics. These
tests were under controlled circumstances rather than actual building. But,
IMHO, comparisons
with field data from occupied buildings will have so many uncontrolled and
confounding factors as to
be meaningless.
 
Ed Sowell
 

 Can anyone point me to papers that discuss the validation of whole building
energy models (DOE2 or others) with measured building data? I am looking for
papers discussing the accuracy that can be achieved for both simulations
based on comprehensive energy audits of existing buildings and simulations
based on design documents that are then compared to measured performance of
the building after occupation.

LBL-37979     COMPARISON OF DOE-2 WITH MEASUREMENTS IN THE PALA TEST HOUSES 
Abstract: 
The predictions of the DOE-2 program for building energy analysis have been compared with measurements in the Pala test houses near San Diego, California. This work is part of the California Institute for Energy Efficiency's "Alternatives to Compressor Cooling in California Transition Zones" project in which DOE-2 is being used for parametric analysis of cooling strategies that reduce peak electrical power in hot and dry climates. To establish the validity of DOE-2 for this kind of analysis the program was compared with room air temperature measurements in a "low-mass" however with conventional insulated stud wall construction and a "high-mass" house with insulated concrete walls. To test different aspects of the DOE-2 calculation, four different unconditioned thermal configurations of these houses were considered: unshaded windows, shaded windows, white exterior surfaces, and forced night ventilation. In all cases, DOE-2 agreed well with the air temperature measurements, with a mean deviation between simulation and measurement ranging from 0.2 to 1.0K depending on configuration and type of house. Using a development version of DOE-2, comparisons with inside surface temperature measurements were also made. These comparisons showed good agreement.

Validation of simulation predictionsI participated in the calibration of
simulations of commercial buildings as part of the BPA Energy Edge research
project in the early 90's.  The buildings included high-rise office, small
office, fast food, and supermarket.  The models were calibrated to hourly
end-use data and, to a lesser extent HVAC subsystem data.  For example over
200 channels were monitored for the large office building.  Not all of the
channels were used for model calibration, however.

Amongst the published papers that came out of the research were the
following:

Kaplan Engineering and Portland Energy
Conservation, Inc , (1991). "Energy Edge Modelers Guidelines

Report."



Kaplan Engineering and Portland Energy

Conservation, Inc , ?Energy Edge Simulation

Power Administration Commercial Technology Section

Retrospective, Energy Edge Prepared for the Bonneville

Power Administration. Portland, Oregon, December.



Over the Energy Edge: Results from a Seven Year New

Commercial Buildings Research and Demonstration Project

(final report from LBNL)



There were also the calibration ("tuning") reports for the individual
buildings.  An example is

Kaplan Engineering and Portland Energy Conservation, Inc.  (1993).

?Energy Edge: SeaFirst Tower at Bellevue Place Simulation Tuning?,

prepared for Bonneville Power Administration Commercial Technology Section

under cooperative agreement #DE-FC79-85BP26683



In that calibration exercise, the energy use categories calibrated were
total building, total HVAC, total interior lighting, receptacle plugs,
elevators, and parking garage.  Within HVAC, energy for heating, cooling,
AHUs, condenser pumps and cooling tower fans, and chilled water pumps were
individually calibrated.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200306251219.AA1959984pd80000338656@gard.com>

DOE also funded research on thermal mass which showed that thermal mass may have significant effect, minimal effect or adverse effect on cooling/heating  load. In theory, thermal mass in walls is like the balance wheel, which I don?t think will help in reducing the cooling load in the refrigerator  case. combining thermal mass with other factors such as infiltration, mechanical system sizing/operation, etc. may be!.

While this is a slight divergence from the original issue that Mark Case 
brought up, I wanted to address one item in Christian Struck's 
email.  Christian mentions a system of activating a thermal mass using a 
passive nighttime conditioning scheme.  This could have wide applicability, 
and it is partially the subject of a research paper on a "passive" radiant 
ceiling slab system modeled in EnergyPlus that will be presented at the 
upcoming ASHRAE meeting.  So, models for this idea already exist in 
EnergyPlus and probably in other programs as well.  If you have an interest 
in what EnergyPlus can do in this area, please let me know or come to the 
presentation in Kansas City.

On a related note: I have run a number of simulations in DOE-2 and talked
with others about using mass in a structure, with and without the night
flush algorithms capability. With custom weighting factors or not, it seems
very difficult to show any net benefit from mass in the structure. 

Have others found that they can show significant energy benefit in DOE-2
from the use of mass i.e. from delay of cooling loads into unoccupied hours?


Any success with the night flush routines?

Nothing to rectify at all, but a small addendum.
A large thermal mass causes the heat transfer to slow down due to its
thermal resistivity. Nevertheless, if you have constant conditions of either
side of the wall you will still have a steady heat transfer. The temperature
difference between inside and outside (wind not taken into account) governs
the exchange. By comparing a wall with no thermal mass to a wall with large
thermal mass in equilibrium you will find the same rate of heat transferred.
Thermal mass is only beneficial to the internal climate under varying
internal and external conditions due to the storage capacity (time lag) of
the building fabric.

Interestingly that the point, the industry started thinking about,
activating the thermal mass of buildings further by embedding water powered
pipework into the neutral axis of ceiling slabs or walls. That allows coolth
to be stored at night by running i.e. a water to air heat exchanger to be
available for passive conditioning during the summer day. Same principle
applies for heating. 

The principle is dead simple, but its benefits difficult to assess. Here we
go again, its our game, building simulation in order to assess the systems
energetic benefits.

I agree.  I assuming that the refrigerator is inside a larger facility
shaded from the sun.  My understanding of thermal mass leads me to believe
that it will have little effect on this refrigeration process.   Thermal
mass plays a part when the loads change with time.  The thermal mass stores
the heat to be radiated later.  This is obviously advantageous for building
design in hot climates because the instantaneous solar load effect can be
delayed to a time when the conduction load due to temperatures decreases.
Hence reducing the peak sensible load slightly.  In the refrigeration
process, the loads are more or less constant and direct solar would not be
an issue.  

If anyone can elaborate on, or correct my explanation, I would appreciate
it.

Yes, I am with eQuest results and your guts!. DOE also funded research on
thermal mass which showed that thermal mass may have significant effect,
minimal effect or adverse effect on cooling/heating  load. In theory,
thermal mass in walls is like the balance wheel, which I don't think will
help in reducing the cooling load in your case. Other factors such as
infiltration, mechanical system sizing/operation, etc. may be!.

I hate to suggest bringing reality into this, but a
little research into examples provided by the
manufacturer might be in order.  With the owner's
permission, the local utility companies where the
various types of construction have been in operation
should be able to release energy data.

Couple of questions:
 
1. What is the freezer floor? Is it insulated? 
 
2. What are the exterior conditions? Is this freezer in an unconditioned
warehouse?
 
3. Are you using custom weighting factors or pre-calculated weighting

Ok - here's a question, maybe stimulate a little controversy but as many of
you know -  that's the way I like it. 
-10 F freezer, 100,000+ square feet. Reasonably steady product loading 24
hours a day (say 90 tons +/- 25 tons in a given hour).

Two envelope systems: 5" metal skin panel with expanded polyurethane vs.
thermal mass panel of 8" HW concrete interior, 6" extruded polystyrene,
2-1/2  HW concrete exterior.

Polyu conductivity .0142 btu/h-ft-F (LTTR basis). Metal skin wall U without
external skin resistance (DOE2) = ..033. Polystyrene .0167, thermal mass
wall U = .030.  

Question - which one is better? That's a loaded question but from a strictly
thermal performance measure -  kWh per year to cool - is there more
difference than the .030 vs. .033 U-value would imply?.

We are using eQuest (Doe2.2) and it show the thermal mass as `slightly'
better. The manufacturer, based largely on testimonial evidence, insists it
is MUCH better. 

One issue that they raise is infiltration through the metal skin panels and
the impact on in-situ R value. They site ORNL test results that apparently
show this but I've not seen them. I know ORNL did some testing on apparent R
of mass walls but it didn't seem conclusive to me that it would apply in
this situation.

Anyone out there that can cite well documented research about the
differences? Anyone have comments about DOE2's strengths and weaknesses in
capturing the effects of the large wall thermal mass?

Ok - here's a question, maybe stimulate a little controversy but as many
of you know -  that's the way I like it. 
-10 F freezer, 100,000+ square feet. Reasonably steady product loading
24 hours a day (say 90 tons +/- 25 tons in a given hour).
Two envelope systems: 5" metal skin panel with expanded polyurethane vs.
thermal mass panel of 8" HW concrete interior, 6" extruded polystyrene,
2-1/2  HW concrete exterior.
Polyu conductivity .0142 btu/h-ft-F (LTTR basis). Metal skin wall U
without external skin resistance (DOE2) = ..033. Polystyrene .0167,
thermal mass wall U = .030.  
Question - which one is better? That's a loaded question but from a
strictly thermal performance measure -  kWh per year to cool - is there
more difference than the .030 vs. .033 U-value would imply?.

We are using eQuest (Doe2.2) and it show the thermal mass as `slightly'
better. The manufacturer, based largely on testimonial evidence, insists
it is MUCH better. 
One issue that they raise is infiltration through the metal skin panels
and the impact on in-situ R value. They site ORNL test results that
apparently show this but I've not seen them. I know ORNL did some
testing on apparent R of mass walls but it didn't seem conclusive to me
that it would apply in this situation.

Anyone out there that can cite well documented research about the
differences? Anyone have comments about DOE2's strengths and weaknesses
in capturing the effects of the large wall thermal mass?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200306241218.AA1810546pd80000337476@gard.com>

The statement below from the several responses I received to my views on energy analysis software shows what A-E design firms have to deal with:

"I think the performance path in many building energy codes is not clearly defined at present. This sometimes makes compliance procedure hard to follow. Even when the performance path is defined, there are always arguments about the modelling assumptions, such as parameters for the reference building and performance of speculative building systems."


We now have to show energy code compliance using energy programs when submitting construction documents. Until recently we had the option of not having to perform energy analysis during the design process.

Several architects prefer to maximize the glass well above 50% (the building now falls in the non-prescriptive category) not just for aesthetic reasons, but also to reduce first costs, exterior maintenance costs and to provide a better indoor environment which in turn translates into higher productivity of the occupants.

In my personal opinion energy software developers should provide examples and documentation of how we would show non-prescriptive compliance using their programs. The code authorities should also explain with examples how we are expected to show non-prescriptive compliance using energy programs and they must indicate which programs are authorized. 

Based on ASHRAE Standard 90.1 most codes categorize buildings into low-rise residential buildings and commercial buildings which includes high-rise residential. Convention centers, performing arts centers, airport terminals, indoor stadiums all fall under commercial. We were once asked to show Std 90.1 compliance for one of these types of buildings using ComCheck-Plus. We need examples of how to show non-prescriptive code compliance for large hospitals and university campuses that include laboratories.

We need energy programs that will show and document code compliance at the construction documents level. In my opinion the DOE2.1E (or DOE2.2 which I have not used) is very suitable for showing code compliance. We first analyze the building model using all prescriptive parameters and then analyze it again with other conditions to produce the same annual energy performance. The Building Description Language (BDL) input of the two cases is included in the report and submitted to the client to show that the modeling was done correctly.

I hope that these views and comments will be of help at the ASHRAE TC 4.7 meeting next week.

The following message was sent to James K. Wilson of ASHRAE TC 4.7.  The file is too big to be distributed to the BLDG-SIM group.  The use of energy software at A-E firms has become very important because of energy codes
 
Varkie Thomas
 
 
To: James K. Wilson
 
Attached is an Excel file that I created that describes the scope of a multi-use building project.  The file is too big for distribution to BLDG-SIM.  You may distribute this at the TC4.7 meeting if you wish.  In practice we do not get architectural drawings that are neatly and conveniently laid out as shown in the attachment.  It illustrates the following
 
1.  Alternative schemes that we consider during the schematic phase of a project.  It emphasizes systems, plant and economics.  Envelope compliance during the schematic phase consists of entering the required U-values, shading coefficients, and percent glass.  Construction documents submission for code compliance will require defining envelope components with layers of materials.
 
2.  Establishing design criteria for projects.  ASHRAE and other standards do not specifically cover all types of spaces.
 
3. Establishing operating schedules for a project.  Although this cancels out when comparing alternatives for a given project, it does not cancel out when comparing similar types of buildings in general by different users.
 
4. The importance and impact of utility rate schedules in making architectural and engineering decisions.
 
The hospital design criteria and schedules was a preliminary effort.  It has since been refined for the given project with the help of the client and hospital consultants.  This is how it is usually done and the information is not always readily available
 
In my personal opinion the priorities for future energy software development are:
 
1.  Documenting code compliance.  Until recently, energy analysis of buildings was optional and A-E firms performed this study during the schematic phase.  Today it is becoming mandatory to show code compliance when submitting construction documents.
 
2.  Creating libraries for (a) design criteria, (b) operating schedules and (c) first and maintenance cost data
 
3. Making the programs easy to use.  This includes good documentation with realistic case studies.  I will be teaching a graduate course at the the Illinois Institute of Technology as an Adjunct Professor.  I hope to create several case studies based on SOM projects for the course.  Although this will be generic, modified and simplified versions to illustrate points, it will still require SOM and client permissions.  I will still be a full time employee of SOM.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Invitation to Participate - Getting the Design Team toUse Energy Simulation from the Beginning


To ALL Interested Parties:
 
In February, a very interesting exchange of ideas occurred on BLDG-SIM at gard.com regarding the limited use of building energy simulation in the early design stages,  thoughts on why its limited,  and what might be done to increase the use of simulations in the early stage of design.  For those who did not see this exchange or would like to refresh their recollection of this, a compilation of these e-mails is found in the attached Word file.  
 
As the Chair of the Applications Subcommittee of ASHRAE TC 4.7- Energy Calculations, I would like to invite anyone and everyone interested in this subject to attend our next TC 4.7 Applications Subcommittee Meeting which will be held on July 1, 2003 from 3:30 to 5:00 p.m.. in Kansas City, Missouri, as part of the ASHRAE Summer Meeting.  (See the meeting program for the meeting location).
 
 
The subject to Getting the Design Team to Use Energy Simulation from the start of Design Process will be our main topic of discussion.  The purpose of this will be to continue this exchange of ideas and from there to create actionable items which will then be implemented.  
 
In some ways we've already started approaching this item.  At the Winter ASHRAE Meeting in Chicago, January 2003,  we presented a Seminar entitled "Getting Started with Building Simulation"  which was chaired by Chip Barnaby.  The four talks were an excellent presentation of "what is energy simulation", "why would I want to do it" and "what's available for doing it".  The third presentation - Allan Daly's presentation of "Using Building Simulation to Life-Cycle Cost Optimize HVAC System Design at UC Merced"  is a case study of project which actually did use simulation in the very early design stages.  Copies of the PowerPoints from each of these four presentations are available to download at the ASHRAE web site ( www.ashrae.org ).  From the homepage, click on "ASHRAE Activities", then Technical Committees, then TC 4.7, then Programs.  Scroll down about a third of the page to previously presented programs.  The seminar was one of the best attended TC 4.7 presentations in recent history (standing room only) which shows that a lot of interest is there, we just need to do a good job of tapping into it.  
 
We welcome the opportunity to broaden the discussion and to broaden the participation.  ASHRAE, with its 55,000 world wide members,  Winter and Summer meetings with 2,500 to 3,500 technical program registrants, and over 160 local chapters,  can provide an effective venue for reaching the building design community.  Our successful "Getting Started with Building Simulation" seminar in Chicago and the ASHRAE Profession Development Session on Building Simulation which is now under development is only a start.  There is much, much more which could and should be done - and we welcome your ideas and involvement.
 
Some of our previous work identified the need for a good basic treatise on what building simulation is, what programs are available, who to contact, etc.  As we research that subject, we were pleased to learn that some excellent sources already existed and/or were nearing completion.  Let me appraise you of them so those who are interested can get a good overview of what is currently available in the building simulation (not just HVAC) arena.  The Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Technology Institute (the research arm of ARI) has available on its web site an report appropriately titled "State-of-the-Art Review, Whole-Building and Bulling Envelope Simulation and Design Tools"  It available at www.arti-21cr.org   There is also a companion report which focuses specifically on HVAC Component and System Simulation.   For specific cost and who to contact information on over 250 energy estimating programs, including most of the simulations DOE maintains a very comprehensive website at  <http://www.energytoolsdirectory.gov> www.energytoolsdirectory.gov 
 
To help us plan a most productive session, I would appreciate your ideas on what you see as:
 
    1.    The most important or critical items that we need to discuss and try to reach consensus in our meeting at Kansas City.
 
    2.    The most important actions or programs our committee should be implementing in the short term (6 to 18 months)
 
    3.    The most important actions or programs our committee should get ASHRAE to implement in the longer term (1 to 5 years)  This could well include research projects.
 
 
For those who will be unable to join us in Kansas City, I invite you to share your ideas via the BLDG-SIM at gard.com list server.  I would ask that you post those ideas by June 20th as my travel schedule will make it difficult for me to print out material to distribute at the Kansas City meeting after that date.

The following are some of my personal views about the use of building energy analysis programs on large and complex building projects. It focuses on the approximate nature of energy analysis relative to the total building design process at A-E design firms such as SOM. Building types at SOM include multi-use office building complexes that include retail, high-rise hotels and residential buildings, airport terminals, convention centers, performing arts centers, large shopping malls, multiple buildings on a university campus or city district, hospitals, etc. The views below are also approximate and not all of them may be valid or accurate and some may be questionable but I hope it will contribute to the discussions at the ASHRAE TC 4.7 meeting this month in Kansas City.  I will not be attending the meeting.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200306191058.AA5853828pd80000333862@gard.com>

This module has never worked ideally in any version of DOE-2.  It is quite common in Australia to have 2-pipe cooling only induction units (active or passive chilled beams) in the zone with ventilation, dehumidification, and heating provided from the primary air system.

In 2.1E you could manually zero out the zone heating capacities and use an outdoor-reset schedule to control SAT for heating and rely on the zone units for space cooling.

I have fiddled around with the IU system all day in EQuest v3.24 and I am no closer to a solution.  It will not allow HEAT-CONTROL = RESET and COOL-CONTROL=RESET does not produce the desired effect.  Furthermore it is allowing zone heating when both my MAX-HEAT-RATE and HEATING-CAPACITY are set to a very small value (-1BTU/hr) ...

Has anyone else had similar difficulties or successes with this system?  I could use 4-pipe fan coils and set up a dummy system passing outdoor air using OA-FROM-SYSTEM, but getting the dehumidifcation load is tricky.

Graham

Dear Ajmi,

You're lucky, I just found an old TRNSYS 14.2 manual (under 1cm
of dust) in my office.

Memories of my youth ... ;-)

There's an export tool in the library manager of IISiBat 2 (an icon with
an arrow pointing to a diskette, 'Export library tool', select a library icon

first). This allows you to create .ia files (IISiBat Archive). On the other
machine you can then load the PROFORMAs back into the
environment with the icon that has the arrow pointing the other way.
Page 24 of the IISiBat 2 manual.

But what I'd realy recommend is to install TRNSYS 15.3 and use
File / Import IISiBat 2 Model to directly import the PROFORMA's
obj file.

Especially if your new PC runs Windows 2000, XP or ME : IISiBat 2
was only supported until NT (in the year 2000).

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200306181356.AA5630187pd80000333028@gard.com>

Hello.

I would like to model temperature reset on on a hot water loop based on
outdoor temperature, using DOE-2.1E, v133. The documentation states that
this is done by setting the PLANT-ASSIGNMENT command HW-SUPPLY-RESET =
LOAD-RESET however this does not seem to make any difference in the energy
consumption results. Any information on whether other keywords need to be
specified would be appreciated, as would any information on the assumptions
in the model (i.e. for what outdoor temperatures is the loop temperature
reset?).

Thanks,
Maria

If you want to do this in Doe2, I've modelled it using
functions. The EnergySmart Pools software has an
appendix that lists the assumptions and calculations
they used. I used these to write the functions in
Doe2. It was a bit of work, but once it's done you
have a lot of flexibility, and I think better
accuracy, particularly if you're using outside air for
your dehumidification.

An indoor pool model is available for TRNSYS 15. You can have a look at 
the pdf manual to decide if the level of detail  is suitable for you:

http://sel.me.wisc.edu/trnsys/components/type144-manual.pdf

Obviously,  making a TRNSYS simulation with a building, a swimming pool 
and the HVAC plant implies a significant development effort but you will 
have the flexibility that goes with it.
Available TRNSYS components are listed on our website:

http://sel.me.wisc.edu/trnsys/   (go to "Component models" and "TRNLIB").


If you have trouble to locate the swimming pool model among the hundreds 
of components, it is in "Component Models", then "non-standard 
components for sale", under  "Transsolar".

I might as well weigh in on this too.  My experience has been that there is 
no readily available model that handles the problem of natatorium 
simulation well.  It's possible that one could use TRNSYS to do this but 
I'm pretty sure that a major investment of development time would be 
needed.  I am responsible for developing a custom spreadsheet based tool 
(along with Marcus Sheffer) that can handle most of the pool HVAC equipment 
on the market.  It is based on the Modified Bin Method and contains 
somewhat simplified models of the building and HVAC systems, but does 
account for their interaction and the large latent loads.

Please contact me if you're interested.

"Prefered tool" depends on who you ask, of course... ;-)

I know that there's a sample TRNSED application for swimming pools
made with TRNSYS 14.2 :

Swimming Pool Air Conditioning Simulation This demonstration models the
use of heat rejected by an air conditioner as a
     source for heating a swimming pool.

I reckon if TRNSYS 14 was able to do it 5 years ago, TRNSYS 15
should not have forgotten...

To my knowledge none of the typical energy simulation software can
adequately simulate natatorium energy use.

We have done energy simulation work for numerous natatoriums using
custom software we have crated for this purpose.  Typically we have used
it to analyze various HVAC options.  There is US DOE-funded software
available free to analyze the use of pool covers and solar water heating
- http://www.eere.energy.gov/rspec/software.
<http://www.eere.energy.gov/rspec/software.html> html
<http://www.eere.energy.gov/rspec/software.html> 

To simulate the whole building we combine the results from our software
with PowerDOE results for the remainder of the facility.

A practical tip for use of the Energy Smart Pools software:  It was created long ago, for Windows 3.1, and was not funded for updates on new operating systems. I think it is FoxPro-based.  I found that it works okay on Win 95 or Win 98 computers, but not Win NT or Win 2000, so if you are having trouble running the program, try loading it on your most obsolete computer.

Also, a building simulation tool called MarketManager includes a module for pool heating.  You may want to experiment with their free demo.  http://www.abraxasenergy.com/marketmanager.php.

Hello:
 
There's a 1985 ASHRAE paper on using DOE-2 to do pool modeling...or at least
attempts to do so, entitled: Haberl, J., Claridge, D. 1985. "Retrofit Energy
Studies of a Recreation Center",  ASHRAE Transactions-Research, Volume 91,
Part 2, pp.  1421 - 1433, (June). In this paper we forced DOE-2 to do the
cooling
and dehumidification, which I is probably not the best tool for doing this
since DOE-2 does not directly control humidity. You should also get the
definitive work by Francis DeWinter, Atlas Corp., written about the same
time on pool heat loss/gain equations and then use something like TRNSYS to
do your own modeling. I'm sure there may already be some good modeling for
doing the pool modeling, and a literature search of the obvious places would
reveal what others have done.  However, combined pool modeling, with
radiative, mass exchange, convection, and system interactions would be a
complex exercise that needs an industrial-strength simulation. Hence the
need for a general purpose solver like TRNSYS or EES, perhaps coupled with a
CFD model that has a radiative network and all the necessary environmental
models (i.e., solar, wind, sky loss, ground coupling, etc.).

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200306130754.AA5435312pd80000329517@gard.com>

Dear Group:

I am looking at a 50.000 indoor pool and my question is this:
Would Visual DOE be the preferred tool to simulate the building.  It will have a dehumidifcation heat pump for the pool and a combination of distributed heat pumps and radiant floor water to water heat pumps fed by an open loop system. 

Thanks

Dear Prof.Eolsen
Dear BLDG-SIM GRoup
Greetings
I agree with your openions; Prof. DR. Eoslen by
hundred per cent,and put them as my openion and my
reply  for the "BLDG-SIM" gard qeuestions with my some
illustrations . So,it is the time to put the things in
their right places . The demostration is very
essential to narrow the gab between the researches and
the practise as announced before last Chicago meeting
;Or, it is the actual process of R&D in the field of
Building and Energy or Building and Environments .
So,the demonstration beside the research project for
integration and for measurring or understanding on the
design and structure elements' activations with the
physical parameters as an analytical and experimental
servey .So, I with Prof. DR. Ahmed shouman ;ENERGy
SYSTEMS in NEW MExico in USA ,have a complete
integration design and we could do the demonstration
as a project in both USA and in Egypt, as Cairo lies
on 30 Lat and also Las CRuce in USA and this practise
in these two loctions will showed the differences and
requirements of applications and the handling view due
to that at these different cities,and enhances the
openion giving by some -as Mr. J. Deringer- for the
requirements in developing countries - through the
discussion about a project given by USA Assoisated
engineering for TC2.8 - as I remembered- So, If we
could funded to carry this demonstration as an
application and surveying project of researches to
stand on the exact needs of all works and their
related connections in the developing building field.
if there are a proplem in getting  land to build these
deonstrations , there are land could introduce for
that in Cairo -egypt and other could introduce in Las
cruce in USA  by PRof. DR. Ahmed Shouman ; that is to
enable the valuable works lines in their correct ways.
Thanks alot for all

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200306101742.AA425415pd80000327275@gard.com>

I am unable to make the Kansas City meeting, so I am emailing my response as
requested.  

    1.    The most important or critical items that we need to discuss and
try to reach consensus in our meeting at Kansas City.

I have two points to discuss:

a) I hope that the we can avoid using the term "Building Simulation" as a
substitute for "Energy Simulation." I believe it is important embrace the
larger class of building simulation tools (CFD, network airflow models,
daylighting analysis, etc.), as mentioned at the beginning at some of the
presentations from the January ASHRAE meeting. Although I understand the
committee is termed "Energy Calculations," if the final goal is to see these
tools used in practice, they cannot be approached in isolation. Although
energy simulation is perhaps the most commonly used tool, and is clearly
very powerful, if we view the project form a designer's perspective, the
question is "What tools can I use to improve my design?" (and be sure it
will perform as intended). Sometimes energy simulation provides the answer,
sometimes another type of simulation may provide the answer.

b) My impression is that there is currently much focus on the technical
barriers to integration in the design process, especially improving
interoperability and interfaces.  Although these are important and worthy
efforts, perhaps a large problem is process barrier.  I sense that most of
the architectural design community won't integrate these tools into the
early design process until they understand what they can really do, and
especially that it makes designs that wouldn't have been possible without
out them possible.  If you're just talking about optimizing a few
architectural details, or the building orientation, or the mechanical
systems, you may have a hard time finding an architect that is interested,
especially in the early design stages (even if these are all great things to
do).  However, if you can explore a design concept that you couldn't before,
because you can demonstrate that it actually works, then the story may be
different. If we can demonstrate the power of building simulation tools to
allow truly innovative designs, then perhaps demand will increase. If the
demand exists, perhaps the technical problems mentioned above can be solved
more quickly.

    3.    The most important actions or programs our committee should get
ASHRAE to implement in the longer term (1 to 5 years)  This could well
include research projects.

OK, so what do you do about it? Well I have one concept that I will throw
out, which may not fall into the normal ASHRAE funding pot, but I want to at
least share the idea. This is what you might call a 'Modeler in Residence'
program (thanks to Mike Witte for coining the term). In order to demonstrate
what can be done, you provide funding for someone to work in-house at an
architecture or architecture/engineering firm. The Modeler in Residence
would identify opportunities within existing projects to apply building
simulation tools, essentially working as an externally funded member of the
design team. Hopefully most of the work performed makes an actual impact on
the design, but even if not, the goal is to demonstrate this process and the
its product to the design team (and the client).

These are my thought on this issue - I don't claim to know all the issues
involved, or have all the answers, but I hope that this provides valuable
input for further discussion.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200306031529.AA2957109pd80000323251@gard.com>

Thanks to all who responded to my last question.  I have another question related to the ASHRAE Energy Cost Budget method.

In the notes following Table 11.4.3A in the Energy Cost Budget section of ASHRAE 90.1 (11-A in the User's Manual), note 6 states that "hot water supply temperature shall be modeled at 180 [degrees] F design supply temperature and 130 [degrees] F return temperature."  That's a hot water system DT of 50F!  When a DT of 20-30F is pretty standard, 50F seems awfully aggressive (and difficult to design).  Does anyone have any insight into what I'm missing here?

	 Design
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200306031255.AA5512937pd80000323160@gard.com>

 My apologies for any cross postings.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =
"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /> 

 Dear colleagues,

The National Research Council Canada and Natural Resources Canada have
released an online RADIANCE-based daylighting analysis tool called the
Lightswitch Wizard www.buildwiz.com <http://www.buildwiz.com> . 

The tool has been developed to support daylighting-related design decisions
in commercial buildings during an early design stage. It offers a
comparative, reliable, and fast analysis of the amount of daylight available
in peripheral private offices as well as the lighting energy performance of
automated lighting controls (occupancy sensors, photocells) compared to
standard on/off switches. Blinds are either manually or automatically
controlled. 

Simulation results are based on pre-calculated RADIANCE simulations which
are coupled with an empirical model that mimics manual lighting and blind
control in single offices. Further information is provided in the online
technical background, and glossary sections.

A simulation should take between 20 seconds and 3 minutes to run, assuming
moderate traffic on the server and a fast internet connection. 

Your comments/suggestions are appreciated. Greetings from Ottawa,

Christoph

In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200306021141.AA4104656pd80000468911@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200306021759.AA5909484pd80000322622@gard.com>

A little off the direct question of this thread, but
just a comment on what might be a difference in
philosophy between minimum code compliance and LEED
certification.  Question: would we want to permit a
building owner to install single pane instead of
double pane windows because he claims to have put
demand ventilation controls in the building?  

While not an issue for someone seeing by how much they
can exceed the minimum, it is a question for the code
end of the work.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] LEED / ASHRAE 90.1 Modeling Question
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200306021131.AA3158296pd80000322295@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200306021141.AA4101671pd80000322313@gard.com>

The Standard 90.1 committee has recognized the difference 
between a pass/fail compliance and a savings calculation 
and is in the process of developing informative Appendix G 
"Performance Rating Method" just to cope with these very 
issues. Appendix G is just about to finish up its second 
public review and will be hopefully published within a 
year.  One excerpt from the draft says:

"G3.11 Schedules. Schedules capable of modeling hourly 
variations in occupancy, lighting power, miscellaneous 
equipment power, thermostat set points, and HVAC system 
operation shall be used. The schedules shall be typical of 
the proposed building type as determined by the designer 
and approved by the rating authority. Schedules shall be 
identical for the proposed design and baseline building
design.

"Exception to G3.11: Schedules may be allowed to differ 
between proposed design and baseline building design with 
approval of the rating authority when necessary to model 
nonstandard efficiency measures. Measures that may warrant 
use of different schedules include, but are not limited to, 
lighting controls, natural ventilation, demand control 
ventilation, and measures that reduce service water heating
loads."

I know this does not help today but it will in the future.

Wade,
 
We are in the process of submitting a CIR that will explicitly state the
method we are using and the fundamentals behind it that meet the intent of
the Exceptional Calculation Method as stated in ASHRAE 90.1. We also feel
there is conflicting information on this and are hoping to clarify the
issue.

Thanks for your reply.
 
I re-read a CIR from 6/7/2001 (perhaps the one to which you are referring?)
to be sure that I hadn't missed anything.  In the Project Manager's Ruling,
it says:"Under the ECM [Exceptional Calculation Method], schedule variations
may be used as a basis of engineering calculations for discrete measures
that are precluded by the reference standard or the LEEDTM EMP."
 
However, the description of the ECM  in section 11.5 of the 90.1 manual
states that the applicant must provide documentation supporting the accuracy
of the exceptional method and that "This documentation must also show that
the methods and its results:
1. Do not change the simulation program input parameters that are
constrained by the ECM method or any other rules of the adopting authority.
For example, the exceptional method may not violate the rule against using
different operating schedules for proposed and budget runs."
 
So it is still unclear to me whether or not schedule changes are acceptable.
Have you successfully proposed schedule changes such as these through the
ECM process?

I'd suggest you review the CIRs more closely.  DCV has been approved as an
energy saving measure and you can modify schedules to simulate savings.  You
must follow the Exceptional Calculation Method (section 11.5) of the Energy
Cost Budget Method of 90.1.

Hi All,
 
We are currently working on our first LEED certification project.  We use
PowerDOE as a modeling tool, but these questions should apply to all
modeling platforms.
 
The LEED process requires modeling practices to follow those outlined in the
ASHRAE 90.1 Standard User's Manual.  The standard does not allow for the
augmentation of schedules to model efficiency measures.  This is a problem
for us in that we often use schedules to simulate measures such as lighting
occupancy sensors and demand controlled ventilation.
 
Typically:
-For lighting occupancy sensors, we adjust our known office schedules using
a profile taken from the JIES (I'm afraid I don't have the specific source
in front of me).
-For demand controlled ventilation, we develop an hourly outside air
Fraction of Design schedule for each AHU using known occupancy schedules and
an assumption of 20 CFM per occupant.
 
To us, both of these methods seem to be accepted modeling practice for
determining measure performance.  However, as stated pretty explicitly in
the archived credit interpretation requests (CIRs) on the LEED site, LEED
won't allow for the adjustment of schedules to simulate these measures.
Does anyone have a method (or insight into developing a method) for either
of these calculations in a manner that would be acceptable for the LEED
process?
 
Many thanks in advance for your responses.

We will be submitting some shortly and this is how we have interpreted the 
CIRs.  Schedule changes are acceptable is my understanding.  The adopting 
authority in this case is the USGBC and they have stated that schedule 
changes are allowable for DCV.  To be 100% sure, develop your methodology 
for calculating savings and submit it as a CIR.

Thanks for your reply.

I re-read a CIR from 6/7/2001 (perhaps the one to which you are referring?) to be sure that I hadn't missed anything.  In the Project Manager's Ruling, it says:"Under the ECM [Exceptional Calculation Method], schedule variations may be used as a basis of engineering calculations for discrete measures that are precluded by the reference standard or the LEEDTM EMP."

However, the description of the ECM  in section 11.5 of the 90.1 manual states that the applicant must provide documentation supporting the accuracy of the exceptional method and that "This documentation must also show that the methods and its results:
1. Do not change the simulation program input parameters that are constrained by the ECM method or any other rules of the adopting authority.  For example, the exceptional method may not violate the rule against using different operating schedules for proposed and budget runs."

So it is still unclear to me whether or not schedule changes are acceptable.  Have you successfully proposed schedule changes such as these through the ECM process?

  I'd suggest you review the CIRs more closely.  DCV has been approved as an energy saving measure and you can modify schedules to simulate savings.  You must follow the Exceptional Calculation Method (section 11.5) of the Energy Cost Budget Method of 90.1.

However, as stated pretty explicitly in the archived credit interpretation requests (CIRs) on the LEED site, LEED won't allow for the adjustment of schedules to simulate these measures.  Does anyone have a method (or insight into developing a method) for either of these calculations in a manner that would be acceptable for the LEED process?

Hi All,

We are currently working on our first LEED certification project.  We use PowerDOE as a modeling tool, but these questions should apply to all modeling platforms.

The LEED process requires modeling practices to follow those outlined in the ASHRAE 90.1 Standard User's Manual.  The standard does not allow for the augmentation of schedules to model efficiency measures.  This is a problem for us in that we often use schedules to simulate measures such as lighting occupancy sensors and demand controlled ventilation.

Typically:
-For lighting occupancy sensors, we adjust our known office schedules using a profile taken from the JIES (I'm afraid I don't have the specific source in front of me).
-For demand controlled ventilation, we develop an hourly outside air Fraction of Design schedule for each AHU using known occupancy schedules and an assumption of 20 CFM per occupant.

To us, both of these methods seem to be accepted modeling practice for determining measure performance.  However, as stated pretty explicitly in the archived credit interpretation requests (CIRs) on the LEED site, LEED won't allow for the adjustment of schedules to simulate these measures.  Does anyone have a method (or insight into developing a method) for either of these calculations in a manner that would be acceptable for the LEED process?

Many thanks in advance for your responses.

Subject: Invitation to Participate - Getting the Design Team to Use Energy Simulation from the Beginning


To ALL Interested Parties:

In February, a very interesting exchange of ideas occurred on BLDG-SIM at gard.com regarding the limited use of building energy simulation in the early design stages,  thoughts on why its limited,  and what might be done to increase the use of simulations in the early stage of design.  For those who did not see this exchange or would like to refresh their recollection of this, a compilation of these e-mails is found in the attached Word file.  

As the Chair of the Applications Subcommittee of ASHRAE TC 4.7- Energy Calculations, I would like to invite anyone and everyone interested in this subject to attend our next TC 4.7 Applications Subcommittee Meeting which will be held on July 1, 2003 from 3:30 to 5:00 p.m.. in Kansas City, Missouri, as part of the ASHRAE Summer Meeting.  (See the meeting program for the meeting location).


The subject to Getting the Design Team to Use Energy Simulation from the start of Design Process will be our main topic of discussion.  The purpose of this will be to continue this exchange of ideas and from there to create actionable items which will then be implemented.  

In some ways we've already started approaching this item.  At the Winter ASHRAE Meeting in Chicago, January 2003,  we presented a Seminar entitled "Getting Started with Building Simulation"  which was chaired by Chip Barnaby.  The four talks were an excellent presentation of "what is energy simulation", "why would I want to do it" and "what's available for doing it".  The third presentation - Allan Daly's presentation of "Using Building Simulation to Life-Cycle Cost Optimize HVAC System Design at UC Merced"  is a case study of project which actually did use simulation in the very early design stages.  Copies of the PowerPoints from each of these four presentations are available to download at the ASHRAE web site (www.ashrae.org ).  From the homepage, click on "ASHRAE Activities", then Technical Committees, then TC 4.7, then Programs.  Scroll down about a third of the page to previously presented programs.  The seminar was one of the best attended TC 4.7 presentations in recent history (standing room only) which shows that a lot of interest is there, we just need to do a good job of tapping into it.  

We welcome the opportunity to broaden the discussion and to broaden the participation.  ASHRAE, with its 55,000 world wide members,  Winter and Summer meetings with 2,500 to 3,500 technical program registrants, and over 160 local chapters,  can provide an effective venue for reaching the building design community.  Our successful "Getting Started with Building Simulation" seminar in Chicago and the ASHRAE Profession Development Session on Building Simulation which is now under development is only a start.  There is much, much more which could and should be done - and we welcome your ideas and involvement.

Some of our previous work identified the need for a good basic treatise on what building simulation is, what programs are available, who to contact, etc.  As we research that subject, we were pleased to learn that some excellent sources already existed and/or were nearing completion.  Let me appraise you of them so those who are interested can get a good overview of what is currently available in the building simulation (not just HVAC) arena.  The Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Technology Institute (the research arm of ARI) has available on its web site an report appropriately titled "State-of-the-Art Review, Whole-Building and Bulling Envelope Simulation and Design Tools"  It available at www.arti-21cr.org   There is also a companion report which focuses specifically on HVAC Component and System Simulation.   For specific cost and who to contact information on over 250 energy estimating programs, including most of the simulations DOE maintains a very comprehensive website at www.energytoolsdirectory.gov 

To help us plan a most productive session, I would appreciate your ideas on what you see as:

    1.    The most important or critical items that we need to discuss and try to reach consensus in our meeting at Kansas City.

    2.    The most important actions or programs our committee should be implementing in the short term (6 to 18 months)

    3.    The most important actions or programs our committee should get ASHRAE to implement in the longer term (1 to 5 years)  This could well include research projects.


For those who will be unable to join us in Kansas City, I invite you to share your ideas via the BLDG-SIM at gard.com list server.  I would ask that you post those ideas by June 20th as my travel schedule will make it difficult for me to print out material to distribute at the Kansas City meeting after that date.
