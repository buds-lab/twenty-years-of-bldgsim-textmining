Brad,

 

Here are my understandings.

 

1.	Qualified computer software for purpose of Energy Efficient
Commercial Building Tax Deduction under IRS Code 179D are four (4):

	a.	Trace 700
	b.	Energy Plus
	c.	HAP
	d.	Visual DOE

The e-Quest is not on the list.

 

2.	My reading to IRS notice 2006-052 is that, either to achieve
total 50% saving to get $1.80/sf, or to achieve 16-2/3% individually for
each subject of the three to get $0.60/sf for each subject.  This is a
clear-cut deal, and does not count for partial credit if total below
50%.

 

 

Regards,

 

Shawn Lee

Two energy incentive questions for the group:

 

 

1.       Does anyone know the status of eQuest with regard to it's
listing by the DOE as approved software for compliance with the 2005
e-pact energy tax incentives?

 

2.       With respect to "partially qualifying property" section 2
paragraph .03 of IRS notice 2006-052. Does anyone have an opinion as to
the intent of breaking the "property" into three components; Envelope,
HVAC, and Lighting? If a building cannot beat 90.1-2001 by 50%, must the
budget building be modeled against the same building with only the
lighting changed, and beat 90.1 by 16.7% in order to achieve partial
credit of $0.60/SF? Or can the proposed building with all ECM's be
modeled against the budget building and achieve partial credit? If the
intent of E-pact is to encourage energy efficient buildings, it seams
that save 20% and 30% over 90.1 would be eligible for partial credit.

 

Thanks for your input,

 

Brad

There is no specific temperature range called out but Section G3.1.2.2
does limit the number of unmet heating and cooling hours your simulation
can have.  The heating and cooling schedules you establish would be the
required high / low temperatures you would need to meet.  
 
Again my interpretation of the Exception Calculation methodology is that
if I feel the design I am modeling doesn't need to meet G3.1.2.2 then I
need to argue the case why.

Ramana,
 
The ASHRAE 90.1 ECB sub-committee is working on a methodology for
simulating natural ventilation within the framework of Appendix G but I
don't think its finished yet.  In the meantime here is what I would
recommend.
 
Appendix G / 90.1 ECB allows you to use an exception calculation method
to simulate hybrid systems or unique efficiency measures to demonstrate
above-standard performance.  I think this would certainly apply in your
case.   
 
Here's what I have done on projects requiring an exception calculation
method.  
1. Establish your energy cost budget and your design energy case
following the Appendix G guidelines.  
2. Create a second model using the Design Energy Case as the baseline
and make the necessary modifications to simulate radiant heating / no
cooling via natural ventilation.  
3. Report the energy savings from your exception calculation as a line
item at the end of your LEED EA-1 summary table (similar to how
renewable energy is reported). 
4.  Include a seperate summary table  for the exception calculation
showing the energy end-use breakdown and how you arrived at the cost
savings.  Show both the baseline and proposed energy use.  
5. Make sure the savings are reasonable and prudent for the system you
are proposing.  
6. Document any changes to the model especially changes to schedules
that were necessary to properly simulate your system. 
7. Make it easy for someone to review your assumptions and the
methodology you used to estimate the savings
 
I hope this helps.  Good luck.

Dear all,

Is ignoring natural ventilation in both proposed and baseline designs an
accepted/fair way of modeling based on Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1-2004)?

Part of the proposed design has (radiant heating + natural ventilation)
with no cooling which was modeled as a radiant slab, no cooling, natural
ventilation ignored. 

But the Baseline HVAC system based on Appendix G is System 5: Packaged
VAV w/Reheat. (Natural ventilation can be modeled based on Air Change
method or Sherman Grimsrud method though I do not know how to do it).

I cannot decide how to make the baseline and proposed comparable with
respect to Natural Ventilation (in a manner acceptable to LEED review),
suggestions will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Marcus,
 
ASHRAE changed their procedures a while back. Now after an addendum
goes through public review and is approved, it is not posted on the
website as an individual addendum. Instead, it is held until the half
way point between releases of 90.1, and then released as a package
containing all approved addenda. If an addendum was approved after the
halfway point, it is held until the next full version release. This is
the case with Addendum AG. If you go to the ASHRAE Stadards Addenda
page, http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/132   at the bottom of the
page, you can find a link to the addenda index and see the status of AG,
but the actual text is not available. I know that makes it hard to
follow the current state of the Standard, but that is what ASHRAE has
chosen to do.

Marcus,

I am on the ASHRAE 90.1 ECB subcommittee. I do not think at this point
that we are working on any additional methodology to credit natural
ventilation. Addendum AG already changed the following:

In the proposed building.
HVAC Fan Schedules. Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air
for ventilation shall run continuously whenever spaces are occupied
and
shall be cycled on and off to meet heating and cooling loads during
unoccupied hours. 

This implies that HVAC fans that are only meeting thermal load may
cycle on and off, and was meant to allow fan credit for natural
ventilation system (as simple as operable windows). The proposed
building still calls for cooling as a requirement, but the thought is,
that if model simulates natural ventilation and the cooling load is
met
that way, the fan and cooling coil will not operate to meet load and
the
design will be credited. The problem is that most LEED models are done
using DOE2, which has severe limitations when it comes to modeling
natural ventilation. It is my understanding that other programs do a
better job of this.  

The subcommittee also thought that an exceptional calculation method
might be used if the natural ventilation simulation was be done in a
stand alone program and then an appropriate infiltration schedule was
input into a program like DOE2, reducing the use of mechanical
cooling.

Mike,



The exception calculation method you describe is absolutely correct.



Obtaining savings for natural ventilation within LEED however is
another
story.  I am one of the certification reviewers and also vice-chair of
the
EA TAG.  My understanding is that to date the USGBC has not allowed
natural
ventilation to fully count under EAc1 even if submitted as an
exceptional
calculation method.  The TAG is awaiting the work of the 90.1
subcommittee
you mention to develop a uniform methodology.



Perhaps your submission will be the one to set the precedent.  Thanks
to all
for helping to blaze the trail.

I second this thought - it would sure go a long-long way in reducing our

Michael,

I cannot find Addendum AG - it is not on the list of approved addenda and I
cannot find it under the public review drafts.  Can you point me to where I
might find it?

Marcus,

I am on the ASHRAE 90.1 ECB subcommittee. I do not think at this point
that we are working on any additional methodology to credit natural
ventilation. Addendum AG already changed the following:

In the proposed building.
HVAC Fan Schedules. Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air
for ventilation shall run continuously whenever spaces are occupied and
shall be cycled on and off to meet heating and cooling loads during
unoccupied hours. 

This implies that HVAC fans that are only meeting thermal load may
cycle on and off, and was meant to allow fan credit for natural
ventilation system (as simple as operable windows). The proposed
building still calls for cooling as a requirement, but the thought is,
that if model simulates natural ventilation and the cooling load is met
that way, the fan and cooling coil will not operate to meet load and the
design will be credited. The problem is that most LEED models are done
using DOE2, which has severe limitations when it comes to modeling
natural ventilation. It is my understanding that other programs do a
better job of this.  

The subcommittee also thought that an exceptional calculation method
might be used if the natural ventilation simulation was be done in a
stand alone program and then an appropriate infiltration schedule was
input into a program like DOE2, reducing the use of mechanical cooling.

Mike,

 

The exception calculation method you describe is absolutely correct.

 

Obtaining savings for natural ventilation within LEED however is
another
story.  I am one of the certification reviewers and also vice-chair of
the
EA TAG.  My understanding is that to date the USGBC has not allowed
natural
ventilation to fully count under EAc1 even if submitted as an
exceptional
calculation method.  The TAG is awaiting the work of the 90.1
subcommittee
you mention to develop a uniform methodology.

 

Perhaps your submission will be the one to set the precedent.  Thanks
to all
for helping to blaze the trail.

Have you succeeded in getting a naturally ventilated building through
the
USGBC with this method?

 

If so, I am sure all would be glad to hear it.

Ramana,

 

The ASHRAE 90.1 ECB sub-committee is working on a methodology for
simulating
natural ventilation within the framework of Appendix G but I don't
think its
finished yet.  In the meantime here is what I would recommend.

 

Appendix G / 90.1 ECB allows you to use an exception calculation method
to
simulate hybrid systems or unique efficiency measures to demonstrate
above-standard performance.  I think this would certainly apply in
your
case.   

 

Here's what I have done on projects requiring an exception calculation
method.  

1. Establish your energy cost budget and your design energy case
following
the Appendix G guidelines.  

2. Create a second model using the Design Energy Case as the baseline
and
make the necessary modifications to simulate radiant heating / no
cooling
via natural ventilation.  

3. Report the energy savings from your exception calculation as a line
item
at the end of your LEED EA-1 summary table (similar to how renewable
energy
is reported). 

4.  Include a seperate summary table  for the exception calculation
showing
the energy end-use breakdown and how you arrived at the cost savings. 
Show
both the baseline and proposed energy use.  

5. Make sure the savings are reasonable and prudent for the system you
are
proposing.  

6. Document any changes to the model especially changes to schedules
that
were necessary to properly simulate your system. 

7. Make it easy for someone to review your assumptions and the
methodology
you used to estimate the savings

 

I hope this helps.  Good luck.

 

Mike

Dear all,

Is ignoring natural ventilation in both proposed and baseline designs
an
accepted/fair way of modeling based on Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1-2004)?

Part of the proposed design has (radiant heating + natural ventilation)
with
no cooling which was modeled as a radiant slab, no cooling, natural
ventilation ignored. 

But the Baseline HVAC system based on Appendix G is System 5: Packaged
VAV
w/Reheat. (Natural ventilation can be modeled based on Air Change
method or
Sherman Grimsrud method though I do not know how to do it).

I cannot decide how to make the baseline and proposed comparable with
respect to Natural Ventilation (in a manner acceptable to LEED
review),
suggestions will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Note that the wizard will not call out the insulation with its name - it will create a custom resistance layer with the calculated effective R-value.

Did you account for the framing?  If you used the wizard and selected say a 2x6 metal stud wall with R-19 you will get the derated value of the insulation due to the studs.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200612212019.AA1914593pd80001346339@gard.com>

Mark,
 
I think the basic problem with the curve as you have defined it is that,
for a given flow rate, delta-T is dependent on firing rate, and thus the
value of the leaving water temperature cannot be assumed and must be
calculated.  This however can easily done, using the given firing rate
for each entering water temperature value.
 
That being said, the Aerco curve as presented I think is somewhat
ambiguous, and requires a few engineering assumptions to solve
definitively.
 
As I know this is bound to come up very soon in one or more of the
projects I've got sitting in front of me, I spent a little time today
reasoning this out and have published the results in my ongoing ELCCA
Exchange blog:
 
 
http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/2006/12/equest-boiler-curve-example.h
tml
 
 
If you wouldn't mind, please let me know how the curve fit data works...
I don't have a live project just yet with a condensing boiler to test it
on.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST Condensing Boiler Curve



Using eQUEST v.3.6, I've taken a stab at creating a performance curve
for an Aerco KC1000 condensing boiler. I've defined BOILER:HIR-FT =
"Aerco-KC1000-HIR-fEWT&LWT" as shown below. This boiler is being used
for a water source heat pump condenser water loop with a CT/HX & two
condensing boilers, piped in a primary loop configuration.

"Aerco-KC1000-HIR-fEWT&LWT" = CURVE-FIT       
   TYPE             = BI-QUADRATIC-T 
   INPUT-TYPE       = DATA 
   INDEPENDENT-1    = ( 180, 180, 180, 80, 80, 80, 100, 100, 100, 120,
120, 
         120, 140, 140, 140, 160, 160, 160 ) 
   INDEPENDENT-2    = ( 180, 90, 135, 90, 135, 180, 90, 135, 180, 90,
135, 
         180, 90, 135, 180, 90, 135, 180 ) 
   DEPENDENT        = ( 1, 1.023, 1.019, 1.151, 1.077, 1.065, 1.102,
1.047, 
         1.038, 1.053, 1.026, 1.017, 1.033, 1.017, 1.012, 1.023, 1.017, 
         1.007 ) 
   .. 

Question: Is this a proper curve for this equipment? Any comments and
critiques would be much appreciated. Part of my difficulty is that
HIR-FT is a Bi-Quadratic-T or Bi-Linear-T curve that needs two
temperatures (EWT & LWT) to define the HIR ratio modifier. When looking
at the curves, it's stated as thermal efficiency vs. EWT (return water
temperature) on several different curves based on fire rate of the
boiler. Basically, I assumed a LWT based on firing rate (90F=25%,
135F=75% & 180F=100%). I'm not sure if this is reasonable or not. Per
the manual, the DEPENDENT variable is the ratio of the actual efficiency
(based on the curves) / rated efficiency (at full fire, full load).
INDEPENDENT-1 = EWT, INDEPENDENT-2 = LWT.

That makes sense to me. You might get a little additional savings due to
the fact that you are not adding heat from the fan to the airstream with
natural ventilation, as you would with an economizer.

I will be using eQuest to model a complex of housing units and will be
examining two possible RE technologies for implementation: One is a ground
source heat pump (gshp) and the other is a wood pellet stove.

IF anyone has experience incorporating one or both of these systems into a
simulation any advice would be appreciated:

Specifically:
-Wood stove--what is the best way to represent a heat source like this?
-tips or tricks to avoid problems
-Validation of results

thanks a lot

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200612211607.AA0738125pd80001346146@gard.com>

Can EQUEST differentiate between spray-on and batt insulation for exterior wall?
   
  My understanding was that EQUEST could differentiate between the  two materials as there were options for polyisocyanurate and batt insulation in the drop down menu for wall construction. Moreover, there was a difference in results when I simulated the two options.
   
  However, on examining the detailed input made for batt insulation, it did not make any sense! I could not see the properties of the batt insulation anywhere in the input!
   
  Any suggestion/ advise is greatly appreciated.
  Thank you for your time and patience.

Marcus,

I am on the ASHRAE 90.1 ECB subcommittee. I do not think at this point
that we are working on any additional methodology to credit natural
ventilation. Addendum AG already changed the following:

In the proposed building.
HVAC Fan Schedules. Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air
for ventilation shall run continuously whenever spaces are occupied and
shall be cycled on and off to meet heating and cooling loads during
unoccupied hours. 

This implies that HVAC fans that are only meeting thermal load may
cycle on and off, and was meant to allow fan credit for natural
ventilation system (as simple as operable windows). The proposed
building still calls for cooling as a requirement, but the thought is,
that if model simulates natural ventilation and the cooling load is met
that way, the fan and cooling coil will not operate to meet load and the
design will be credited. The problem is that most LEED models are done
using DOE2, which has severe limitations when it comes to modeling
natural ventilation. It is my understanding that other programs do a
better job of this.  

The subcommittee also thought that an exceptional calculation method
might be used if the natural ventilation simulation was be done in a
stand alone program and then an appropriate infiltration schedule was
input into a program like DOE2, reducing the use of mechanical cooling.

Mike,

 

The exception calculation method you describe is absolutely correct.

 

Obtaining savings for natural ventilation within LEED however is
another
story.  I am one of the certification reviewers and also vice-chair of
the
EA TAG.  My understanding is that to date the USGBC has not allowed
natural
ventilation to fully count under EAc1 even if submitted as an
exceptional
calculation method.  The TAG is awaiting the work of the 90.1
subcommittee
you mention to develop a uniform methodology.

 

Perhaps your submission will be the one to set the precedent.  Thanks
to all
for helping to blaze the trail.

Ramana,

 

The ASHRAE 90.1 ECB sub-committee is working on a methodology for
simulating
natural ventilation within the framework of Appendix G but I don't
think its
finished yet.  In the meantime here is what I would recommend.

 

Appendix G / 90.1 ECB allows you to use an exception calculation method
to
simulate hybrid systems or unique efficiency measures to demonstrate
above-standard performance.  I think this would certainly apply in
your
case.   

 

Here's what I have done on projects requiring an exception calculation
method.  

1. Establish your energy cost budget and your design energy case
following
the Appendix G guidelines.  

2. Create a second model using the Design Energy Case as the baseline
and
make the necessary modifications to simulate radiant heating / no
cooling
via natural ventilation.  

3. Report the energy savings from your exception calculation as a line
item
at the end of your LEED EA-1 summary table (similar to how renewable
energy
is reported). 

4.  Include a seperate summary table  for the exception calculation
showing
the energy end-use breakdown and how you arrived at the cost savings. 
Show
both the baseline and proposed energy use.  

5. Make sure the savings are reasonable and prudent for the system you
are
proposing.  

6. Document any changes to the model especially changes to schedules
that
were necessary to properly simulate your system. 

7. Make it easy for someone to review your assumptions and the
methodology
you used to estimate the savings

 

I hope this helps.  Good luck.

 

Mike

Dear all,

Is ignoring natural ventilation in both proposed and baseline designs
an
accepted/fair way of modeling based on Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1-2004)?

Part of the proposed design has (radiant heating + natural ventilation)
with
no cooling which was modeled as a radiant slab, no cooling, natural
ventilation ignored. 

But the Baseline HVAC system based on Appendix G is System 5: Packaged
VAV
w/Reheat. (Natural ventilation can be modeled based on Air Change
method or
Sherman Grimsrud method though I do not know how to do it).

I cannot decide how to make the baseline and proposed comparable with
respect to Natural Ventilation (in a manner acceptable to LEED
review),
suggestions will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Subject: [bldg-sim] Modeling buildings with natural ventilation for
Appendix G


Dear all,

Is ignoring natural ventilation in both proposed and baseline designs an
accepted/fair way of modeling based on Appendix G (ASHRAE 90.1-2004)?

Part of the proposed design has (radiant heating + natural ventilation)
with no cooling which was modeled as a radiant slab, no cooling, natural
ventilation ignored. 

But the Baseline HVAC system based on Appendix G is System 5: Packaged
VAV w/Reheat. (Natural ventilation can be modeled based on Air Change
method or Sherman Grimsrud method though I do not know how to do it).

I cannot decide how to make the baseline and proposed comparable with
respect to Natural Ventilation (in a manner acceptable to LEED review),
suggestions will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Mike,
 
Have you succeeded in getting a naturally ventilated building through
the USGBC with this method?
 
If so, I am sure all would be glad to hear it.

Ramana,
 
The ASHRAE 90.1 ECB sub-committee is working on a methodology for
simulating natural ventilation within the framework of Appendix G but I
don't think its finished yet.  In the meantime here is what I would
recommend.
 
Appendix G / 90.1 ECB allows you to use an exception calculation method
to simulate hybrid systems or unique efficiency measures to demonstrate
above-standard performance.  I think this would certainly apply in your
case.   
 
Here's what I have done on projects requiring an exception calculation
method.  
1. Establish your energy cost budget and your design energy case
following the Appendix G guidelines.  
2. Create a second model using the Design Energy Case as the baseline
and make the necessary modifications to simulate radiant heating / no
cooling via natural ventilation.  
3. Report the energy savings from your exception calculation as a line
item at the end of your LEED EA-1 summary table (similar to how
renewable energy is reported). 
4.  Include a seperate summary table  for the exception calculation
showing the energy end-use breakdown and how you arrived at the cost
savings.  Show both the baseline and proposed energy use.  
5. Make sure the savings are reasonable and prudent for the system you
are proposing.  
6. Document any changes to the model especially changes to schedules
that were necessary to properly simulate your system. 
7. Make it easy for someone to review your assumptions and the
methodology you used to estimate the savings
 
I hope this helps.  Good luck.

The best way to test custom curve fits is to use the boiler hourly
reports and check the efficiency/fuel consumption that is being

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST Condensing Boiler Curve



Using eQUEST v.3.6, I've taken a stab at creating a performance curve
for an Aerco KC1000 condensing boiler. I've defined BOILER:HIR-FT =
"Aerco-KC1000-HIR-fEWT&LWT" as shown below. This boiler is being used
for a water source heat pump condenser water loop with a CT/HX & two
condensing boilers, piped in a primary loop configuration.

"Aerco-KC1000-HIR-fEWT&LWT" = CURVE-FIT       
   TYPE             = BI-QUADRATIC-T 
   INPUT-TYPE       = DATA 
   INDEPENDENT-1    = ( 180, 180, 180, 80, 80, 80, 100, 100, 100, 120,
120, 
         120, 140, 140, 140, 160, 160, 160 ) 
   INDEPENDENT-2    = ( 180, 90, 135, 90, 135, 180, 90, 135, 180, 90,
135, 
         180, 90, 135, 180, 90, 135, 180 )

         1.007 ) 
   .. 

Question: Is this a proper curve for this equipment? Any comments and
critiques would be much appreciated. Part of my difficulty is that
HIR-FT is a Bi-Quadratic-T or Bi-Linear-T curve that needs two
temperatures (EWT & LWT) to define the HIR ratio modifier. When looking
at the curves, it's stated as thermal efficiency vs. EWT (return water
temperature) on several different curves based on fire rate of the
boiler. Basically, I assumed a LWT based on firing rate (90F=25%,
135F=75% & 180F=100%). I'm not sure if this is reasonable or not. Per
the manual, the DEPENDENT variable is the ratio of the actual efficiency
(based on the curves) / rated efficiency (at full fire, full load).
INDEPENDENT-1 = EWT, INDEPENDENT-2 = LWT.

Brian,
PV Watts assumes several variables which are constant. I am also a rep for PowerLight, who has installed the largest solar systems in the world, out of Berkeley, California. PowerLight uses their own simulation program based originally on PV Watts but more detailed to more accurately predict solar performance. Their estimated energy output is also usually lower than PV Watts predicted values since they often have to guarantee performance over 20+ years. We also do have a solar specialist in house who writes his own hourly simulation programs for solar, wind and distributed generation systems.

I am simulating a 28.1 kW array in DOE-2 (eQuest 3.6) and in PV Watts.  The array is flat, on a rooftop with 150 Sanyo 195 modules, and 6 PVPowered 4800W inverters.

 

DOE-2 gives results with 20,600 kWh annual AC production using the standard model methodology.

 

PV Watts gives about 25,000 kWh annual AC production.  Solar designers in Portland support this higher value from actual building results.

 

Can anyone share experience with DOE-2 modeled PV output vs. PV Watts, or offer any suggestions on variables of primary concern in the DOE-2 input?

 

If anyone is truly expert on modeling solar PV in DOE-2, and can validate results with other calculation tools, I would be interested in hiring you for some limited consulting.

Hi, Bill,

 

My understanding agrees with Gail's.  I only need to mention one more
thing in your statement.  I do not think the Appendix G limits you to
use only one single packaged rooftop VAV system to do the job.  You may
use a few units of the same type based on the building situation, and
you are permitted to use a few constant flow roof tops if a certain
exception met.

Hi Bill,

 

Your interpretation is the correct interpretation.  This is specific to
Appendix G (the Performance Rating Method), and does not impact basic
code compliance (the Energy Cost Budget Method from Chapter 11).

 

I expect the change was made in order to encourage the selection of more
efficient system types for various buildings.  With the energy cost
budget method, buildings that select inherently efficient system types
are not credited for this selection because the Baseline case moves with
the Proposed case.  Similarly, buildings that select inherently

All,

I'm working on a LEED energy analysis for a small healthcare clinic
project (~15K sqft). According to A90.1-2004 Appendix G, Table G3.1.1A,
the baseline HVAC system for a nonresidential building with <=3 floors,
<75K sqft, and fossil fuel heating should be a packaged single zone
system with DX cooling and a gas-fired furnace for heating. This seems
like a big departure from the baseline system types indicated in the ECB
method. Is this a correct interpretation? If so, can anyone provide
feedback as to why this change was made?  It seems as though many
buildings of this size would utilize a packaged rooftop VAV. Also, it
potentially makes the number of systems necessary in the baseline
building significantly high unless the thermal blocks are simplified in
the proposed design model. 

Thanks,

There's an advanced simulation guidebook for modeling chiller curves on the
Energy Design Resources website.  It addresses a number of questions
regarding chiller curves in DOE-2.1 and DOE-2.2, particularly for chillers
having variable speed drives.

Folks:
 
eQuest (as did its predecessor DOE-2.1) use three basic curves to define chiller performance:
 
1)  EIR-FT

Takes the U-name of a curve that adjusts the electric input ratio as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the condenser temperature. This curve should be normalized to 1.0 at the ARI point (RATED-CHW-T, RATED-COND-T, etc.). 


2) EIR-FPLR


Takes the U-name of a curve that adjusts the electric input ratio as a function of

     The part load ratio (PLR) -  The PLR is defined as the ratio of the hourly load to the hourly capacity;  Load / Caphour

     The evaporator/condenser dT -  The temperature differential between the condenser and leaving chilled-water. The  meaning of the condenser temperature varies according to condenser type. 


3) CAPACITY-FT


Takes the U-name of a curve that adjusts the capacity of the chiller as a function of the leaving evaporator water temperature and the condenser temperature. This curve should be normalized to 1.0 at the rated conditions (RATED-CHW-T, RATED-COND-T, etc.).

MY understanding is the the EIR-FPLR was always to be the part load curve based on a constant condenser water entering temperature (say 85?F) and that the program would use the other two curves to modify this based on other chilled and condenser water conditions.

NOW I see a new equation (new to me) in eQuest that I can apparently put in the ARI curve of a chiller (based on ARI prescribed condenser water relief) and the program will accept that.

Is this anyone else's understanding?

Have you succeeded in getting a naturally ventilated building through
the USGBC with this method?
 
If so, I am sure all would be glad to hear it.

Ramana,
 
The ASHRAE 90.1 ECB sub-committee is working on a methodology for
simulating natural ventilation within the framework of Appendix G but I
don't think its finished yet.  In the meantime here is what I would
recommend.
 
Appendix G / 90.1 ECB allows you to use an exception calculation method
to simulate hybrid systems or unique efficiency measures to demonstrate
above-standard performance.  I think this would certainly apply in your
case.   
 
Here's what I have done on projects requiring an exception calculation
method.  
1. Establish your energy cost budget and your design energy case
following the Appendix G guidelines.  
2. Create a second model using the Design Energy Case as the baseline
and make the necessary modifications to simulate radiant heating / no
cooling via natural ventilation.  
3. Report the energy savings from your exception calculation as a line
item at the end of your LEED EA-1 summary table (similar to how
renewable energy is reported). 
4.  Include a seperate summary table  for the exception calculation
showing the energy end-use breakdown and how you arrived at the cost
savings.  Show both the baseline and proposed energy use.  
5. Make sure the savings are reasonable and prudent for the system you
are proposing.  
6. Document any changes to the model especially changes to schedules
that were necessary to properly simulate your system. 
7. Make it easy for someone to review your assumptions and the
methodology you used to estimate the savings
 
I hope this helps.  Good luck.

I am simulating a 28.1 kW array in DOE-2 (eQuest 3.6) and in PV Watts.  The
array is flat, on a rooftop with 150 Sanyo 195 modules, and 6 PVPowered
4800W inverters.

 

DOE-2 gives results with 20,600 kWh annual AC production using the standard
model methodology.

 

PV Watts gives about 25,000 kWh annual AC production.  Solar designers in
Portland support this higher value from actual building results.

 

Can anyone share experience with DOE-2 modeled PV output vs. PV Watts, or
offer any suggestions on variables of primary concern in the DOE-2 input?

 

If anyone is truly expert on modeling solar PV in DOE-2, and can validate
results with other calculation tools, I would be interested in hiring you
for some limited consulting.

Hi Ramana,

The ASHRAE Appendix G modeling protocol requires that both heating and
cooling be modeled for the entire building in both the Baseline and Proposed
design, even if no heating or cooling is included in the actual design (see
Appendix G, TableG3.1.10 (Proposed)).

According to Table G3.1.4 (Proposed), you may model the indoor fans in the
Proposed Design as cycling to show some benefit from natural ventilation,
while your budget case fans would be modeled as continuous during occupied
hours.  As far as I can tell, this is the only thing you can do to reflect
any energy savings from natural ventilation using the Appendix G modeling
methodology.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200612181035.AA3541843pd80001344050@gard.com>

2 part question - both regarding Humidity Control in eQUEST (v3.6):

1.

I'm trying to model dehumidification in a VAV system, and I keep getting
this error message:


 
**WARNING***************************************************************
*******
             ZONE East Perim Zn (T.E37)           
             might have insufficient heating capability.
             Check that the SYSTEM or ZONE HEATING-CAPACITY plus this
             ZONEs BASEBOARD-RATING is adequate to maintain the ZONE
             specified DESIGN-HEAT-T for the calculated peak ZONE load
             (see LS-A or LS-B for the ZONE peak load.)

             SYSTEM Sys1 (VAVS) (T)                 
             which supplies the above listed ZONE, has a design heating
             coil exit temperature, HEAT-SET-T,(plus any zone reheat)
             below its MAX-SUPPLY-T or the ZONE DESIGN-HEAT-T, which
             might account for the insufficient heating capability.

 
**WARNING***************************************************************
*******


I tried doubling the heating capacity, but it sends out the same
message. I have experimented with various systems, and it seems like the
only system I came across that does seem to be able to model this (or at
least shows a rise in energy usage) is the packaged single zone. (I am
thinking of using this instead since there is a VAV option with this).
Has anyone else run across this? The documentation says that the program
should do humidity control with the VAV system.


2. 

When I model the building with the packaged single zone system and
dehumidification, if I use the add on desiccant option (either liquid or
solid), I get a huge increase in heating energy. This seems
counterintuitive - I would assume there would be a reduction in heating
energy from the lack of reheat (there is some penalty associated with
recharging the desiccant, but that shouldn't outweigh the benefits of
reheat reduction).


Any guidance on this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Subject: [bldg-sim] eQUEST: ERROR MSG
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200612171958.AA5806812pd80001343739@gard.com>

Hello everyone,

I tried to create new Wall Construction in eQUEST. I first created 
materials, layers and then construction. However, I got some error messages 
and I tried to perform the simulation, but cannot be done.

ERROR MSGS:
- Layers
           Wall has no heat capacity. U-VALUE used!
- Construction
          EWall1 Cons Layers has no data due to previous error.


I only have the resistance value of those materials I want to use. Is it 
right that the U-value is automatically calculated based on the materials 
selections? So, when I create only such materials, with R-values only, I get 
errors. What should I do?

Does anyone know where I could get a list of insulation materials 
properties?


Many thanks in advance!

Mich

Tim,

The daylighting EEE really only works for a shoebox thermal zone. It 
tries it's best to subdivide E-10 thermal zones into 
cardinal-direction-facing lighting zones. If the thermal zone has a 
width of 0.0 then the daylighting EEE will not be able to figure out the 
correct geometry.  Can you tell me what the geometry of your model is?

I am attempting to do a daylighting EEE measure in Energy 10.

Does anyone know what it means when the program says: "Thermal Zone Width=
0.0!---Daylighting cannot be applied"???

Hi Virdi !
 
As per your comments you might be experiencing a problem with fan
schedules.
 
I found out is always recommended to enter the exhaust fan and min OA
schedules to have "control" of how much and when outside air is entering
into your spaces. A possible reason of why you are having negative
savings is because you entered the ERV fan schedules that is probably
bringing more outside air than the baseline design.
 
Please, if you have questions, let me know. Let me know if that was the
reason.
 
 
 
 
 
Thanks,

Hello all,
Anybody has experience with ERV in eQuest?
Does this application always generate saving?
I have the following data entered to the ERV:
Sensible ration is in the neighborhood of 75%
Latent ratio is also around 75%
The volume of exhaust air is 6750 cfm
Volume of fresh air is 6750 cfm
 
The result is generating cost than saving. Do you know what I should do
to correct this?
Thank you very much for the help.
 
Sincerely,
 
Virdi Permana

It sounds like your building's systems will actually be penalized for having
the central heat.  Your proposed system is technically classified as a
"Fossil/Electric Hybrid", which means that it should be modeled using System
7 (VAV with HW reheat).  This means that your building would show a lot
higher energy costs in the proposed design because of the electric reheat.

A possible work-around is to classify the central furnaces as preheat.  This
seems to conform to the intent of Appendix G, though it may not conform to
the exact wording.  According to G3.1.2.3, if the HVAC system in the
proposed design has a preheat coil, and a preheat coil can be modeled in the
baseline system, the baseline system shall be modeled with a preheat coil
controlled in the same manner as the proposed design.

I'm having some moral issues calculating LEED energy reduction points 
per 90.1 appendix G for a project, and I'm wondering if someone else has 
had the same issue......
This project has a packaged VAV with reheat system, with natural gas 
furnaces in roof top units, and electric reheat.  There's slightly more 
heating done by the electric reheat than centrally in this building.  
The way Appendix G reads, the Budget Building should have either all gas 
or all electric heat; all electric in this case (System 8).  Well, when 
I calculate energy savings relative to this Budget, the building is at 
about 20% energy cost reduction for 3 LEED points.  The savings are all 
from the central heating energy switch from electricity to gas, and is 
largely dependent on the cost of electricity relative to that of gas.  
It doesn't seem right to give this project such a high energy cost 
reduction, but I think this is what Appendix G is saying to do.  Anyone 
have any insight?  Is this addressed somewhere that I've missed?  I'm 
really wanting to put central gas furnaces in the Budget Building.....

Thanks for your help,
Aleka

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200612151241.AA4123218pd80001343116@gard.com>

Hello all:

 

First time poster.  I was referred by Aaron Dahlstrom at AFK Engineers.  

 

I am a new VisualDOE user and will be using the program primarily for energy
modeling for LEED purposes.  Our firm is based in San Diego, and we are
involved in several dozen California LEED projects.  As we get more requests
for work outside of California, we thought it would be beneficial to become
power users of energy modeling software other than EnergyPro.  I am very
experienced in using EnergyPro and I am very familiar with LEED (as I
mentioned, we have done energy modeling for dozens of California LEED
projects - everything from small schools to high-rise office towers,
Certified to Platinum).  

 

I did research on other DOE interfaces and decided that VisualDOE would be a
good place to start.  I am jumping right into a new construction project in
Seattle that is registered under LEED v2.2 (ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G
Baseline) and I am hoping to find support from other users who are using
VisualDOE for documenting LEED projects.  Hopefully I have come to the right
place.  Tianzhen has been very helpful in getting me started and I'm excited
to take a LEED seminar from archenergy when it is available in 2007.

 

Has anyone used VisualDOE for LEED documentation purposes?  Is anyone in
this group familiar with ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G (Performance Rating
Method)?  If so, I have some specific questions about how to best use the
software, and a general request for others' experiences in doing energy
modeling for LEED.

 

 

Thanks in advance!

 

 Charlie Christenson, LEED AP

Brandon,

In the detail mode, instead of creating a new space, add the doghouse to the space itself where you want to see the benefits of daylighting. Right click on the space, go to  'create child component' and then click on 'create exterior wall'.
Define the walls in the manner such that they sit on top of the roof of the space below. As the doghouse is not a separate space so there will be no floor or even a roof - it is a set of vertical walls with windows sitting on top of the space. 

You can do the same even in case of a space with a plenum. 



Best regards,

Gaurav Mehta

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQuest Clerestory Skylights


  All,

  Am looking for some insight into doing clerestory skylights with eQuest.  For clarification, clerestory skylights are essentially vertical windows, sitting in a "doghouse" if you will, on top of the space served.

  While it is interesting, I'm not sure I fully understand what eQuest is doing what it adds horizontal skylights in the wizards.  Evidently if the space served has a plenum, a "dummy" roof needs to be defined for the actual occupied space, else skylights will illuminate the plenum.  Turning these Wizard-inserted horizontal skylights into the clerestory types mentioned above I have reservations attempting in the detailed editor.  

  But what if there is no plenum?  While in the detailed editor I would like to add the simple doghouse shells with side-windows and a floor of "air", then cut away the roof of the space it sits atop of and enjoy daylighting calculations -- but something tells me the space below may not receive the benefit of the daylighting... that perhaps the daylighting will be applied only to the space within the doghouse and not transmitted to the space below, regardless of the fact that the floor is "air" and there is no ceiling in-between.  

  Does anyone know if these concerns are valid, or perhaps of another approach for modeling the aforementioned clerestory type skylights?  One thought that comes to mind is to simply take the Wizard-inserted horizontal skylights and rotate them 90?, but I am unclear about what other measures would need to be taken to assure accuracy.

Micha,

A different SIM file is created for each parametric run, so check your
project folders for more than one SIM file. The yellow striped reports
should have more than your baseline if the simulation of your parametric
runs went through.

What you create in the wizard and what you do with it in the detailed
interface can be completely different things. Including walls,
windows/glazing, HVAC systems etc. You don't have to create everything in
the wizard, the wizard is just to get you started. To make a new wall
(layered), you have to create materials first, layers next and constructions
in the end. Or you can override the layers of existing wall by giving it a U
value which then disregards the actual R value created by the layers. I
would personally suggest creating layers rather than modifying the U value.

And finally I think you are confusing conductance and conductivity, if I
recollect correctly, conductivity is independent of the thickness.

Ramana.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200612132023.AA2323890pd80001342273@gard.com>

Hello there,

I have a problem with creating Parametric Runs Reports, (in eQUEST); I used 
Schematic Wizard first and then went to do the Parametric Runs. I did that 
successfully, or supposedly successful. And when I check the summary 
results, I only got 1 type of summary report! No Parametric Reports!

Is there anything wrong I did?

Is it also possible to change the wall construction materials completely? By 
only adding the resistance value, after creating a material from scratch. I 
tried to change the whole wall materials that were already set via the 
Wizard, and then I got errors and the simulation could not carry on 
performing. Is there any way to include new materials within the Wizard?

Finally, I just want to make sure about something; The thermal conductivity 
has a unit of [Btu in/h-ft^2-F], but in the eQUEST, its as [Btu/h-ft-F]

Your help and advice will be much appreciated!

Thank you..

Micha radi

Subject: [bldg-sim] How to edit the contents of the eQuest Project/Runs list?
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200612131518.AA1849906pd80001342111@gard.com>


The list is populated by the simulation results that are contained in
the "Projects" folder of your eQuest program directory.

If you want to remove some items from showing up, then you should make a
new folder (I use "Projects Archive") in the eQuest directory and move
the unused files to that folder.

Also if you are using eQuest on a project stored on a network folder,
the results viewer will show the results for all projects in the
"Projects" folder of eQuest along with all of the results that are in
the folder for the currently active project.

Alternately you could delete all of the files except for the *.inp and
*.pd2 for that particular project name and the results would go away,
but you would still have the input files in the same folder, you'd have
to re-simulate the files if you needed the results again.

Hope this helps!

Hi Bill,

Your interpretation is the correct interpretation.  This is specific to
Appendix G (the Performance Rating Method), and does not impact basic code
compliance (the Energy Cost Budget Method from Chapter 11).

I expect the change was made in order to encourage the selection of more
efficient system types for various buildings.  With the energy cost budget
method, buildings that select inherently efficient system types are not
credited for this selection because the Baseline case moves with the
Proposed case.  Similarly, buildings that select inherently inefficient
system types are not penalized for this selection.  Appendix G attempts to
correct this by

You are correct that the number of systems modeled in the baseline building
may be high.

All,
I'm working on a LEED energy analysis for a small healthcare clinic
project (~15K sqft). According to A90.1-2004 Appendix G, Table G3.1.1A, 
the baseline HVAC system for a nonresidential building with <=3 floors,
<75K sqft, and fossil fuel heating should be a packaged single zone
system with DX cooling and a gas-fired furnace for heating. This seems
like a big departure from the baseline system types indicated in the ECB
method. Is this a correct interpretation? If so, can anyone provide
feedback as to why this change was made?  It seems as though many
buildings of this size would utilize a packaged rooftop VAV. Also, it
potentially makes the number of systems necessary in the baseline
building significantly high unless the thermal blocks are simplified in

My understanding is that in App-G, the baseline
building fan power is calculated out from section
G3.1.2.9, while the proposed building will have the
actual designed fan power. Hence, the baseline
building and proposed building can have different fan
powers and thus, credit is given to good duct design.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200612101034.AA3442437pd80001340556@gard.com>

Varkie, what we typically do is calculate the projected temperature
profiles using the ESHG method, then insert the return temperature from
the ESHG calc as the space operating temperature. This way the
underfloor supply CFM is only for the load it 'sees'. Look at the system
pressure drops carefully and amend  the fan pressure accordingly. Make
sure the systems have perimeter heating. Depending upon your location
you are right in checking the AHU to see if it dehumidifies the supply
and doesn't simply provide air at 63F. Another way we check this is to
run the same model but this time with 55F and the same delta T as the
underfloor model, checking the latent loads between these models will
give an indication of the dehumidification been carried in the model.

 

Good luck.

The baseline System No. is 8 - VAV w/PFP Boxes).  The proposed is also
PIU (DOE2).  The perimeter zones up to 3 ft are served from the ceiling.


The remaining interior zones have UFAD.  The CHW coil leaving temp of
the primary air is 48F.  The UFAD supply temp is 65 F.  The ceiling
return air temp is 78.  The System MIN-SUPPLY-T = 65 and COOL-SET-T =
48.  ZONE-FAN-RATIO = 1.74 ??    80% glass.

The Baseline primary air is 53F and ceiling supply is 55F.  The ceiling
return air temp is 76.  System MIN-SUPPLY-T = 55 and COOL-SET-T = 53.
ZONE-FAN-RATIO = 1.1.  40% glass.

Is all this correct?  Increasing the ZFR increases the Fan energy.
Increasing the MIN-SUPPLY-T from 55F to 65F increased the System Supply
Air and Fan energy considerably.

For UFAD is it acceptable to assume the following space volume temps?

$ Baseline Summer & Winter Space Volume Temp = 75 $

 

$ UFAD: 75F from 0' to 7' 85F from 7.1' to 10' Avg Summer Space Temp =
78F $

$ UFAD:  75F from 0' to 7' 65F from 7.1' to 10' Avg Winter Space Temp =
72F $

STD62.1-2004 Table 6-2 'Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness (Ez)' shows

Ez = 1.0 for Ceiling Supply of Cool Air

Ez = 1.2 for Floor Supply of Cool Air and Ceiling Return.

How would you apply this in DOE2.1E for Under-floor Air Distribution?

How is occupancy based lighting modeled?  Based on 10CFR435 Table
401.3.3.  Lighting Schedule = Max Design Lighting * Base Lighting
Schedule * 0.7 ?

How is occupancy based ventilation modeled? Percent Outdoor Air for Hour
= Maximum Design Percent Outdoor Air * Occupancy Schedule Fraction.
Apply this schedule in MIN-AIR-SCH ?

Varkie. 

This issue was discussed at length at the Fri meeting of the 90.1 ECB subcommittee in Quebec City. You can find a write-up on the ECB website. 

Long story short, a method has been proposed with EQUEST that is being tested by LBL. When/if they finish the report, then I think you'll be able to use this for a UFAD, with limitations, of course.

I think you have got it, the ECB Chapter 11 for code compliance, says to
use the same kW/cfm in both models, with an upper limit on the baseline
building fan system's power consumption.

If you are performing a LEED EAC1 calculation (or other performance
rating), Appendix G will use the baseline model fan system at the power
consumption limit regardless of the design system using more or less
power.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200612080755.AA5515703pd80001339824@gard.com>

  Hello, everyone,
    Could anybody share experiences on using Energyplus to model supermarket energy systems? How is it? 
    Regarding this ability, is there any comparison between Energyplus with eQuest refrigeration version (DOE2.2) and SST from EPRI? Right now, I am using eQuest-R and SST to do benchmarking.
      Recently, I was told that latest version Energyplus has the ability to simulate supermarket energy systems. I am wondering whether Energplus can model different refrigeration systems (central rack, distributed system, secondary loop), display cases and walking-in cooler/freezer, impact of indoor humidity, integration of refrigeration and HVAC system, different control strategies, TEWI.
    Thanks,
    Zheng

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200612070945.AA4533468pd80001339389@gard.com>

Dear all,

I am modeling an operations facility in eQUEST with a few spaces that
require heating with no cooling and are naturally ventilated (for Eugene
Climate).

I assigned these spaces to the system type Heating/Ventilating Sys with the
code-word HVSYS. Regarding modeling natural ventilation, eQUEST tutorial
says "natural ventilation is available in eQUEST via the detailed interface,
only for single duct DX systems. The calculation uses Sherman-Grimsrud
algorithm."

I am not aware if the Sherman-Grimsrud method is relevant to the kind of
system I'm using, and this would be my first time to use it if I did. The
BEPS report shows 98.3% of the times, systems zones are outside the
throttling range. In the SS-R report, all the problematic zones listed are
the same ones that use the HVSYS system. (None of the other zones that use
Chilled water and hot water coils are listed in the SS-R).

Any ideas on how the zones in question can be modeled to account for natural
ventilation and Heating with no cooling? If relevant, how does the
Sherman-Grimsrud method work in eQUEST?

Thank you,

Hello all,

Anybody has experience with ERV in eQuest?

Does this application always generate saving?

I have the following data entered to the ERV:

Sensible ration is in the neighborhood of 75%

Latent ratio is also around 75%

The volume of exhaust air is 6750 cfm

Volume of fresh air is 6750 cfm

 

The result is generating cost than saving. Do you know what I should do to
correct this?

Thank you very much for the help.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200612061150.AA5005328pd80001338887@gard.com>

Good afternoon Everyone,

 

Last night, I encountered two eQuest errors I've never seen before.  My
project uses a chiller and boiler with 5 main VAV/reheat AHUs for large main
areas and about 25 fan-coil units for individual smaller areas.  Four of the
5 AHUs have enthalpy wheel heat recovery.  There are also 4 ERVs to supply
tempered OA to the fan coils.  I was troubleshooting for too many hours
outside throttling range when the first error occurred (v3.6):

 

1.	When checking the reports, I noticed "-nan" in the BEPS, BEPU & ES-D
reports in the miscellaneous equipment and space cooling electric columns.
At first I assumed that there was an error that caused excessive electric
use for those categories.  However, I removed ALL miscellaneous equipment
loads and schedules from the entire project, reran the simulation and still
had the "-nan" in the reports in both the miscellaneous equipment and space
cooling electric columns.  I re-entered my data and again saw no change in
the sim reports.  It finally disappeared when I saved the project as a new
file and reran.  Any ideas?

 

2.	The second error occurred when I tried to add DCV to AHU-3.  I
thought the simulation ran fine.  However, when checking the reports, I
noticed that both space cooling and domestic hot water use completely
disappeared - not even zeros in the BEPS report columns.  I reran the
simulation and ended up with 0's for both categories.  When I removed the
DCV, both categories came back.  What does domestic hot water use have to do
with DCV in an Auditorium????  Again, any ideas?

 

Thanks and have a nice day.

Thank you for your response.
  However, the PIU option is given only for cooling option set at chilled water coils.
  As per ASHRAE I have to model this system with cooling option set at DX coils.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Modeling Packaged VAV system with PFP Boxes


  
  I was comparing a proposed design system to a base-case system specified in ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G using EQUEST. This base case system is a Packaged VAV system with Parallel Fan Powered Boxes. On examining the DX options given in the EQUEST system menu, the closest I could get is 'Packaged VAV with Reheat'. On switching to detailed mode the option for zone fans is deactivated.
  Could anybody give any suggestions as to how I can model this Packaged VAV with PFP boxes? 
  Any help is greatly appreciated.
  Thanks

I had seen a suggestion to develop an equivalent air-cooled chiller to
the DX system, with pumping energy set to zero, and then using the VAV
w/ PFPB as normal.

I was in the midst of trying this myself when my proposed project was
modified to be a standard VAV system and so I can't report that it did
or didn't work satisfactorily.  I didn't get to the point of developing
curves for the equivalent chiller.

Hope this helps!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200612041614.AA1444140pd80001337903@gard.com>

Hi !
 
I am using eQuest to do Building Energy Simulation for existing buildings in order to predict savings on ECM's.
I have eQuest 3.6 and I would like to know if any of you knows how to create a parametric component on eQuest in order to simulate Trombe walls.
 
Any help, there??
 
Thanks,
Mario

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200612041146.AA4605625pd80001337760@gard.com>

Hello All,

I am trying to incorporate ERV to our model. Can please anyone tell me how I
can get the following values and what the common values are:

1. Sensible Effectiveness Ratio

2. Latent Effectiveness Ratio

3. Fraction Latent HX Resistance due to Air Films

4. Exponent Varying Latent Air Film Resistance

5. Design Outdoor and Exhaust Air flow

 

Also, does the used of ERV always give saving in the simulation?

Thank you.

 

Sincerely,

 

Virdi Permana

They don't come back if you close and restart?

Also are the files in the right directory?  If you have a file open on a

another folder.  Reports for projects in the eQuest/projects directory
should always be visible of course.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200612011453.AA534993pd80001336866@gard.com>

All,
 
In attempting to upgrade the version 3.57 on my laptop to version 3.60
(which I have done on my desktop machine without a hitch), I receive an
"Internal Failure" dialog box with error number 0x80040707 and no
description.  The dialog box repeats after clicking OK, and then the
licensing agreement dialog appears, curiously with no licensing
agreement displayed in the box.  
 
Agreeing to the license next shows the "Choose Destination Location"
dialog, and everything appears good to go despite the warnings when on
the next screen "eQUEST 3-6" may be selected as the program folder.
 
Subsequently clicking on "Next" however results in a dialog box entitled
"Component transfer error" with the statement "unknown error" shown.
Clicking on OK in this box terminates the installer.
 
I next attempt to remove version 3.57, but the installer terminates with
the same error number.  
 
 
Does anyone have any ideas on what might be the problem, or what to do
next?
 
 
 
Thanks

Are the reports in the .INP file being called out?

I'm able to open the SIM file, and the BEPS & BEPU reports seem to be in
order. I'm just curious about the reports in eQUEST though.

Are you sure there isn't a run error within the simulation itself? There
should be a .SIM file you can view through the "back door", and see if
something didn't compute.I have had similar situation, and a run error
within the simulation didn't spit out into the eQuest interface. Not all
errors show up in eQuest.

I recently downloaded eQUEST v3.6 build 5200, and after running a
simulation on it, I am unable to review any of the simulation results in
eQUEST (the eQUEST post simulation reports all show up blank). 

Has anyone else has had similar problems? If so - is there a fix and
what is it? 

Thanks

I've had this problem before as well.  Try opening the sim file from the
project directory in a text editor.  Many times the data is there but
for one reason or another it won't open in eQUEST's viewer.
