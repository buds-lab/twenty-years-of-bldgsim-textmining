You could also create your own BIN data from TMY or
WYEC2 files using Excel. Just manipulate the data and
you can create whatever you want. the advantage of
this is that you can break the data up by time of day,
and also use whatever bin size you like.

You can get TMY data free at:

http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/tmy2/State.html

Or there's lots of places to get TMY/WYEC2 data for a
fee (ie. Ashrae)

For recent (specific year) data you could try the
University of Dayton site. This is just daily average
temp, but is complete from 1995 to today. You could
use it to compare/adjust BIN data:

We are looking at energy costs for residential applications in the Omaha,
NE
area.

We are using both Degree Day Method and BIN Method for approximating energy
consumption.

Degree Day data is easy to find off of the web. However, BIN Data is much
more difficult. What are good sources of BIN Data?

Prefer free sources, but would be willing to pay. Can this data be obtained
based on yearly totals? Recent years are preferred.

Thank you in Advance,

I am modeling a building in DOE2.1e using the add on solid desiccant
dehumidification option.

How do I determine what the part load performance curves that the program is

gas use and auxiliary kW] are obtained from subroutines containing hardwired
curves."

Does this mean the curves for this equipment are not changeable?  Do they
reflect actual system operation?

Dominique,

The issue of refrigerated cased in supermarkets is messy. Physically, the
net total and sensible cooling effect on the supermarket zone (sometimes
called the "case credit") are driven by heat and mass transfer from the case
itself, and therefore is dependent on store temperature and humidity. Cases
are typically rated at 75 F and 55% RH store conditions, but the latent
cooling effect of the cases is particularly sensitive to indoor humidity.
The sensitivity is different for low-temperature and medium temperature
cases. However, most of the models calculate the cooling effect as the
difference between the average compressor load and the internal case heat
gains, including fans, lights, and anti-sweat heaters. Depending on case
design, these heat gains can be surprisingly large. In addition, the
compressor capacity will naturally be oversized to account for product
pull-down.

I would suggest two sources of info. First, ASHRAE sponsored Research
Project 596-RP Effects of Indoor Space Conditions on Refrigerated Display
Case Performance. The work was completed by Ron Howell in 1991. I expect
that the final report can be obtained directly from Bill Seaton at ASHRAE.
Second, EPRI has done quite a bit of work in this area. They have also
developed a computer program call SST - Supermarket Simulation Tool.
However, you may have difficulty obtaining the reports if you are not
affiliated with an EPRI member.

Good luck,

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] DOE2.1E Heat recovery question


>From the DOE2.1E Supplement:

REFG-ZONE-LOAD	is the total cooling effect...

			Manufacturers of supermarket cases usually do not
list the
			total cooling effect of their cases directly.
Instead, they list the
			compressor capacity at a standard suction
temperature
			required per lineal foot of case work. The sensible
cooling effect
			is typically 65% of this number, and the latent
cooling effect is
			about 10%. The total cooling effect is then about
75% of the
			listed compressor capacity per lineal foot,
multiplied by the
			lineal feet of case work.

Does this mean that 75% of the compressor's cooling capacity cools the zone?
Where does the other 25% disappear to?
Do these figures vary depending on ambient conditions?
Are there any references for these numbers (ASHRAE or otherwise)?

Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

Dominique:

I have a response but note that my response is *speculation*, but here goes.

My guess is that the difference between compressor load and total cooling effect
is actually the difference between evaporator load and total case load per
hour.  When I was in refrigeration school, over two decades ago, I was taught to
size the refrigerated case evaporator so that the daily heat gain can be met by
16 hours of evaporator run time per 24 hours.  The reason for this was to allow
sufficient time for off cycle defrost.  Have not kept up with modern
refrigerated display cases, so do not know if the schooled methodology is still
appropriate.

This brings up an important air conditioning sizing issue for supermarkets.
ASHRAE recommends HVAC designers take into account the heat absorbed by
refrigerated display cases when running heat gain/loss calcs.  Unfortunately,
ASHRAE offers no guidance for imperical hourly heat absorption by the display
case verses the evaporator load.

For a recent supermarket commissioning project, the HVAC designer assumed 16
hr/day evaporator sizing, thus the heat absorbed from the space was 2/3 of the
scheduled evaporated loads.  This was further multiplied by another fudge
factor, since the designer was hesitant to assume net heat absorption to space
as 2/3 of scheduled evaporator load, which seems reasonable to me.

Hope this helps.

Hi,
  I am simulating a 14 storey office building as a
case study for my reasearch. The building has more
than 70% glass. Can anyone send me a sample glass
building simulated in DOE.

Thanks

I happened to be at the Building Energy Software Tools Directory 
today and noticed that DOE-2, Trace and HAP have about 8,000 
users all together.  The BLDG-SIM mailing list goes out to 350 
people.  That is only 4%!  That means that 96% of the users may 
still have questions about where to get weather data files or how 
to simulate something unusual in DOE-2.  Can we try to help these 
poor people out?   The first step is to let them know about the 
BLDG-SIM mailing list.  If you know of other people that use 
building energy simulation software, could you please e-mail them 
and tell them about the mailing list.  The description of the 
mailing list from the web site is shown at the end of the e-mail.

Thanks for spreading the word,

Jason

---------------------------------------------- 

BLDG-SIM is a mailing list for users of building energy 
simulation programs. Building energy simulation programs allow 
users to estimate the energy use and operating cost of 
residential, commercial and other types of buildings. This allows 
engineers, architects and others in the building design trade to 
compare alternative designs and select the design that is cost 
justified. They are frequently used during the design process 
when choosing between alternatives in the components that make up 
a building including insulation level, heating and cooling 
distribution systems, furnaces, boilers and air conditioning 
equipment. The web page for this mailing list is located at:  

http://www.gard.com/ml/bldg-sim.htm

Examples of building simulation programs include DOE-2, Trace-
600, HAP, Blast, ESP, SERIRES, TRNSYS, TASE, Energy-10, and 
others (see link below for a more complete list).  

http://www.eren.doe.gov/buildings/tools_directory/

Since the users of building energy simulation programs are spread 
across the world, this mailing list is an attempt to foster the 
development of a community of those users. Experienced and 
inexperienced users of building energy simulation programs are 
welcome and are expected to share their questions and insights  
about these programs.

Hi Bruce and all, 

I wrote a FREE windows program using Visual Basic that might help.  This 
allows you to make bin data for any of the 239 US cities where TMY2 data 
was collected and published by the US government. 

Download the self extracting zip file by entering this URL:  

   http://www.hvacware.net/free-bin.exe 

There is no link from my site to this program.  You must type the above 
URL to start the download.  So far, this is an exclusive offer to members of 
this list.  After I make a few more improvements, I will make it available to 
the public.  Some people took a copy of this program last month when I 
announced it on this list.  Those of you who gave me feedback...I 
appreciate your input.  

If you took a copy last month, you might want to upgrade to this version...it 
breaks down temperature bins by month and also includes the source 
code.  It also fixes a problem where reading the TMY2 data file from a 
network drive was VERY slow.  This program is written in Visual Basic 6.  
The VB6 source is included with the program in case you want to modify it 
to suit your needs.  I only ask that this software not be used in any 
commercial software sold for profit. 

This program converts TMY2 weather files to bin weather data for quick 
energy calulations.  The bin data is stored in .CSV files that can be opened 
directly by Excel or just about any other spreadsheet.  It considers the dry 
bulb temperature only. And currently, only US imperial units. Your can 
choose to create 2 degree, 4 degree, 5 degree, or 10 degree temperature 
bins.   

TMY2 weather data files are available for free on the Internet.  See the 
README.TXT file for details.

We want to start simulations with Vis Doe in the BELGIAN

We have the TRY file for Uccle (Belgium)

We tried several ways get the correct weather format for Doe but 
the conversion allways fails in a floating point error !

After having asked Eley about this, we did not recieve a conclusive 
answer

does somebody have an idea ?
Or does somebody have a weather file for DOE for BELGIUM

Hello All,
	I wanted to represent the minority of people who subscribe to this mailing list and who aren't DOE-2 users (our company primarily uses TRNSYS). I think that this forum lends itself well to all of us getting to know more about the capabilities of the simulation programs that we don't use regularly. The more people who subscribe the better!
Cheers,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200108301623.AA230581pd80000072765@gard.com>


I have a DOE question for you.  If I wanted to simulate the energy
consumption of a building that have negative process load, could I input a
negative process load to be considered in the buildings load calc?  Maybe
there is a way to create a lighting system with negative wattage that
operates 24 hours per day or what ever the equivalent of the process load
is.

I am asking because I am trying to simulate a supermarket which has reduced
cooling load because the refrigeration systems provide cooling that is not
seen by the HVAC system.

Anyway, let me know what you think.

DOE-2 has refrigerated case equipment models which will do just what 
you want.  You specify a nominal sensible and latent load for up to 
three different types of cases (each type can have a different 
setpoint and compressor efficiency) and the loads are adjusted as the 
temperature and humidity change in the space.  You can also specify 
auxiliaries and defrost controls.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Testers Wanted for Simulation Screening Tool
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200108311356.AA562031pd80000073081@gard.com>

BLDG-SIM List Members,

Today marks the beginning of the beta test of DoeRayMe, a 
new screening tool application using DOE-2.1e that I have 
developed.  All are welcome to join this public beta of the 
DoeRayMe software.   

DoeRayMe is a simple and flexible user interface for the 
building energy simulation program called DOE-2.  It is 
intended to be used as a user interface for many "screening 
tool" applications.  DoeRayMe may be used by inexperienced 
as well as experienced DOE-2 users.  

Some prerequisites for testing DoeRayMe:  

 1) You must already have the DOE-2.1e software program to
    run this program.

 2) You should have at least 30 minutes to spend testing
    the software.

To find out more about the beta test and download the beta 
software go to:

 http://www.gard.com/DoeRayMe/

DoeRayMe is an open source program covered by the license 
based on the Mozilla Public License. 

Thanks

Jason
