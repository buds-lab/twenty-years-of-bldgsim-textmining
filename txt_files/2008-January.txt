Subject: [Bldg-sim] heating and cooling capacity inconsistency
Message-ID: <cdf76d820801020808x45b082beodf0f2910671332dd@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to document the predicted energy performance of a 26000
ft2 christian life program building that would serve poor and
homeless. It's near 100% construction and the eQUEST energy model
results give me the following warning messages. The cooling and
heating capacities entered were directly taken from HVAC equipment
manufacturer's submittal. Is there an explanation for this or am I not
doing something right?

It looks to me like you can change the order of the runs by changing the
label number in the parametric run definitions window.  The label number
corresponds to the order in which the runs are performed.

Does anyone know to which file information about parametric runs defined
within eQuest are written?  I'm trying to change the order of runs I
described, and I can't seem to find it anywhere.  Maybe a better
question
is: is it possible to change the order of parametric runs?

Message-ID: <000901c84d6d$44b425d0$7301a8c0@rushingreed>

Hi all,

 

I'm working on an energy model for a project that is very interested in
incorporating a mixed mode ventilation scheme.  The mixed mode would
operate in an on/off red light green light method where the mechanical
cooling would shut down during hours when the outdoor air temperature
could meet the space cooling loads and the mechanical system would run its
relief fan in order to pull air into the space.  It would be up to the
occupants to open the operable windows.  

 

I've been through the basic options for natural ventilation in eQUEST and
it doesn't look like what's available in eQUEST is going to work for the
PIU system I have in the building right now. I'm thinking it will have to
involve some sort of schedule modification to turn off the perimeter VAV
box fans during hours when the loads could be met by the natural
ventilation.  I could make the schedule based on BIN calc information for
Seattle.  This would involve a lot of fine tuning though and it would be
questionable whether I could still keep the unmet load hours under 300.
To simulate the operable windows modifications could be made to the
infiltration values at the perimeter spaces.

 

If anyone has had any success with mixed mode ventilation or has any ideas
towards this it would be much appreciated.

Robby,
 
If your project is seeking LEED certification and you want to claim credit
for the Natural Ventilation under EA-1, I reccomend that you get the book
"Natural ventilation in non-domestic buildings" published by the CIBSE and
the Carbon Trust.  USGBC requires a rigourous analysis of your natural
ventilation modeling results before granting any EA-1 credit and this
reference will help you navigate that.  You should also read the CIR
regarding natural ventilation energy savings on the USGBC website.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] IES/VE MicroFlo CFD: Unbalanced Flow
Message-ID: <da943e850801021404y4253f608ydc09a0da508b8110@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am modeling a large welcome gallery of a museum using IES/VE v5.8.1.

When I try to run the MicroFlo CFD simulation (after running Suncast,
Apache, i.e. following all the steps required before running a CFD
simulation in IES), I get a 'Unbalanced Flow' prompt that gives a
subtraction of two cfm numbers and it states that 'in-flow and out-flow must
balance'.

This happens before IES runs any CFD simulation. I tried to change the
number of operable windows both in lower levels and higher levels of the
space and every such change results in different cfm numbers being
subtracted in the prompt and it does not run any simulation.

The space I am trying to analyze is conical in shape with the height of ~50
ft (15.24 m) and has a base of 64 ft (19.5 m) diameter. I modeled this space
first as 3 different spaces- the bottom being the widest and it becomes
narrower as it goes higher and then I used the 'connect spaces' command to
connect the three spaces without any partitions.

Any thoughts on what's causing the unbalanced flow? and how can it be
corrected? Is it due to the grid settings? I am just making a trial run and
have not yet detailed the model much and left almost everything to default.



Best regards,

Gaurav

Message-ID: <00c901c84d95$5a172030$0e456090$@com>

Hello All,

 

My first post to bldg-sim, I have learned a great deal from your emails.

 

I am trying to wrap up an eQuest model of a school that is using water
source heat pumps (located in Georgia).  The building is connecting to a
campus condenser water loop, so there is no heat rejection system that is
actually part of the project, but I have to include something in eQuest,
which I have modeled as a cooling tower and variable speed pump.

 

I am running in to issues with no heating or cooling energy being reported
in the BEPS report, and 94% of hours outside throttling range.  I have tried
several different types of HVAC systems (pkgd single zone, water loop HP,
pkgd var vol var temp) all with condenser type as ?water cooled? (except for
water loop hp which doesn?t allow you to pick a condenser type).  I have set
my circulation loop for condenser water to loop type ?condenser water? and
also tried loop type ?Water Loop HP? which no success.  When I use ?Water
Loop HP? I get an error message ?Loop: WLHP water loop has no primary
heating equipment.?

 

On my HVAC systems ?heating ? coil capacity? display I have heat source set
to ?heat pump? and zone heat source as ?not installed?

 

Any ideas?  A bad combination of system type and heat rejection maybe? I
have tried all combinations that I can think of.

 

Thanks for taking a look,

 

Mike Gutowski, PE

Message-ID: <002d01c84e1a$b9696ef0$2301a8c0@Alec>

Hi,

I am modeling a high-bay warehouse with 53' ceiling height.  Looking in
table 9.6 of 90.1-2004, the allowable LPD for a "medium / bulky" warehouse
is 0.9 W/sf.  However, there is no distinction made for ceiling height, as
there is for the manufacturing category, which differentiates between
high-bay and low-bay.  

When modeling to demonstrate compliance with 90.1, is there any allowance
for a higher LPD in a high-bay warehouse location?

 

Thanks!

Does Table G3.1.2.9 apply to stand-alone exhaust fans?  It seems that when
having a VAV system type the baseline exhaust fan power is a lot more then
the proposed design, and a baseline exhaust fan power calculated using the
constant volume calc gives a more reasonable baseline.  Any thoughts?

I agree with Jeff.
Different programs may produce different energy savings results for USGBC LEED certification, depending on (a) the competence level of the program user, (b) the technical in-depth knowledge they have of this subject, (c) their experience in developing real buildings, (d) the design criteria that they use and (e) how well they understand the program they are using.  
Theoretically all programs should produce the same results for a given project if the inputs are identical and the programs use the same methods-equations for analyzing envelopes, systems and plants.  EnergyPlus uses the Heat-Balance method for Loads whereas all the other programs use the Transfer-Function method.  Systems & Plants depend on the performance curves of the equipment.  
Decisions have to take into account first & maintenance costs, availability of equipment parts and maintenance staff, reliability and durability of systems, positive environmental and acoustic impacts, and client preferences.  This requires experience working on real buildings.  A mechanical engineering degree and P.E. are more suitable qualifications for energy analysts than LEED A.P.
The ?percent energy savings? requirement of LEED can be misleading since it is affected by different design criteria, process loads, internal loads schedules (these items have to be the same in the baseline and proposed models) and the program used.  The higher the common items in the baseline and proposed, the lower the ?percent? energy saved.  Sixty percent energy savings does not necessarily mean an optimally designed, long lasting, stable and cost-effective building at the given (particularly urban) location.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest modeling water-source heat pumps



Hello All,

 

My first post to bldg-sim, I have learned a great deal from your emails.

 

I am trying to wrap up an eQuest model of a school that is using water
source heat pumps (located in Georgia).  The building is connecting to a
campus condenser water loop, so there is no heat rejection system that
is actually part of the project, but I have to include something in
eQuest, which I have modeled as a cooling tower and variable speed pump.

 

I am running in to issues with no heating or cooling energy being
reported in the BEPS report, and 94% of hours outside throttling range.
I have tried several different types of HVAC systems (pkgd single zone,
water loop HP, pkgd var vol var temp) all with condenser type as "water
cooled" (except for water loop hp which doesn't allow you to pick a
condenser type).  I have set my circulation loop for condenser water to
loop type "condenser water" and also tried loop type "Water Loop HP"
which no success.  When I use "Water Loop HP" I get an error message
"Loop: WLHP water loop has no primary heating equipment."

 

On my HVAC systems "heating - coil capacity" display I have heat source
set to "heat pump" and zone heat source as "not installed"

 

Any ideas?  A bad combination of system type and heat rejection maybe? I
have tried all combinations that I can think of.

 

Thanks for taking a look,

 

Mike Gutowski, PE

Green Building Studio will run very basic energy calculations using the
gbXML format, but also has the ability to export to both the energyplus
file format and the DOE-2 file format. However, I am not aware of any
software that will directly convert to an *.inp file format.

For gbXML to eQuest, check out www.greenbuildingstudio.com ...
 
You can import the gbXML into GBS, then save as DOE-2 file.  However,
this DOE-2 file cannot be edited with eQuest wizards.  You'll need to do
all editing going forward in the detailed interface.  If you've not done
any projects yet with eQuest, there IS a learning curve that seems to
vary inversely with the cube of your overall level of computing
expertise ;-)  
 
So if the project is coming from Revit, be sure to check out IES
<http://www.iesve.com/content/default.asp?page=s97_1> .  Despite the
relatively spendy price tag, you may be time and money ahead in the race
to obtain meaningful results.

Hello Again,

Thank you all for your responses! Per all of your instructions I registered with www.greenbuildingstudio.com<http://www.greenbuildingstudio.com/> and attempted to use their services to create an Equest type *.BDL or *.INP file from the gbXML file I was emailed.

When I attempted to upload the *.XML file using the Green Building Studio Client I was given an error that said:

 "File does not have a valid five digit zip code."

So I opened the *.XML file with an editor and added the project zip code and saved it with a new name.  Then I tried uploading it again via the Green Building Studio Client and I was presented with this next error:

"File received does not have any building area defined. This is an essential requirement."

Similarly, as I am also an experienced HAP V4.31 user I tried importing the *.XML file into HAP which gave me the following error:

"Data from the specified gbXML file could not be imported. Usually this is due to one of the following problems: (1) the file does not contain XML, (2) the file is not formatted according to the gbXML schema, or (3) the file cannot be found."

Of those three options I am assuming the problem is the wrong schema (2), as I know the file contains *.XML of some sort, and I do know where it is.

The architect with whom I am in collaboration used the File Menu pulldown option in Revit to "Export to gbXML" and then they emailed me the *.XML file that export command generated.  Is there something that can be down to verify the file is: (1) in the right schema, (2) has been exported properly, (3) contains the information appropriate for Equest and/or HAP imports?

When I view the *.XML file I was emailed in my text editor it has only a bunch of 'surfaces' defined, 1,025 to be exact, it seems to me like there needs to be more in a gbXML file to perform and energy model than just 'surface' polygon definitions.  Is this Architect providing me with an appropriate file, are there other ways to achieve better interoperability between his architectural needs and my energy analysis needs?

Thank you for all of your continued assistance.

Sincerely,
Josh

Josh,

 

You said, "Is this Architect providing me with an appropriate file, are
there other ways to achieve better interoperability between his
architectural needs and my energy analysis needs?"

 

If you search onebuilding listserv archives
http://lists.onebuilding.org/mmsearch.cgi/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org using
"Revit" there are 10 responses.  

 

There is an email where I put in a few links related to Revit, IES, gbXML,
etc.
http://lists.onebuilding.org/htdig.cgi/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2007-Decembe
r/006503.html 

 

One of the links speaks to your question regarding interoperability in that,
yes, there are certain items that need to be correctly modeled or included
in the model for energy analysis that are noted in the following paper:
Building Performance Analysis Using Revit at
http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/building_performance_analysis_using_re
vit.pdf   

 

I don't have direct experience using Revit for energy modeling.  We recently
started using Revit Architecture and I've started down the path looking into
how energy modeling relates to the Revit model.  Other ideas for you
including posting in the Autodesk and / or AUGI Revit discussion groups.  It
is my understanding that Autodesk is working on a "sustainability dashboard"
that in a future (or next?) release may provide additional related analysis
tools.

bunch of 'surfaces' defined, 1,025 to be exact, it seems to me like there
needs to be more in a gbXML file to perform and energy model than just
'surface' polygon definitions.  Is this Architect providing me with an
appropriate file, are there other ways to achieve better interoperability
between his architectural needs and my energy analysis needs?

 

Thank you for all of your continued assistance.

 

Sincerely,

Josh

For gbXML to eQuest, check out www.greenbuildingstudio.com ...

 

You can import the gbXML into GBS, then save as DOE-2 file.  However, this
DOE-2 file cannot be edited with eQuest wizards.  You'll need to do all
editing going forward in the detailed interface.  If you've not done any
projects yet with eQuest, there IS a learning curve that seems to vary
inversely with the cube of your overall level of computing expertise ;-)  

 

So if the project is coming from Revit, be sure to check out IES
<http://www.iesve.com/content/default.asp?page=s97_1> .  Despite the
relatively spendy price tag, you may be time and money ahead in the race to
obtain meaningful results.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Equest and gbXML import

Hello All,

 

I am a moderately experienced Equest user and a first time inquirer to the
Bldg Sim forum, and I have just been posed with a question from my boss to
which I don't know the answer.  Is it possible to import a gbXML file into
Equest? We are trying to collaborate our design efforts with our client, an
architect working in Revit, who has send us a gbXML file to use for our
energy modeling purposes.  Are their other software suites that will convert
gbXML to a regular Equest *.inp file?

 

I look forward to working with and contributing further with you all at the
Bldg Sim forum.

 

Happy New Year,

 

Sincerely,

Josh Talbert

Kevin,

The values in Table G3.1.2.9 gives a total for bhp for the sum of all fans in each HVAC system, which includes "supply, return, exhaust, and relief (excluding power to fan powered VAV boxes)". Not for each separate fan. The exhaust fan is most likely exhausting air that has been supplied by some HVAC system and its bhp would need to be included in that systems calculation. I think that section of Appendix G is poorly written and could be clarified.

Does Table G3.1.2.9 apply to stand-alone exhaust fans?  It seems that when
having a VAV system type the baseline exhaust fan power is a lot more then
the proposed design, and a baseline exhaust fan power calculated using the
constant volume calc gives a more reasonable baseline.  Any thoughts?

Message-ID: <004b01c84f13$90503e50$7301a8c0@rushingreed>

In calculating the fan power for the baseline system I used the equation
in section G3.1.2.9.  For my proposed building I took the bhp from the
equipment submittals and used the same equation in G3.1.2.9 to convert to
kW in order to calculate my kW/CFM input in eQUEST.  However, after doing
this I get an error when running the simulation due to the air passing
over my chilled water coils being less than 6 deg F more than my chilled
water temperature.  After looking into the problem I found that eQUEST is
calculating a higher fan heat gain than what was shown in the submittal,
based on the kW/CFM input.  I then noticed that if I use a standard
conversion from bhp to kW (1 bhp = 0.7457 kW), I get a lower kW.  Am I
correctly using equation G3.1.2.9 for the proposed fan power or should I
just be doing a standard conversion?  It doesn't seem possible to get the
right temperature across the coil without calculating my proposed fan kW
differently.

Robby,

Either way the kW should be somewhat close unless you are performing the calculation incorrectly. I know this is quite possible, since a while back, as a test, I gave the nightmare formula in the 2004 version of Appendix G and a bhp to three engineers in my office and got three different answers! That said, the correct way to do it is to convert bhp directly to kW. Don't forget to include the efficiency of the motor in the calculation. By the way, that formula will be gone as soon as the 2007 version of Appendix G is published.

Graham,
I suppose you are aware of Council House 2 in Melbourne? See
http://www.gbcaus.org/docs/GBCA_Ch2_factsheet%201.pdf for basic information.
A web search throws up a number of results as well, but not a lot of
specific information.

Lincolne Scott (recently acquired by WSP Group) were the engineers on the
project. They have offices in Sydney and we (Rocky Mountain Institute) work
closely with their US offices, so if you need, I could put you in touch with
someone in their US office, so as to put you through directly with the
relevant folks in Sydney/Melbourne for specifics.

My company, Bovis Lend Lease, is potentially going to be involved in
the design & construct of a high rise ofice building employing active
mass ceilings (high temperature CHW through the structural slab exposed
to the occupied space below) in combination with underfloor air using
19C or so air supplied through Krantz type swirl diffusers.  Being in
Sydney Australia the focus is on cooling rather than heating although
perimeter heating would be provided via a separate underfloor air AHU or
trench heating etc.

The system offers IEQ and energy efficiency advantages in theory ...
though there are a number of fitout and construction challenges.

We are aware of numerous German and Swiss built examples of this type
of system, but understand the Canadians have been applying this type of
system in places thus I am hopeful this forum can assist with my query. 
I would appreciate any information on buildings in operation or
construction with active mass cooling / ceilings outside of Germany and
Switzerland.  Building names and locations as a minimum, but any other
information would be kindly received ...

Regards,
Graham Carter

Message-ID: <FE872D9C4591BF44AAFD986BF73368FF02A2712B@webmail.transsolar.com>

Hello everyone,
 
I'm trying to take my gas use output numbers (Btus) and calculate the
cost of the gas using the pricing scheme from the local utility (Keyspan
in Boston) for a LEED certification. However, I can't figure out what
the scheme means. Can someone tell me what these numbers mean, in terms
of how to write an equation to take my hourly outputs of gas use (from
Trnsys, but I'm doing this in Excel) and calculate final (monthly) cost?
 
"Customer Charge (fixed): $550.41": I'm assuming this is the monthly
base fee.
"Distribution Charge: $1.0322": Dollars per ...?
"Cost of Gas Adjustment CGA (mdcq): $0.8432": Again, no idea
"Cost of Gas Adjustment CGA (Therm): 0.8651": ...
"Local Distrib. Adjustment Charge LDAC: $0.0491": ...
 
(These numbers are under the heading "High Load Factor General Service
Rate - Extra Large," this is for a rather large commercial building
complex.
 
I've gone to the utility's website and found this data, but nothing to
explain it, nor anywhere else on the web. I called them, and just get
passed around their service department because no one seems to be able
to understand how I can have gas numbers without having a building!
 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks,
Cramer

Message-ID: <204431D8D6A6E345A4A76061B4DC38AB1A8FA6279D@NDEXCH.ladco.int>

ASHRAE appendix G allows to use EIA utility rate in lieu of actual rate. Does anybody have experience using EIA utility rate for their LEED projects? I can only find the electrical consumption rate cents/KWH for electricity, does anybody find the electricity demand rate in EIA website? Or is it possible to assume the consumption rate and the demand rate is the same if using EIA rate?

Another question is regarding to design indoor temperature. Appendix G requires a cooling system to be modeled for a heating only system. However, what is the design indoor temperature for the imaginary cooling system? Should I use common 75 degree F or a temperature close to outdoor design temperature to minimize the cooling system? It would affect the total energy modeling outcome since energy recovery is in proposed building system.

Thanks and really appreciated any input.

So I updated the kW/CFM using a conversion of kW = bhp * .7457 / motor
efficiency, but the fan heat delta t is still greater than 3 deg F, which
takes my SAT of 51 deg F down below the 6 deg F minimum between the air
and the coil.  

I'm not sure if this is a result of the calculation or the actual air
handler selection cutting it too close on the 6 deg F separation.  I'm
wondering if it would be alright to manually set the fan delta t to 3 deg
F? The calculated value ranges from 3.06 to 3.11 deg F, meaning I'm only
six thousandths of a degree off to the point of fixing the error. I assume
there isn't a way to get eQUEST to accept a coil delta T of less than 6
deg F, so this seems like the only way to fix this error when I'm using
actual submittal data.

Robby,

Either way the kW should be somewhat close unless you are performing the
calculation incorrectly. I know this is quite possible, since a while
back, as a test, I gave the nightmare formula in the 2004 version of
Appendix G and a bhp to three engineers in my office and got three
different answers! That said, the correct way to do it is to convert bhp
directly to kW. Don't forget to include the efficiency of the motor in the
calculation. By the way, that formula will be gone as soon as the 2007
version of Appendix G is published.

In calculating the fan power for the baseline system I used the equation
in section G3.1.2.9.  For my proposed building I took the bhp from the
equipment submittals and used the same equation in G3.1.2.9 to convert to
kW in order to calculate my kW/CFM input in eQUEST.  However, after doing
this I get an error when running the simulation due to the air passing
over my chilled water coils being less than 6 deg F more than my chilled
water temperature.  After looking into the problem I found that eQUEST is
calculating a higher fan heat gain than what was shown in the submittal,
based on the kW/CFM input.  I then noticed that if I use a standard
conversion from bhp to kW (1 bhp = 0.7457 kW), I get a lower kW.  Am I
correctly using equation G3.1.2.9 for the proposed fan power or should I
just be doing a standard conversion?  It doesn't seem possible to get the
right temperature across the coil without calculating my proposed fan kW
differently.

Message-ID: <da943e850801071229y10803c2ai784247dff767385b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have two questions:

1. I am modeling a single family residential building in the pacific
Northwest with a Ground Source Heat Pump which apart from providing hot
water for the radiant slabs also provides heating for domestic hot water
(DHW). How does one model DHW in this situation? I have calculated the flow
rate (gpm) required for the house and have an annual schedule. I tried to
assign a process load to the Water Loop HP and when i modeled one case with
the process load and the the other without the process load the difference
in the pump energy does not confirm to the hand calculation.

2. This question is independent of the first one (ie no process load
attached to the Water Loop HP). I modeled one case with double low e glazing
on all orientations and the other case had South facing glazing changed to
double clear and rest of orientations with the same double low e glazing.
Both the glazing types were modeled using the library method. The difference
in the results show a penalty of 2% in space heating for the case with South
facing glazing changed to double clear. Understandable, the building
configuration (amount of glazing + shading) is such that insulating property
of glazing provides more benefit than solar penetration. However, I also
note there is a penalty of 11% for the pump energy. There is no daylighting
and nothing different in the two models accept the South facing with
different glazing. There is no cooling modeled for the house as well and
hence no difference in that end use as well. I can understand some increase
in pump energy, but can anyone provide some insight as to why such an impact
on pump energy?


I would greatly appreciate your response.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <1199786172.26080.1230054231@webmail.messagingengine.com>

I wonder if anyone has any experience of outsourcing the creation of
building models.  I know for some time it's been possible to outsource
CAD work but it's been recently suggested to me that we use a similar
technique for offloading the more tedious aspects of the modelling
process.  I'm a bit concerned that the modelling should be done by
someone with enough experience and understanding of the whole analysis
process.  Without this overview we may find the models either lack
sufficient detail, or are over-detailed for the modelling objective.

Does the group think it's a potential time/money saver or is it likely
to be more trouble than it's worth?

Dear all,

I am intending to do a parametric daylighting study for office rooms and 
I am thinking about using the detailed Energy Plus calculation method, 
because I am using E+ for thermal simulations anyway.
Does anybody know if or in how far the detailed EnergyPlus Daylighting 
calculation method is validated? Is there a detailed description of the 
validation and the calculation method available somewhere?

Thank you in advance,

Hello Cramer,

An colleage of mine and I did some recently did some research on Natural Gas
prices for New York State, and we banged our heads against the wall for a
fair bit before figuring out how these rate structures fit together.  The
two of us just took a look at what you listed below and here's our best
guess.

Customer charge is the monthly base
Distribution charge is likely the "delivery" component charged on a "per
therm" or "per ccf" basis
Cost of Gas Adjustment is likely the "supply" component charged on a "per
therm" or "mdcq" basis (not sure what mdcq is, but it seems to me that only
one of these two lines applies to the actual bill, depending which unit you
are billed in (therms vs. mdcq)
Local Distribution Adjustment Charge is likely another fee they tack on per
therm, ccf, or mdcq.

So.... if you were billed in therms, I believe your total bill would be
550.41+(1.0322+0.8651+0.0491) * Therms usage.

Hope that helps!

Best,
Andy

In CO, the customer charge is per day per meter station at $6.136, not related to Therm or CCF.  Distribution charge is per MCF per day, GCA is determined by a complicated equation of projected cost over projected sales plus something minus something. This is not helping you, but the point is that different utility company has different rate structure.

This is part of reason I want to use EIA data to avoid these confusing terms.

Gaurav,

 

Your question #2 can be explained in part using the pump affinity laws.
The pump power increases approximately with the cube of the flow. So if
the flow increases 2% (because the load increased 2%), then the pump
power will be about 1.02^3 = 1.06 (a 6% increase). Going the other way,
the cube root of 1.11 (11%) is 1.035, which corresponds to a flow
increase of 3.5%. The affinity "law" calculation generally understates
the actual power consumption. It assumes that the system curve (head vs.
flow) is a parabola that goes through the origin (0 feet of head at 0
gpm flow), but this is often not the case. There are two common cases
where the system curve will not go through the origin:

 

1)       The system is an open loop with static head to overcome, such
as a cooling tower water loop. In this case when the flow drops near
zero, the pump head approaches the static head of the system (elevation
of the cooling tower, etc.).

 

2)       The system is a closed loop, but the pump speed is controlled
to maintain a differential pressure somewhere in the system. In this
case when the flow drops near zero, the pump head approaches the
differential pressure setpoint, because the pump is still trying to
maintain that differential pressure even when flow is low.

 

Your hydronic system is most likely a closed loop. The pumping power
would increase even if the pump is constant speed due to the additional
piping losses requiring more pump head. For constant speed closed loop
systems, the error from the fan "law" calculation isn't as significant
as it is with the two cases above.

 

The glass change would not only increase your peak load (2%), but would
also increase the amount of time during the year that the system would
need to run to meet the load. This would also increase the annual energy
consumption, which is what I presume you mean by "pump energy."

Sincerely,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest: Ground Source Heat Pump + DHW + Glazing

 

Hi,

 

I have two questions:

 

1. I am modeling a single family residential building in the pacific
Northwest with a Ground Source Heat Pump which apart from providing hot
water for the radiant slabs also provides heating for domestic hot water
(DHW). How does one model DHW in this situation? I have calculated the
flow rate (gpm) required for the house and have an annual schedule. I
tried to assign a process load to the Water Loop HP and when i modeled
one case with the process load and the the other without the process
load the difference in the pump energy does not confirm to the hand
calculation. 

 

2. This question is independent of the first one (ie no process load
attached to the Water Loop HP). I modeled one case with double low e
glazing on all orientations and the other case had South facing glazing
changed to double clear and rest of orientations with the same double
low e glazing. Both the glazing types were modeled using the library
method. The difference in the results show a penalty of 2% in space
heating for the case with South facing glazing changed to double clear.
Understandable, the building configuration (amount of glazing + shading)
is such that insulating property of glazing provides more benefit than
solar penetration. However, I also note there is a penalty of 11% for
the pump energy. There is no daylighting and nothing different in the
two models accept the South facing with different glazing. There is no
cooling modeled for the house as well and hence no difference in that
end use as well. I can understand some increase in pump energy, but can
anyone provide some insight as to why such an impact on pump energy? 

 

 

I would greatly appreciate your response.

 

Thanks.

Hello Cramer,

An colleage of mine and I did some recently did some research on Natural
Gas prices for New York State, and we banged our heads against the wall
for a fair bit before figuring out how these rate structures fit
together.  The two of us just took a look at what you listed below and
here's our best guess. 

Customer charge is the monthly base
Distribution charge is likely the "delivery" component charged on a "per
therm" or "per ccf" basis
Cost of Gas Adjustment is likely the "supply" component charged on a
"per therm" or "mdcq" basis (not sure what mdcq is, but it seems to me
that only one of these two lines applies to the actual bill, depending
which unit you are billed in (therms vs. mdcq) 
Local Distribution Adjustment Charge is likely another fee they tack on
per therm, ccf, or mdcq.

So.... if you were billed in therms, I believe your total bill would be
550.41+(1.0322+0.8651+0.0491) * Therms usage. 

Hope that helps!

Best,
Andy

Gaurav,

 

Addressing your first question with eQuest is a difficult task.   First off,
if you don't have Climate Master's GSHP eQuest "expansion pack," get it
(http://www.climatemaster.com/index/equest).  It adds many GSHP modeling
functions, including DHW, which would accurately capture your DHW energy
requirements.  I think this still requires a dedicated HP to supply DHW.  

 

The real difficulty arises when you plan on using a single HP unit to supply
both radiant heating and DHW since there are no commercially available HP's
(that I'm aware of) that will operate the desuperheater option without a
call for radiant heating.  Obviously, in situations where no radiant heating
call exists, you run the risk of quickly exhausting your DHW supply (unless
you have auxiliary heating).  A practical solution to this involves using an
Indirect Hot Water tank as your radiant buffer tank.  Kudos if you can
figure out a way to model the latter!

I understand that doe2.2 cannot accurately model energy recovery in these

least receive the same tempered air as the dummy zone in the system?

Folks;

Whatever else maybe wrong or right with these approaches, eQ/DOE-2.2 cannot
generally correctly model energy recovery in the OA-FROM-SYS.  This is
because the exhaust/return air to the OA-FROM-SYS in a DOE-2 model is NOT
from the occupied spaces, it is from the dummy/duct zone, which should never
be at the room/return air conditions in either the model or reality. (It
will usually be substantially cooler.) Too bad, because many real DOAS
systems, (which would appear to be best represented with DOE-2's
OA-FROM-SYS) include heat recovery and pre-conditioning.

 

Anyone know if any of the other "typical" simulation programs (TRACE, E+)
represent a DOAS supplying zonal HVAC more correctly? Obviously one could
model them in TRNSYS, and IES-VE.

P.S. I did actually once whip up a convoluted DOE-2.2 "workaround" for this
arrangement. But I will not post it here because it really does not qualify
as "simulation;" calling it a brittle kludge would be charitable. 

 


>>> "Kevin Kyte" <kkyte at robsonwoese.com> 12/14/2007 11:59 AM >>>


I am attempting to model an energy recovery unit (ERU) supplying outside air
for 5 air handling units (AHUs).  I have attempted to do this thus far by
making the ERU a separate system PSZ with dumbo zone and the AHUs use ERU
for OA-FROM-SYSTEM.  



The problem lies within energy recovery capacities, the ERV report
capacities are nowhere near as high as the designed energy recovered so the
coiling coil is undersized and I am getting a lot of inadequate cooling
capability warnings.  The ERU has an additional gas furnace but no
additional cooling.



This is where I may be getting it mixed up because I set the
COOLING-SCHEDULE flagged to off for the entire year and I end up with no
energy recover on the cooling side.  Even if I were to change the ERU to
type PVAVS or SZRH it shows minimal or no recovery.  How should I schedule
cooling?



Are any other parameters that I may be missing, I have included the enthalpy
wheel effectiveness and a control sequence.  How about humidity controls?
Since this suppose to be a LEED certified building will ECMs be necessary?
Or should I go back to doing individual heat recovery for each AHU?  So many
questions.

Subject: RE: [BLDG-SIM] Equest: ERU with added heat and vfd's



The way I would do it is to use the OA-FROM-SYSTEM keyword and add the ERU
as a separate system with ventilation heat recovery.  In this way, you can
define the heat recovery and power and flow characteristics of the ERU
explicitly.  



I usually do this by first creating a very small (1 sq-ft) dummy space, then
a dummy thermal zone for that space.  Then, create the ERU as a 100% OA
constant volume system serving that thermal zone.  Now comes the fun part.
You close eQUEST, open the .inp with a text editor and cut the new system
and all its keywords from the bottom of the list of systems and paste it to
the top of the system list.  If you don't do this, when you run the
simulation, it will complain that the OA-FROM-SYSTEM system referenced does
not precede the current system and will abort the sim.  Now, reopen eQUEST
and in your 6 systems, use the OA-FROM-SYSTEM keyword on the system, OA tab
to define that the ventilation air is coming from your ERU.  



Hope this helps.

Simulating an energy recovery unit which serves six air handling units.  I
suppose this is simply enough, I split the total cfm into percentages for
each unit and incorporate into each unit's heat recovery, yes?  Is there any
way to include additional heat from the energy recovery unit? Perhaps split
the total heat into percentages and include this in each unit's heating
capacity.  How about variable frequency drives on supply and exhaust fans
for energy recovery unit?  Perhaps this could be modeled as a 10% reduction
in the fan power similar to occupancy sensors on lights?  Regarding LEED,
would usgbc need a credit interpretation request for something like this or
maybe just mentioning it as a default overridden in the submittal would
suffice.  Would anyone who has encountered this care to chime in?  Any
suggestions would be forthcoming.  Thank you.

Dear all,

When I model a one-floor building in eQUEST, I found that adding the "lay-in
acoustic tile" ceiling (no insulation added) will cause the peak load
through roof to zero. When eliminate the ceiling, a large part of the
building heat flow will go through the roof.

I also tried several buildings. When added ceiling, then the heat flow
through roof turns to zero. Does anyone have an idea why this happens? 

Thanks a lot.

I am modeling a building with eQUEST that has a tankless, a.k.a.
instantaneous, gas-fired hot water heater.  I am uncertain of how to
baseline the system according to ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G. The standard
states that for a 180,000 BTU/h system the EF (Energy Factor) = 0.62-0.0019V.
So, I set V equal to zero for the tankless/instantaneous gas water heater
and get an EF =0.62.

The question I have for everyone is: How do I translate this baseline EF to
HIR (Heat-input-ratio) for eQUEST?  Is there an accepted method for doing
so?  I saw in a previous post from David Eldridge on 3/21/07 that
calculating HIR = 1/EF leads to unreasonably high values for HIR (In my
example, 1/0.62 = 1.61), but I'm having trouble seeing how else to come up
with a baseline.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Best,
Andy

Andrew,

It is probably incorrect to baseline the instantaneous water heater 
using the current minimum efficiency standard for the residential size 
gas instantaneous water heaters (EF=0.62). According to GAMA's 
Consumer's Directory of Certified Efficiency Ratings for Heating and 
Water Heating Equipment's directory, very few gas instantaneous water 
heater models have EF below 0.80.

Short answer: Yes. 
 
The temperature & humidity of the dummy/duct zone is used in place of the outside air to the system/zones which include the OA-FROM-SYS command. With no loads in this zone, its conditions should be the same as the supply air. To simulate proper dehumidification when modeling a DOAS as PSZ, the zone cooling setpoint schedule would need to be set to 55F or so, and the real DOAS capacities should probably be entered manually. Other model system/zone combinations generally better represent actual DOAS operation, and should be provided as discussion or example by the program authors.

I understand that doe2.2 cannot accurately model energy recovery in these conditions.  Would the zones receiving the outside air from the system at least receive the same tempered air as the dummy zone in the system?

Folks;

Whatever else maybe wrong or right with these approaches, eQ/DOE-2.2 cannot generally correctly model energy recovery in the OA-FROM-SYS.  This is because the exhaust/return air to the OA-FROM-SYS in a DOE-2 model is NOT from the occupied spaces, it is from the dummy/duct zone, which should never be at the room/return air conditions in either the model or reality. (It will usually be substantially cooler.) Too bad, because many real DOAS systems, (which would appear to be best represented with DOE-2's OA-FROM-SYS) include heat recovery and pre-conditioning.

 

Anyone know if any of the other "typical" simulation programs (TRACE, E+) represent a DOAS supplying zonal HVAC more correctly? Obviously one could model them in TRNSYS, and IES-VE.

P.S. I did actually once whip up a convoluted DOE-2.2 "workaround" for this arrangement. But I will not post it here because it really does not qualify as "simulation;" calling it a brittle kludge would be charitable.

I am attempting to model an energy recovery unit (ERU) supplying outside air
for 5 air handling units (AHUs).  I have attempted to do this thus far by
making the ERU a separate system PSZ with dumbo zone and the AHUs use ERU
for OA-FROM-SYSTEM.  



The problem lies within energy recovery capacities, the ERV report
capacities are nowhere near as high as the designed energy recovered so the
coiling coil is undersized and I am getting a lot of inadequate cooling
capability warnings.  The ERU has an additional gas furnace but no
additional cooling.



This is where I may be getting it mixed up because I set the
COOLING-SCHEDULE flagged to off for the entire year and I end up with no
energy recover on the cooling side.  Even if I were to change the ERU to
type PVAVS or SZRH it shows minimal or no recovery.  How should I schedule
cooling?



Are any other parameters that I may be missing, I have included the enthalpy
wheel effectiveness and a control sequence.  How about humidity controls?
Since this suppose to be a LEED certified building will ECMs be necessary?
Or should I go back to doing individual heat recovery for each AHU?  So many
questions.

The way I would do it is to use the OA-FROM-SYSTEM keyword and add the ERU
as a separate system with ventilation heat recovery.  In this way, you can
define the heat recovery and power and flow characteristics of the ERU
explicitly.  



I usually do this by first creating a very small (1 sq-ft) dummy space, then
a dummy thermal zone for that space.  Then, create the ERU as a 100% OA
constant volume system serving that thermal zone.  Now comes the fun part.
You close eQUEST, open the .inp with a text editor and cut the new system
and all its keywords from the bottom of the list of systems and paste it to
the top of the system list.  If you don't do this, when you run the
simulation, it will complain that the OA-FROM-SYSTEM system referenced does
not precede the current system and will abort the sim.  Now, reopen eQUEST
and in your 6 systems, use the OA-FROM-SYSTEM keyword on the system, OA tab
to define that the ventilation air is coming from your ERU.  



Hope this helps.

Simulating an energy recovery unit which serves six air handling units.  I
suppose this is simply enough, I split the total cfm into percentages for
each unit and incorporate into each unit's heat recovery, yes?  Is there any
way to include additional heat from the energy recovery unit? Perhaps split
the total heat into percentages and include this in each unit's heating
capacity.  How about variable frequency drives on supply and exhaust fans
for energy recovery unit?  Perhaps this could be modeled as a 10% reduction
in the fan power similar to occupancy sensors on lights?  Regarding LEED,
would usgbc need a credit interpretation request for something like this or
maybe just mentioning it as a default overridden in the submittal would
suffice.  Would anyone who has encountered this care to chime in?  Any
suggestions would be forthcoming.  Thank you.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] add ceiling in eQUEST



Dear all,

When I model a one-floor building in eQUEST, I found that adding the "lay-in
acoustic tile" ceiling (no insulation added) will cause the peak load
through roof to zero. When eliminate the ceiling, a large part of the
building heat flow will go through the roof.

I also tried several buildings. When added ceiling, then the heat flow
through roof turns to zero. Does anyone have an idea why this happens? 

Thanks a lot.

David

Thank you for your reply.  Your response leads me to two more questions:

1) In the case of an 180 kBTU/h instantaneous heater is it standard practice
to use EF equal to 0.80 (or some other number based on a "bottom of the
heap" instantaneous heater) as you suggested rather than the 0.62 listed in
the standard?

2) How does one translate EF (this or any other) to HIR (Heat-input-ratio)
for use in eQUEST?  Or might it be acceptable to simply look up the "bottom
of the heap" HIR values for instantaneous heaters and use one of them as a
baseline?

I would appreciate responses from any and all - thanks in advance for your

while others are specified as W per location.  It appears to be clear as to
what areas are being referenced in each case.  If it?s the building fa?ade

Andy,

 

Did you catch the footnote on the bottom of Table 7.8 that says,
"Instantaneous water heaters with input rates below 200,000 Btu/hr must
comply with [80% thermal efficiency] if the water heater is designed to
heat water to temperatures 180F or higher."?

 

So, if you're heater does not heat water to 180 F, you can use the EF =
0.62 as your Baseline efficiency in your 90.1 model.  Otherwise, you
must use 80% thermal efficiency as your Baseline.

 

As far as translating the EF into HIR...

 

EF include standby losses, while thermal efficiency does not.  In
eQUEST, the HIR does not include standby losses since this is modeled by
specifying the tank volume and UA.  Since the EF of a tankless unit is
essentially zero, it seems perfectly acceptable to model the HIR as 1/EF
and then set the tank volume to zero in eQUEST.

 

Hope this helps!

Greetings All,

I've run up against an issue for which I'd appreciate some advice.  I'm trying to model the staging of dilution fans which run at 100% even if the building exhaust flow is varying.  At times when the building exhaust flow is reduced sufficiently, we will turn one or more of the fans off.  This is essentially the same as stepped dimming for daylight applications.

I've attempted to create a part-load curve using data points, but the cubic formula that is generated does not even come close to reflecting the "curve" or steps that I actually need.  I've also played around a bit with writing a user expression, but to no avail.  I was attempting to "get" the hourly return fan CFM and use IF/THEN statements to establish a new kW/CFM.  But, I don't that the kW/CFM is used after design and for determining the starting point on the part-load curve.  It does seem like I can get the hourly value for return CFM.  

Has anyone had any success with staging constant speed fans?  If you have suggestions for creating a curve, or on how to use multiple linear curves (a expression for curve selection), I would be grateful.  Or, if you have ideas on syntax for writing the appropriate user expression, I'd be thankful as well.

Obliged,

Andrew,

It is probably incorrect to baseline the instantaneous water heater 
using the current minimum efficiency standard for the residential size 
gas instantaneous water heaters (EF=0.62). According to GAMA's 
Consumer's Directory of Certified Efficiency Ratings for Heating and 
Water Heating Equipment's directory, very few gas instantaneous water 
heater models have EF below 0.80.

Dear Colleagues,

I am just starting with a research dealing with the energy performance  
of urban
buildings. The focus is put on the urban context, that is how would be  
the energy consumption, thermal and comfort conditions of a building  
if placed in a dense built area? also which urban and building  
describers are the most decisive? Several urban arrangements (plan  
density, H/W, etc.) and various building shapes (and  
properties:Materials, Use, etc.) will be studied.

I am right now looking for the best tool for performing my  
simulations, so preferably a building energy model (with a strong  
physical basis) but including a 3D geometry module.
I would be very grateful if I can have some expert opinion on which  
tool would be the most appropriate:
1. TRNSYS is a powerful tool but I still do not know whether it can  
include any
surrounding buildings (or even vertical screens offset from the main  
building which would serve to represent those surroudings?)
2. TAS includes a 3D modeller which allows the design of the whole 3D  
area but I have not used it so far so I do not really know its  
capabilities, strengthens and weaknesses.
3. Other models...? Please let me know for any proposed tool about its  
ease of use vs. complexity. and how much time I need to learn use it.
4. Of course, I welcome every advice, literature references, or any  
useful material.
Many Thanks in advance,
Best regards,

Salutations Paul,

The solution I'm about to propose may be somewhat wanting, but nonetheless it is a solution.

Perhaps the quick/easy answer to your boggle is to hand calculate the energy use of the exhaust fans.  Simply use the hourly reports of your system exhaust to tally how many hours you have 6 exhaust fans running versus 5 fans running versus 4 fans running....etc.  Then once you have the hourly summation bins you could easily hand calculate the electrical consumption because your exhaust fans are running at constant speed.

Of course by hand calculating the exhaust fan energy use this will then somewhat skew the results of the peak electrical demand charge.

Best wishes on your endeavor.

Regards,
mark

Hi All, 

 

I'm new to the industry and have been asked to run an energy model that
was constructed in eQuest with actual weather data for 2005 for the
purpose of comparing the model to the actual energy usage. Does anyone
have suggestions or resources for getting actual weather data into a
suitable (TMY or TMY2) format for eQuest? It seems that the TMY2 data
that eQuest uses is in binary and may not use all of the fields that the
TMY2 standard file layout includes. Any help is appreciated. 

 

Have a pleasant day!

	Ventilation - Reports
Message-ID: <B0C039754A09344A9A5E2D8F9FCA9D990CD2DA@exchange5.jsa2.jsace.com>

EQuest 3.6: Modeling a dedicated outside air system (DOAS) which supplies 7 interior zones directly and 48 fancoils. The DOAS MIN-OA-Control = DCV Zone Sensors and MIN-OA-Method = Set by Critical Zone. The critical zone is one of the 7 zones directly supplied by the DOAS. The fan coil MIN-OA-Control = DCV Return Sensor and MIN-OA-Method = Sum of Zone OA and Outside Air From System = DOAS.  


The warning message says " DOAS defined as an OA-FROM-SYSTEM has OA flow requirement of  4667 CFM but its calculated OA flow is only 469 CFM. Its MIN -OUTSIDE - AIR has been reset to meet this requirement..."     

The system summary report for DOAS shows sum of (7) zones: 469 oa cfm and 6240 supply cfm.


Does anyone know....

1) Is the 4667quantity the DCV OA CFM which includes the "calculated 469 cfm" outside air for the 7 zones directly attached to the DOAS  and the outside air to the fancoils that are indirectly attached to the DOAS? Other than the warning, where in the reports can I find this number?

 2) Does the 6240 quantity include the 7 directly supplied zones OA cfm, load cfm (approximately 1570 cfm which is reasonable given the peak load report BTUH) and the 48 fancoils OA cfm?

Hi Farzia:

I am sure there are more robust, but more complicated 3-D models to use.
But many of us use eQuest, which is based on DOE-2.2. The 2.2 program is
an advance of the 25+ years of experience used in the US Department of
Energy's supported DOE-2 program. eQuest now gives us a front end to at
least ramp up various levels of intensity. There are three levels of
opportunity:

1) Schematic Design Wizard - Using a basic floor shape, one can do a
cursory building and a few Energy Efficiency Measures (EEMs).

2) Design Development Wizard - Input floor by floor footprint shapes (or
multiple buildings) with the same level of EEM detail as the Schematic
Wizard.

3) Detailed interface - After creating your building (or buildings) in
either of the above Wizards, input anything DOE-2.2 can muster. 

All three levels can generate a 3-D interface.

You will still need to take a training course to acquaint you with the
basic program "theology" and hierarchies. But I believe this will give
you the best "bang for the buck (or Euro) that is presently available.

And this forum wonderful experts can give you assistance 24/7 (or so it
seems).

	with ASHRAE 90.1-2004
Message-ID: <751150.49318.qm@web32102.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear all,

I have a question about how to define the slab-on-grade floors in eQUEST for compliance with ASHRAE 90.1-2004. In ASHRAE90.1-2004 page 29, the F-facror for unheated slab-on-grade floor is 0.73 and page 101 shows that there is no insulation for these floors. 

To define the ASHRAE base case for LEED, I need to set up the model in eQUEST, in the wizard mode, I define the floor as "earth contact" and there is no insulation. When I went into the detail mode, I found eQUEST program automatically setup two additional layers for the slab-on-grade floors construction: UFMat R=20.886 and Light soil 12 inch. The U-value of the the floors is about 0.042. When I change the concrete layer thickness, there is no change in the U-value.

Could someone tell is this definition correct for compliance with ASHRAE requirement?

Thanks a lot.

Regards,

David

Say I'm simulating a water-to-air heat pump and using PSZ to get energy
recovery.  Since the DOAS is nowhere to be found, is it kosher to total the
energy recovered with the cooling coil energy.  Place this value in the
total cooling capacity and then set the cooling eir to nil.  

 

It's been done before, right?  Since I already have supply delta T at 0.01
and the throttling range at 10 why not right?  

USGBC shouldn't have a problem with this right?

I agree with John, eQuest can be used to simulate an urban scenario using the Design Development Wizard and the Detailed mode. I am not aware of any single software that is geared specifically for an "urban:" scenario testing. However, eQuest allows you to create multiple buildings on a site, and the "fixed shades" feature allows you to create shading shapes on the building exterior simulating street and landscape objects that interact with the building. I am not sure however, about eQuest's handling of radiant exchange between the street materials and the buildings and between the buildings themselves. I've only used it for single building analysis. 

Another software that I looked at (only scratching the surface though) is ECOTECT, which seems to address some of the urban issues that you're interested in. The advantage is that it is a European software and uses metric units which is probably more compatible with your research. However, it is not free (euro 325 for educational purposes euro 80 for student) whereas eQuest is.

Hi Farzia:

I am sure there are more robust, but more complicated 3-D models to
 use.
But many of us use eQuest, which is based on DOE-2.2. The 2.2 program
 is
an advance of the 25+ years of experience used in the US Department of
Energy's supported DOE-2 program. eQuest now gives us a front end to at
least ramp up various levels of intensity. There are three levels of
opportunity:

1) Schematic Design Wizard - Using a basic floor shape, one can do a
cursory building and a few Energy Efficiency Measures (EEMs).

2) Design Development Wizard - Input floor by floor footprint shapes
 (or
multiple buildings) with the same level of EEM detail as the Schematic
Wizard.

3) Detailed interface - After creating your building (or buildings) in
either of the above Wizards, input anything DOE-2.2 can muster. 

All three levels can generate a 3-D interface.

You will still need to take a training course to acquaint you with the
basic program "theology" and hierarchies. But I believe this will give
you the best "bang for the buck (or Euro) that is presently available.

And this forum wonderful experts can give you assistance 24/7 (or so it
seems).

Dear Colleagues,

I am just starting with a research dealing with the energy performance
of urban buildings. The focus is put on the urban context, that is how
would be the energy consumption, thermal and comfort conditions of a
building if placed in a dense built area? also which urban and building
describers are the most decisive? Several urban arrangements (plan
density, H/W, etc.) and various building shapes (and
properties:Materials, Use, etc.) will be studied.

I am right now looking for the best tool for performing my simulations,
so preferably a building energy model (with a strong physical basis)
 but
including a 3D geometry module.
I would be very grateful if I can have some expert opinion on which
 tool
would be the most appropriate:
1. TRNSYS is a powerful tool but I still do not know whether it can
include any surrounding buildings (or even vertical screens offset from
the main building which would serve to represent those surroudings?) 2.
TAS includes a 3D modeller which allows the design of the whole 3D area
but I have not used it so far so I do not really know its capabilities,
strengthens and weaknesses.
3. Other models...? Please let me know for any proposed tool about its
ease of use vs. complexity. and how much time I need to learn use it.
4. Of course, I welcome every advice, literature references, or any
useful material.
Many Thanks in advance,
Best regards,

I believe eQuest has inputs for radiant reflectance off of ground
surfaces, but am unsure how "building to building' would be handled.
 
Not sure the present equate between Euros and USD..

It is possible to re-orientate the building in the Building Data under
Building Shell tab, which you have to be in the the Detailed Data Edit mode.
Just redefine the azimth with respect to your existing building setup.

My company has used Trace for many years with the main purpose to
calculate loads.  Trace has continued to evolve.  However, with the
evolution the program has become more and more detailed for input.
Additionally, the time it takes to calculate results alone can be
extremely lengthy (5+ hours with full year weather data).  Now that the
need for energy modeling especially for LEED has dramatically increased,
I am currently modeling several projects using Trace.  In talking with a
few architects and even a third party energy modeler, they are using
eQuest.  
 
I realize there is a learning curve for energy modeling as well as new
software.  However, my company is looking for an energy modeling program
that allows for straight forward input and reliable/accurate results.
 
I have downloaded eQuest and spent a few hours looking at the program
and capabilities.  At first glance eQuest appears to not be as detailed
in its inputs.
 
Does anyone have any experience with Trace and eQuest?  Pros vs Cons for
energy modeling?
 
Thanks in advance,

Hi,
The system I am trying to model in eQUEST is a series of heat pumps that
are connected to a ground loop heat exchanger. I set up the heat
exchanger and water loop in the water side tab. I selected the 'water
loop heat pump' option on the air side systems and assigned the ground
loop to it. There is a place on the cooling side to assign the loop to
the condenser. However, I don't see anyplace on the heating tab to
assign the loop to the heating side of the heat pump. I am also getting
46% of my heating hours outside the throttling range (guessing this is
because there is no loop attached to the HP). Is there a fix for this?
Should I be using a different system type?

Will Climate master's extension allow me to model this better?

Thanks

The dictionary says the heat pump designation for heat source is an electric
air-to-air.  So I had always thought to just make the heat source be the hot
water loop fed to the heat pumps.  Although when I make the heat source a
hot water loop and zone heat source a heat pump I do not see an electric
load for space heating.  I would also be interested in learning more about
this.

Message-ID: <444E10E864EC2E41ADF26EFCB697C7C3043CC5F4@EXCHCLUST.hei.hargis.biz>

Sherie,
 
Take a look at the DOE2 docuementation PDF's to get a real feel for the
input capabilities of eQuest.  eQuest is, fundamentally, a "training
wheels GUI" for DOE2.  IMHO eQuest/DOE2 provides greater modeling
options than Trace 700, but the learning curve is "inversely
proportional to the cube of your overall computing systems expertise"
;-)
 
We're a 100 plus person MEP firm, and to master (well, begin mastering)
eQuest/DOE2 we essentially dedicated an experienced engineer/computer
guy to do energy studies for a year.   Several junior engineers rotate
as-needed to help out, since as it stands right now there's a fair
amount of technical front-end work to do for every project in first
defining the envelope before proceeding engineering modeling.  
 
Same with Trace, but my issue with Trace is that it lacks visual
feedback as to what the model looks like -- I don't (and who really
does) have time to backcheck a pile of output text reports defining the
building envelope.  eQuest provides a crude but effective 3D color-coded
graphic that provides a quick backchck of model features -- essentially
immediate feedback on missing walls, windows, roofs etc.
 
Am looking forward to the day when drawing data can be read directly by
eQuest or EnergyPlus (E+ has a long-promised SketchUp module in the
works), but it hasn't yet arrived.  We hear that IES can do it for Revit
projects, but we jost don't have any Revit projects in the queue right
now.

I work on a project where a laboratory (without hoods) requires a 100% fresh air system (25 000 cfm) to ventilate the organic waste contained in the air (animal autopsy laboratories). No cross contamination is acceptable for the purpose of the laboratory.

 

We are planning to install a run around coil to recovery the exhaust air energy but as I understand the ASHRAE 90.1 standard, this installation is an obligation and it is not considered as a "credit" in our intention to over perform the energy efficiency performance of the building for the LEED process.

 

Here is my comprehension of the article and please, help me to clarify my thought.

 

1.	In respect to 6.3.6.1, 100% fresh air system needs 50% recovery effectiveness.
2.	The laboratory has no hood, so the exception 6.3.7.2 is not valid for our project.
3.	The system does not exhausting toxic, flammable, paint or corrosive fumes or dust, so the exception 6.3.6.1.c) is not valid for our project.
4.	All the supply air is admitted by one single fan and the entire air is exhausted by a single fan, so the exception 6.3.6.1.h) is not valid for our project.
5.	All others exceptions in regards climate and design conditions are not valid for our project.

 

Does someone have already work on a LEED project with this kind of situation with laboratories?

 

Does organic waste in the air could be considered as "toxic" and then meet the exception 6.3.6.1.c) ?

 

Instead of exhausting the air by one single fan we install two fans, does the exception 6.3.6.1.h) will be met?

 

Do you know any new technology for energy recovery without cross contamination with efficiency better than 50% ?

 

Thank you for your help.

 

Best regards.

Hello and a happy new year to all.

I am trying to import a portion of a building from one eQuest model into
another eQuest model. Is there a simple way of doing this that someone
can recommend? Or a manual you can refer me to that has this detail of

Sherie and all,

Where I work, we also have been using Trace for decades.  I've used 
Trace, HAP, and eQuest. for years now.  Here is my take:

eQuest:

    * Great for quick energy models where room-by-room breakdown of
      loads and energy use is not required. 
    * Not very useful for load calculations.  This is what the eQuest
      training class taught me.  Something about peak load calculations
      not appropriate (weather data?).  I wish they could fix that.  I'd
      be tempted to use eQuest for load calculations.
    * Determine energy impact of improvement measures quickly.
    * Energy use reports are pretty and impress everyone.
    * Like Brandon said, the 3D views of the building geometry is useful
      for checking.
    * Support is best gotten from this mailing list.  Sometimes
      questions go unanswered.
    * The two wizards to get your model mostly done.
    * Free!

Trace:

    * Proven and reliable for loads AND energy study work.
    * Able to do more detailed zone and room breakdown of load components. 
    * Output reports seem to be tailored specifically for load
      calculation and work well for that purpose.
    * Energy and load output reports are not pretty, but the experienced
      users like them.
    * The professional support technicians at Trane are excellent and
      you can get answers fast.
    * Must start your model from scratch every time (although we hear
      they are working on a wizard)
    * Costs a lot of $$$

When we do HVAC design work in conjunction with energy study work, the 
Project Engineer always wants to use Trace for the energy model.  He 
will say that because he already has a Trace model and all we need to do 
is add schedules and energy rates.  It has been my experience that when 
you have a building model detailed enough for load calculations, it is 
WAY too detailed for energy modeling.  The Trace energy calculations 
take too long and are not really more accurate.

5 hours for results on energy modeling is outrageous.  Sounds like a 
loads model is being used for energy modeling.  Time to re-think.  Even 
my large eQuest models only take a few minutes to simulate.

You can do this using the .inp files from the two models. If you have
some familiarity with the DOE2 building description language, you just
need to copy the portion(s) of the "from" file to the "to" file. I use
the word "just" advisedly because, depending on how much is to be
transferred and whether default naming schemes have been used, this can
become a fairly tedious process. You also have to take into
consideration all of the related portions of the contributing file. For
example, if you're adding a new zone, you need to be sure the associated
space is also entered, any applicable schedules are accounted for, etc.

 

Of course, the transferred information can be inserted into the
receiving file and it can replace portions of the receiving file.
Regardless, the final document will obviously have to adhere to all the
BDL requirements. You will find out if you have violated any BDL rules
when the BDL processor runs, but you may also have unintended errors
that do not violate any of those rules (e.g. incorrectly references to
schedules, circulations loops, whatever), so go through the added
portions carefully to make sure you are modeling what you intend.

 

Before undertaking this endeavor, BE SURE YOU HAVE A BACKUP of the
receiving file (I recommend backing up all the files associated with the
receiving model just to be sure you can restart if things don't go
well).

 

Good luck.

To improve on eQUEST loads calculations, you can always choose a design day in Detailed Data Edit mode.  Make sure your CDD and HDD schedule values are what you would want them to be on a heating/cooling design day, and specify a design day in the "Project & Site" area.  You do this by right-clicking on "Project: <uname>," which appears on the top of the list at the left of your screen, directly above a folder called "Global Parameters."  Then you choose "Create Design Day" and go from there.  When you run the simulation, equipment should be sized based on the loads calculated on this design day.  In your .sim file, most/all of the loads reports have "standard" and "design day" pages so that you can compare.  In my experience, sometimes the 99%/1% DD conditions produce smaller loads than the annual simulation, so you'll want to pay attention to that.

You can actually use the Import function in the File menu. It will ask
what *.inp file to import (needs to be done in Detailed Mode). If the
models were made in the SD Wizard, the last slide #41 has a field to
enter in a "Component Name Prefix" that you can tag components with
(i.e. F1 for floor 1 or whatever you like). Doing this prevents
components from colliding during the import process--much quicker than
merging the *.inp's manually! :-)

I need to follow up on my previous e-mail re: importing a portion of one
eQuest model into another. Cutting and pasting between *.inp files can
work, but you need to be careful to get all the pertinent information.
There are so many possibilities of what is intended that it is beyond my
resources and knowledge to begin addressing even a small portion of
them. As Mark points out, an entire model can be incorporated into
another model with the import function. If the intent is to create a
campus situation, this works just fine. If the intent is to end up with
a single building (i.e. the two parts are meant to have thermal
connections via internal surfaces), I don't think importing alone will
provide that functionality. Depending on the intentions of the modeling
effort, you may be able to omit any common surfaces from the thermal
model if conditions are essentially the same on both sides and
reflectivity is not an issue for potential daylighting.

 

If the concept is to "plug" a space from one building into a second
building, to the best of my knowledge you will be in for a grueling
battle (unless the two models are of the same building and the space to
be imported has the same geometry and location as that of the space
being replaced - in which case I would recommend just changing the
features of the existing space to mimic the desired space). I have
wrestled with locating spaces in an existing model in Detailed Design
mode and trust me, it is neither fun nor sufficiently rewarding.

 

Hopefully you have enough information to accomplish what you want
without falling into any traps.

Dear Graham,
I work at an engineering firma in Barcelona, and we are currently designig a small office buidling (2000 m2 aprox) with activated cooling slabs in Tarragona (Latitude 41). The radiant (only cooling)  system is the BKT-Rautherm product by Rehau. The BKT will be presumably installed this coming March.
Moreover, the Rehau offices in Barcelona have the BKT system installed for heating and cooling and its been running for some years.
If you are interested in having more details on the Tarragona building, let me know. Also, if you want more information on the Rehau Headquarters in Barcelona, I can forward your request to our Rehau contact.
Sinecrely,

Jordina Vidal.

  Subject: [Bldg-sim] Case Studies of Active Mass Ceilings


  My company, Bovis Lend Lease, is potentially going to be involved in the design & construct of a high rise ofice building employing active mass ceilings (high temperature CHW through the structural slab exposed to the occupied space below) in combination with underfloor air using 19C or so air supplied through Krantz type swirl diffusers.  Being in Sydney Australia the focus is on cooling rather than heating although perimeter heating would be provided via a separate underfloor air AHU or trench heating etc.

  The system offers IEQ and energy efficiency advantages in theory ... though there are a number of fitout and construction challenges.

  We are aware of numerous German and Swiss built examples of this type of system, but understand the Canadians have been applying this type of system in places thus I am hopeful this forum can assist with my query.  I would appreciate any information on buildings in operation or construction with active mass cooling / ceilings outside of Germany and Switzerland.  Building names and locations as a minimum, but any other information would be kindly received ...

  Regards,
  Graham Carter

 Hello, everyone.

      I have met a problem during my simulation with useing EQUEST 3.61. 

**WARNING**********************************************************************
             ZONE E1 ENE Perim ML Zn (ML.ENE2)    
             might have insufficient heating capability.
             Check that the SYSTEM or ZONE HEATING-CAPACITY plus this
             ZONEs BASEBOARD-RATING is adequate to maintain the ZONE
             specified DESIGN-HEAT-T for the calculated peak ZONE load
             (see LS-A or LS-B for the ZONE peak load.)

             SYSTEM E1 Sys1 (MZS) (ML.ENE2)         
             which supplies the above listed ZONE, has a design heating
             coil exit temperature, HEAT-SET-T,(plus any zone reheat)
             below its MAX-SUPPLY-T or the ZONE DESIGN-HEAT-T, which
             might account for the insufficient heating capability.
    
 I hace checked the 

    AIR SIDE

    This temperature is higher than the above zone's heating HEATING DESIGN TEMPERATURE.

    How can i changing my setting to avoid this warning.

 May be this warning is the reason of  the UNMET HEATING LOAD.

As a former Trace user and an aspiring eQuest user, I would echo Randy's
insight. The paid technical support is fantastic with Trace. I would
send emails to CDSHelp and usually get a response within an hour. While
not perfect, the Trace program is comprehensive and actively updated.
With the new Trace Wizard tool, one can building simple models very fast
(although in order to access this functionality, the initial dialog box
must be closed and the File, New and then select the Wizard ... this is
not intuitive). I also have found great use for the Chiller Plant
Analysis tool that allows me to focus on the central plant if I already
have loads.
 
I suspect that the price of eQuest is a big reason many architects are
"using" eQuest. My experience with energy modeling is that it really
takes detailed inputs to get it right. I typically work on existing
buildings so I need to calibrate with the energy bills. I try to break
the model down by control zones (i.e. if a controller operates the HVAC
system on 3 rooms then those become one zone and the level of detail I
go to from an architectural standpoint. Sometimes this requires room by
room analysis and sometimes I can aggregate these control zones together
if the control and exposures are identical). This often requires a lot
of paper and highlighters to accomplish well. 
 
Having said that, if I want to decide on system X versus system Y, I can
use the Wizard function of Trace to develop a block building, pull in a
sample utility rate, and determine my systems and total energy use
really quickly. It is not 8760 but gets me similar results to a quick
eQuest run. I do like the 3D building model that eQuest develops as a
visual check of the envelope input. It is really useful.
 
In the end, the experience of the user with the tool is more important
than which tool is actually used. Over time one learns the work arounds
of the limitations of all tools or uses a different tool for different
modeling scenarios. 
 
I would suggest trying the Wizard. Learning eQuest in your spare time
and asking the architects to send you the file of the building so that
you can import it from AutoCAD into Trace. Building modeling is a bit of
a slog but once the basic model is built (keeping the end goal of energy
analysis in mind through effective zoning or grouping of systems and
control points), the resultant alternatives can be developed rather
quickly. 
 
I am not sure how large of a system you have that takes 5 hours to run.
I have run a 250,000 square foot high school with 14 VAV systems, 6 H&V
systems, a central plant on 8760 and the run is around 15 minutes (maybe
its time to ask your boss to upgrade that old 386).

Sherie and all,

Where I work, we also have been using Trace for decades.  I've used
Trace, HAP, and eQuest. for years now.  Here is my take:

eQuest:


*	Great for quick energy models where room-by-room breakdown of
loads and energy use is not required.  
	
*	Not very useful for load calculations.  This is what the eQuest
training class taught me.  Something about peak load calculations not
appropriate (weather data?).  I wish they could fix that.  I'd be
tempted to use eQuest for load calculations.
	
*	Determine energy impact of improvement measures quickly. 
*	Energy use reports are pretty and impress everyone. 
*	Like Brandon said, the 3D views of the building geometry is
useful for checking. 
*	Support is best gotten from this mailing list.  Sometimes
questions go unanswered. 
*	The two wizards to get your model mostly done.
	
*	Free!
	

Trace:


*	Proven and reliable for loads AND energy study work.
	
*	Able to do more detailed zone and room breakdown of load
components.  
	
*	Output reports seem to be tailored specifically for load
calculation and work well for that purpose. 
*	Energy and load output reports are not pretty, but the
experienced users like them. 
*	The professional support technicians at Trane are excellent and
you can get answers fast.
	
*	Must start your model from scratch every time (although we hear
they are working on a wizard)
	
*	Costs a lot of $$$
	

When we do HVAC design work in conjunction with energy study work, the
Project Engineer always wants to use Trace for the energy model.  He
will say that because he already has a Trace model and all we need to do
is add schedules and energy rates.  It has been my experience that when
you have a building model detailed enough for load calculations, it is
WAY too detailed for energy modeling.  The Trace energy calculations
take too long and are not really more accurate.

5 hours for results on energy modeling is outrageous.  Sounds like a
loads model is being used for energy modeling.  Time to re-think.  Even
my large eQuest models only take a few minutes to simulate.

Randy

Hello,

 

I am using IES to conduct a CFD model on a long and narrow room (283ft
by 60ft) with three large ducts (square 4ft by 4ft) running along the
ceiling (280ft long, 28ft off the floor). I have 18 diffusers equally
spaced along each of the three 280ft ducts for a total of 54. Each
diffuser has a CFM of 1110, an area of 3.75 sf, and a discharge velocity
of 300 fpm. There is a single return grill at one end of the building. 

 

My problem is: when I look at the velocity vectors in the MicroFlo
Viewer some of the diffusers have the air flowing backwards or into the
diffuser, not flowing out as it is supposed to. This occurs across all
three duct lengths at the same diffuser location. 

 

Has anyone else run into this and have they resolved the issue?  IES
took my model and made changes to it only to find that they could not
fix it. 

 

Thank you in advance for any advice, 

Josh

As a post script, I have found Trace to run rather/very quickly as well - even for large buildings with complex systems as Kevin indicates below.  
I think the key is to make sure you are maximizing the use of Trace's templates.
Trace's use of templates is a very nice feature and seems to be a potential benefit over Equest (although, I'm just a beginning Equest user).  
Each energy modeling program seems to have its own pros and cons, though, with no one program being all things to all people on all projects.

Hello - I'm working on a project where I have access to a .dwg file to
import into equest to start building the model from.  Since the building
(existing, single story) is very complex in shape it would save me hours and
hours to be able to import it.  

 

I used Turbo-CAD to go into the .dwg file and remove all layers except one -
the one showing the building outline.  I assumed that I could just open
equest and go to import and bring the file in but it's not working (an error
message shows up and then it stops - the message is that the U-name is too
long. However since the process stops, there may be other error messages).  

 

I have not been able to find, anywhere, instructions on how to import a .dwg
file - I've also searched the archives and found discussions on importing
but not on how.  So how do I import a .dwg file? Any help is hugely
appreciated!

story buildings). I had built this in the Design Development Wizard ,
verified i could see the entire campus 3-D (and am still in that mode)
and actually ran a preliminary shot with results.  Now I am going back
through to correct final inputs from new information.
 
NOW upon recompiling, I receive and error message that says "ShellWiz
has no valid ZnGrpWiz children."
 
Has anyone encountered this before?
 
Thanks.

Vicki -
 
Importing from CAD drawing is one of my favourite eQUEST features --
it does save hours in take-offs and building zoning.
 
Where are you in eQUEST when you import?
 
In the DD wizard, go to the footprint screen for the shell.  Select
custom footprint, hit the ... button (to edit the custom footprint).
It should prompt you whether you want to import a CAD file here --
yes!  Now the trick is often setting the scale.  Remember that it the
custom footprint editor, you can hit the "D" button on the toolbar and
then zoom in and out -- this toggles the zoom for the drawing only,
not your footprint or zones.  So, what I do is start with a rectangle
footprint of roughly the same size as your building -- leave that as
the background when you switch to the custom background to give you a
scale to work from.  Then, zoom and pan your drawing only out until it
matches the scale and lines up with your project axis.
 
If this is not the answer, possible issues - TurboCAD file format is
different from AutoCAD.
 
Hope this helps.

Hello - I'm working on a project where I have access to a .dwg file to
import into equest to start building the model from.  Since the
building (existing, single story) is very complex in shape it would
save me hours and hours to be able to import it.  

 

I used Turbo-CAD to go into the .dwg file and remove all layers except
one - the one showing the building outline.  I assumed that I could
just open equest and go to import and bring the file in but it's not
working (an error message shows up and then it stops - the message is
that the U-name is too long. However since the process stops, there
may be other error messages).  

 

I have not been able to find, anywhere, instructions on how to import
a .dwg file - I've also searched the archives and found discussions on
importing but not on how.  So how do I import a .dwg file? Any help is
hugely appreciated!

Hi;

The flow volume vs output pressure of the flow source is critical in 
these cases.  Are you modeling   1) Open bladed fans, 2) Tube axial fans, 
3) Centrifugal blowers ?? 

Have you tried using CBs in the reverse flow locations ???


The nearest application to your problem is the flow in turkey sheds. 
In the Mid Atlantic region they are typically 50 ft wide, 650 or 900 ft 
long and  7 ft to 9ft high
inside with blowers distributed along the side walls. 
In the Midwest they are 80 ft wide, and proportionately shorter.
These variations have been well examined by the poultry industry and  
Virginia  Tech University.
There is also the "Mid West Plan Service" which is run out of either the 
U of Minnesota or U Wisconsin.
It gives detailed information on large Agricultural buildings......

By the way if your room is 283 ft long and the ducts are 280 ft long,  
you already have a significant
problem......

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest model using actual weather data

Hi All, 

 

I?m new to the industry and have been asked to run an energy model that was constructed in eQuest with actual weather data for 2005 for the purpose of comparing the model to the actual energy usage. Does anyone have suggestions or resources for getting actual weather data into a suitable (TMY or TMY2) format for eQuest? It seems that the TMY2 data that eQuest uses is in binary and may not use all of the fields that the TMY2 standard file layout includes. Any help is appreciated. 

 

Have a pleasant day!

Dear Demba,
 
I can't comment on eQuest but I can offer some suggestions on what is
important to look for in a system design tool:
 
1. First, you need the ability to size the full range of components you
find in an HVAC system - including room diffusers, air terminals,
ductwork, circulation fans, central cooling and heating coils, chillers
and boilers, as well as fan coil units, terminal PTAC or WSHP equipment,
baseboard heaters.
 
2. To properly size this range of equipment you need the ability to look
at peak loads at a wide range of times of day and times of year -
meaning multiple "design" weather days per year.  For instance the time
when a room peaks may be different from the time a central coil peaks
which may be different from the time a chiller peaks.  All of this
influences sizing of particular components in the system.  Software
designed specifically for system design typically uses the industry
practice of evaluating one design cooling day for each month so that
both time of day and time of year factors can be considered.  The design
days are 24-hour profiles which include warmer than normal temperatures
such as a 0.4% summer design point for a month like July or August in
North America and the equivalent type of value for off-peak months, as
well as clear sky solar radiation appropriate for the time of year -
typically the 21st of the month.  So the key is having the ability to
look at multiple design days per year rather than one design day.
 
3. Proper system sizing also relies on a using "system-based" approach
which accounts for the different procedures used to size different types
of systems and equipment.  For example, the central fan in a
multiple-zone CAV system is sized differently from the central fan in a
multiple-zone VAV system.
 
4. Also useful is a roster of reports that provide bottom line sizing
results as well as more detailed information such as component load
breakdowns in an efficient manner. 
 
Software developed with a specific focus on the system design work will
typically offer these key features.  The HAP software you mentioned is
one such tool, but there are certainly others out there as well.
 
Hope this helps.
 
Best Regards,
 
Jim Pegues

The below is probably the best first start text book and one that most
universities and CFD courses have in the reference lists.


An Introduction To Computational Fluid Dynamics: The Finite Volume Method

Versteeg, H. K.; Author: With Malalasekera, W.
Published: August 1995
Pearson Higher Education
ISBN: 0582218845

Pretty comprehensive introduction to the black art but not purely associated
with buildings.   You'll need to hit the journals for more dedicated stuff
probably but they will depend on your area of work.

Someone on CFDonline might know of better texts and they have a useful list
of references there too.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest Coil Temperature Differential
Message-ID: <003e01c856d3$33449540$2f01a8c0@Studer>

Hello,

eQuest allows users to specify loop and coil design temperature
differentials, and yet it appears that these setpoints are not maintained
within the program.  For example, I can specify a hot water loop temperature
differential of 25?F and specify that all the coils are selected at 25?F,
yet the hourly temperature differentials are typically 40?F even when the
supply hot water temperature is held constant at the design temperature
throughout the year.  With 2-way control valves it seems as though the
temperature differential across the coils should remain within several
degrees of 25?F.  Do you agree?

The impact of the high coil/loop differential temperatures is the
underestimate of pump energy.

I posted a question similar to this in October and did not get a response,
so your input is greatly appreciated!

Thanks for your time,

Eric

Thank you to everyone who sent me instructions and tips on how to import a
.dwg file into equest.  Once I found out how to do it, it then became clear
(as was brought up in past discussions) that the file was created in a
recent version of a CAD program and I need to create this file in an older
version.  [but the project is now on hold...]

Message-ID: <1901717528DF6E4EA2EEB294C11E785035821E@MULTIORG1.cgnetmo.org>

Joshua,

 

If the velocity in the main duct is extremely high, it could be sucking
air into the duct. The high velocity pressure of the air in the main
duct can lower the static pressure in the duct below the room static
pressure. This aspirating effect is used in chemistry labs to produce a
vacuum in a system by hooking a hose as a side tap to another hose with
water running through it. It can also be demonstrated with a simple
experiment. Hold the short end of a dollar bill directly below your
lower lip, with the other end of the dollar bill hanging down. Now blow.
The dollar bill will fly up like a flag. Your high-velocity air is like
the air in the duct, and the low pressure in the main air stream is
sucking up the dollar bill like the air in the duct is sucking air out
of the room. I recommend estimating the velocity pressure and the static
pressure at the problem points to see if aspiration is causing the
problem.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] IES CFD Modeling Issue: Reverse Flow through
Diffusers

 

Hello,

 

I am using IES to conduct a CFD model on a long and narrow room (283ft
by 60ft) with three large ducts (square 4ft by 4ft) running along the
ceiling (280ft long, 28ft off the floor). I have 18 diffusers equally
spaced along each of the three 280ft ducts for a total of 54. Each
diffuser has a CFM of 1110, an area of 3.75 sf, and a discharge velocity
of 300 fpm. There is a single return grill at one end of the building. 

 

My problem is: when I look at the velocity vectors in the MicroFlo
Viewer some of the diffusers have the air flowing backwards or into the
diffuser, not flowing out as it is supposed to. This occurs across all
three duct lengths at the same diffuser location. 

 

Has anyone else run into this and have they resolved the issue?  IES
took my model and made changes to it only to find that they could not
fix it. 

 

Thank you in advance for any advice, 

Josh

Message-ID: <s78bb67f.015@rwdi.com>

Hello,

I have modelled a PSZ HP system in eQUEST to satisfy a single zone and
have set the maximum humidity to 50%. The DOE2 help file for this system
type says that the PSZ can be used for humidity control of the control
zone because the location of the condenser coil is downstream of the
cooling coil. This suggests to me that reheat should come with no
additional compressor energy requirement. However, the hourly outputs I
have generated show that additional compressor energy is required. Can
anyone explain why?

Thanks
Derek

Hi all,

I'd like to get a better sense of how much more stringent Standard 90.1 has
become with each iteration. My (hearsay?) understanding was that a building
under 1999 required about 8% lower energy consumption to meet the standard
than 1989.  And I've heard the 2010 version is going to be 30% lower than
2001. Are these figures correct, and can anyone tell me how 01/04/07 fit in?

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest - conditioned office w mezzanine
Message-ID: <002e01c857a0$ec36fe30$4714010a@GaiaDev>

Hello all,

I am using eQuest to model an unconditioned warehouse with conditioned office space in one corner. The warehouse has 40 ft high ceilings. The office space has 10 ft high ceilings, above which is a mezzanine that includes the remaining 30ft (and opens up to the rest of the warehouse). Only the office space is conditioned. I have modeled the whole building as one shell with the office corner as a separate zone.
I can add and remove interior walls in the detailed interface until the geometry is right, but then I don't know how to designate the "lower" space as conditioned and the mezzanine space as unconditioned. 
My question is; Have I taken the right approach to modeling this situation? And how can condition the office and not the mezzanine?
Should I use 3 different shells (warehouse, office, and mezzanine)? I don't think I want a 30ft plenum.
Any advice would be very helpful.
Thanks,

Duke Graham

I am currently using eQUEST to carry out an ASHRAE 90.1 study on an art
museum. I am new to the software and am in the process of modelling the
skylights positioned in the gallery roof. I was wondering if anyone knew
how I would go about modelling the 1.25" frames that surround these
skylights? The frames obviously have a different U-values to the roof
construction and the glazing. Do I have to manually draw the frames
surrounding the skylights or is there a way of generating the frames
when I create the glazing construction profile?

Many thanks

Pete

Dear all,

We're hitting a few snags when importing a gbXML from a large Revit model
into IES with respect to the following issues:


   - Bringing all missing surface areas down to zero (during model
   checking)
   - Bringing sunshades (on curtain walls) with horizontal cylindrical
   tubes in them in. Vertical fin sunshades on punched openings are importing
   fine.
   - Bringing all curtain wall glazing in as transparent panels. We
   checked over and over to make sure all panels within the curtain wall are of
   the same type, some come in as transparent, some come in as opaque.

If anyone has dealt with and overcome these issues, pointers are highly
appreciated.

hello experts-we are trying to use results from a blower door test in
equest.
the test was performed at 50 pascals and then the consultant converted the
number to normal winter condition.

doe2 accepts ach normalized at 10 mph? so my question is which number to
input, at "normal condition" or ach at 25 pascals (which i believe is
equivalent to 10 mph)?
thanks for enlightenment!

I guess it depends rather on the software you're using. ;)

I'm doing a modeling comparison in REM/Rate of two identical houses except
one has 8" insulated core masonry block walls whereas the second has 4" wood
stud insulated walls. Both walls end up having comparable U values. REM/Rate
shows negligible difference in energy usage. I am suspicious that REM/Rate
does not model the thermal bridging and mass features very well. Would I be
better served performing this comparison in DOE-2 or would the results not
be that much different?

REMRate merely takes the UA of the whole house and calculates energy use
based on heating degree and cooling degree days.  It also takes into account
thermal gain from windows, infiltration and calculates internal energy use
(lights, appliances, etc), but does not do a full 24-hr 365 day simulation.

For frame walls with batt insulation, both REMRate and the eQuest Wizard
will calculate the overall wall U-value based on their estimate of the ratio
of framing material to insulation.  For advanced construction techniques, I
usually calculate average U-value the parallel path method.  I then enter
this as "continuous" insulation in either REMRate or eQuest, and then other
relevant information, such as thermal mass.  eQuest will take into account
thermal mass, whereas I don't believe REMRate does.  Sometimes masonry wall
manufacturers will claim a higher than actual R-value due to the thermal
mass properties of the wall.  This is one case where eQuest will do a better
job--, if entered properly.  I don't believe REMRate takes thermal mass into
account.

Unfortunately though, eQuest can't be used for HERS ratings, so if that is
your final goal, you're stuck with what you have.

Hope this helps,

~Karen~

Depending on where the home you're modeling is located, thermal mass in exterior walls may or may not have a significant impact on the energy use of the home.  Generally speaking, thermal mass in exterior walls has the greatest impact on energy use in climates with large diurnal temperature swings that cross the interior balance point of the home.  This tends to occur most often in high desert climates.

Because REM/Rate does not employ hourly simulation, it cannot explicitly model the dynamic effects of mass in exterior walls.  However, there is an attempt to account for the impact of mass in exterior walls in REM/Rate using climate-specific U-value adjustment factors from 2003 and previous versions of the IECC.

Christian:

If you are interested in seeing the detailed annual energy impacts of 
different composite wall constructions in residential buildings, you 
might consider modeling this residence using the TREAT software tool 
(http://www.treatsoftware.com - free 30 day download), which uses the 
SUNREL engine as the basis of 8760 hour whole building energy 
calculations. The SUNREL engine is unique among commercially available 
energy simulation engines in that it incorporates a one-dimensional 
finite difference nodal thermal network model (that's a mouthful) for 
calculating wall conduction losses. In this method, there is no need to 
calculate custom room weighing factors, etc, (needed in DOE2.x) as 
conduction transfer functions are not used.  The SUNREL engine was 
specifically designed to accommodate evaluating modeling the effects of 
conduction in stud/cavity composite types of wall/roof constructions. 
Thermal mass, (thickness, specific heat, density, and conductivity) of 
the composite construction is accounted for in gory detail.

Check out the page 14 of the SUNREL Technical Reference Manual for a 
visual representation of how composite wall constructions are handled in 
TREAT using SUNREL:

http://www.nrel.gov/buildings/sunrel/pdfs/sunrel_tech_ref_30193.pdf

Note that TREAT ships with a standard library of envelope construction 
types, (NOT user definable), but I think you will find they meet your 
needs.

BEWARE - the current release of TREAT (V3.0.27) cannot be user to 
provide a HERS rating, however our next release (targeted spring '08) 
will have this capability again.

Happy Modeling!!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] One off topic LEED Question, one IBPSA meeting question
Message-ID: <98AA5A22431A3742AD15F4678001807E02C0F3FF@il-com2.il.grummanbutkus.com>

One of our clients is interested in certifying a portion of their new
building under LEED-CI.  Can an owner complete a LEED-CI project in
their own building?

The rest of the building would not be certified under LEED-NC, while
obviously encouraged, this isn't a requirement for the typical tenant
build-out.  The wording in the CI rating system doesn't specifically
mention the possibility for an owner to be their own tenant.

Any thoughts?

Separate question:  anyone coming to IBPSA meeting Saturday morning and
want to split transportation from LaGuardia let me know, ~10:30am.  My
default will be to try out the metropolitan transportation authority
since I haven't experienced that before.

David

A part-time position has arisen for 2.5 years to work with Dr Ian Knight at the Welsh School of Architecture in the UK. The work will involve the successful candidate in modelling the integrated performance of buildings and A/C systems in E+ or TRNSYS as well as overseeing the collection of data from real A/C systems to substantiate the modelling work. The project outputs are anticipated by Member States across Europe and the postholder will achieve a very high profile in the academic and industry communities over this period.
 
The post is funded for 2.5 days per week by the European Commission, which would provide the postholder with time to undertake a higher degree in the Department if desired. As a member of staff this degree would be substantially cheaper than if enrolling as a full-time student.
 
If you are interested in knowing more either contact Ian direct on +44 2920 875496 (leave contact details if no answer) or email on: knight at cf.ac.uk

I?m doing a modeling comparison in REM/Rate of two identical houses except one has 8? insulated core masonry block walls whereas the second has 4? wood stud insulated walls. Both walls end up having comparable U values. REM/Rate shows negligible difference in energy usage. I am suspicious that REM/Rate does not model the thermal bridging and mass features very well. Would I be better served performing this comparison in DOE-2 or would the results not be that much different?

Message-ID: <479466FD.01DF.005E.0@archenergy.com>

If eQUEST shows a model doesn't comply w/Title 24, is there an eQUEST report to tell me why it didn't comply (or should I look on the Title 24 report)?  For my model, the compliance margin is fine so I'm guessing it must be some other mandatory measure.  
 
I tried a run changing the 2 constructions in the Exceptional Conditions section to be constructions from T24's App IV, and although this error no longer appeared on the report, the building still did not comply.  The model also had some problems meeting the loads so I made those spaces unconditioned and uninhabited.  It then had no problems with loads, but still failed.

Message-ID: <69a9bc0a0801211111u5d4de9can4ff858ae307acc62@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm working on a project to evaluate alternatives for energy efficient
renovations to an existing old brick mill (built 1910), total floor area of
160,000 sf.  The building is located in VT, currently has no wall
insulation, and about 33% window to wall ratio.  My client is interested in
what has been accomplished in regards to energy efficiency (and renewable
energy) on other similar projects.  If you know of or have worked on old
brick buildings that have been renovated to drastically reduce energy use,
I'd be interested in hearing about the project.


Thank You,

There's lots of work published on energy efficient renovations in old masonry buildings.  Being Vermont, you want to make sure you start with a hygrothermal analysis of what can be safely done in terms of heat, air and moisture management.  Check with Joe Lstiburek at Building Science Corporation in Boston, or John Straube at the University of Waterloo.  In my experience, energy consumption can be safely and economically reduced by at least 50%, more if you can control air leakage and introduce heat recovery.  If you are willing to consider overcladding, then the thermal mass of the structure will further reduce energy consumption while stabilizing the thermal regime.  In one case study I performed, I discovered that massive, masonry buildings could be retrofit to be greener in terms of energy efficiency than some of our greenest new buildings.  After all, what client would pay for so much thermal mass inboard of the insulation when they often fail to fund steel stud assemblies properly?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Direct Evaporative Coolers & the eQUEST Games
Message-ID: <99A2815FF4D295488E034407278B16A4018DD735@sacexm01.nexant.corp>

Help!  I have been modeling a car dealership which uses several
disparate systems in combination to condition spaces.
 
The baseline HVAC system is Packaged Single Zone with Gas Heat.
 
The actual design for many of the service bays is:
 
Direct Evaporative Cooler
Unit Heater(s)
Exhaust Fans
 
For purposes of modeling the actual design, it seemed appropriate to
model the system as "Evaporative Cool' with "Furnace" selected for heat.
The OA fraction was set to 1.0 (more on this later).  Actual design
capacities were input into the model.  The unfortunate by-product of
this (as is often the case) was that there were a bunch of unmet hours
(76), mostly cooling.
 
So after playing around with several settings, the only way to get the
unmet cooling hours down seemed to be to change the system type back to
"Package Single Zone" and set the unitary power to 0 for the
'compressor' which really does not exist.  This makes the unmet hours go
away, but seems to create a higher heating load, despite the fact that
the actual design has higher thermal efficiency than the baseline.  The
space heating almost doubles from the baseline to the proposed.
 
My suspicion has been that eQUEST does not realize that the evap.
coolers only run during the summer, and thinks it has to heat 100% OA
year-round.  Appendix G says that the minimum outdoor ventilation rates
should be the same (right or wrong) for the proposed and baseline
designs.  So...my solution was to set a minimum OA schedule, with the
summer being 1 and the winter at 0.  Well...this may be closer to
reality, but now the unmet hours spike to 423!
 
So...it seems to be the recurring problem of fixing one problem, only to
create another one.  Any ideas on how better to simulate this?
 
Thanks for any tips in advance.
 
Regard,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest DCV and fan mode
Message-ID: <69a9bc0a0801212037w45b75182x2c08e829189e9213@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.  I'm working late tonight and have come across something a little
strange.  If someone could explain this to me, I'd appreciate it.

I am modeling a building with system type PVVT (heat pump).  Indoor fan mode
during occupied hours is intermittent, night cycle control is enabled.  All
other defaults from the design development wizard are intact.

I set up a parametric run to evaluate energy savings from demand control
ventilation, and... my energy use increases!  Most of the increase is seen
in boiler energy for adding heat to the loop.  I understand that the
ventilation air may need to be heated when the heat pump is not running, but
I wouldn't think that this would put such a load on the boiler, especially
because the overall energy energy needed to condition ventilation air should
be reduced.

Any light on this issue is appreciated.

Thanks,

~Karen~

I have an eQuest model built up using the Design Development Wizard.

I'm not aware of any difference in the way I constructed the various

Can anyone explain why the Wizard sometimes builds a single plenum for
the shell and sometimes builds a plenum for each zone within the shell?
 
I'd like to be able to choose between these options. Thanks for any help

Hi All, 
 
I got a tip from someone and figured out my question.  In case anyone
else is curious: changing the setting in the HVAC wizard from "One
system per floor" to "One system per zone" created a plenum for each
zone.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Chiller Curves & NPLV
Message-ID: <002f01c85d51$610cebb0$7301a8c0@rushingreed>

Hi everyone,

 

I'm working on an energy model for LEED submission.  It's a high rise
office building with CHW and electric heat.  The baseline building is also
a centrifugal chilled water system with electric heat and from Table
6.8.1J it should have a COP of 6.1 & IPLV of 6.4.  COP is a straight
forward input into the chiller as an EIR, but up until now I had assumed
that eQUEST default curves handled the IPLV portion of the efficiency.
When I took a look at the hourly report for the chillers though, the NPLV
(calculated by the ARI 550/590-2003 equation) was 12.1, almost double the
value from the table.

 

In trying to match the NPLV requirement of 6.4 I tried to create an
EIR-FPLR performance curve.  I did this by inputting values of A, B, C,
and D in the ARI equation that would net a value of 6.4 and then using
these four values as inputs for a custom baseline performance curve.
However when I look at the hourly report the Corrected EIR is not what I
calculated.  From what I understand, Corrected EIR = EIR (input at the
chiller) * EIRFT * EIRFPLR, yet when I multiply the EIR * EIR-FT *
EIR-FPLR I get a value almost twice as large.  My EIR is input at rated
conditions, so there shouldn't be any conversion going on within the
program.

 

My questions are:

 

1)       How do you achieve the required NPLV for an Appendix G baseline
building in eQUEST?

2)       What other factors besides EIR-FT & EIR-FPLR affect the Corrected
EIR?

Does appendix G mention the zone reheat temp to use for a baseline?  Seems
like it should in G3.1.2.8.  Should we use the reheat values for the
proposed design?  What if the proposed system does not have reheat?  I just

Hello,
 
I'm trying to model an office building which utilizes winter-time
outdoor air to pre-cool chilled water before sending it to compartmental
unit coils located on each floor to satisfy the year-round cooling loads
in the core of the building.  On the coldest days, supplementary heat is
injected into this loop from the boiler loop which also serves the
perimeter radiators.  The building buys chilled water from the city
through a heat exchanger.  Any thoughts on how to model this system?  I
would be glad to provide additional details if my explanation was
lacking.
 
Thanks,
 
Luka Matutinovic

Message-ID: <47986690.3918.0098.0@archenergy.com>

We haven't had much success using the Title-24 wizard within eQUEST. We get errors that we can't track that prevent the proposed design from demonstrating compliance. We've gotten simple buildings to work but none of the more complex ones that we usually construct. While we have contacted the eQUEST developers, we have not received any support to aid us in trouble shooting the errors. As a result, we have had to build a second model in EnergyPro so that we could demonstrate compliance.
 
What has other people's experience been? Have other firms also had problems with the Title-24 wizard? If so, do you use eQUEST in conjunction with EnergyPro? Do you do all the design assistance analysis AND the compliance analysis in EnergyPro? And then for CA projects there may also be a need to do Savings-By-Design calculations? Are people running into the same problem there with eQUEST?
 
Thanks for any insights you can provide.

I ran into a similar problem myself and it was just a few days before the
deadline. Having received no support from the eQuest developers, I had to
rebuild the model in EnergyPro.



However, I would like to add here that the project I was dealing with has
a complex geometry- the whole building is curvilinear and has sloping roofs
and it helped that I had a 3D eQuest model. I had to print some 170 pages
(85 back to back) of LV-C Report and then input some 120 or so external
walls and roofs into EnergyPro. I was not at all happy doing that in a
matter of 1 day (and night).



In case my email gives an impression of being positive in terms of Title 24
compliance and using eQuest then I would like emphasize - I would never ever
use eQuest for Title 24 compliance.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQUEST sizing air flow for LEED base case
Message-ID: <732818.65795.qm@web32111.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear all,

I have a question for sizing the LEED ASHRAE base case air flow within eQUEST.

In ASHRAE Appendex G, the base case for sizing space air flow rate method is based on supply air and space temperature difference of 20 F. 

Within eQUEST, for system wizard 2, in "Air flows"-"Minimum Design Flow", the default value is 0.5CFM/Ft2. I checked the help file, it says for conventional design, the number is 1CFM/Ft2. I did the sizing simulation based on these
two values and found big difference in the SV-A report "Support  flow". In my understanding, the 0.5CFM/Ft2, or 1CFM/Ft2 only describes the minimum flow rate, why this value will affect the design air flow rate? Could somebody tell what number should I use to sizing design air flow rate for meeting LEED-ASHRAE requirements?

Thanks a lot in advance.

Regards,

David

Two approaches to consider.
 
1.  Ask yourself is whether the evaporative cooler is even capable of
providing the level of cooling you tell it (ie: satisfying your cooling
setpoint)?  Typically direct evaporative coolers are not intended to provide
full cooling capability just cooling relief.  Address the problem by raising
your cooling setpoint in the spaces being served by the evap coolers.  Make
sure to use the same cooling schedule for your baseline model.
 
2.  Simulate the HVAC systems in the proposed design with mechanical cooling
that has the same performance as the baseline but use the direct evap cooler
add-on feature as the first stage of cooling.  While your proposed design
technically doesn't have mechanical cooling I believe the intent of Appendix
G would require you to simulate it in order to satisfy your unmet cooling
hours.  The add-on evap cooling feature in eQuest is able to deal with the
changes in ventilation air required for direct evap cooling so you can get
rid of the crazy MIN-OA-SCH.  The user manuals should give you all the info
you need about the evap cooling keywords you will want to use.  I think
there is even a diagram showing how the evap cooling add-on ties into the
HVAC system.
   
As far as your comment about fixing one problem to create another....welcome
to energy modeling in DOE2.2.  
 
good luck

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Direct Evaporative Coolers & the eQUEST Games


Help!  I have been modeling a car dealership which uses several disparate
systems in combination to condition spaces.
 
The baseline HVAC system is Packaged Single Zone with Gas Heat.
 
The actual design for many of the service bays is:
 
Direct Evaporative Cooler
Unit Heater(s)
Exhaust Fans
 
For purposes of modeling the actual design, it seemed appropriate to model
the system as "Evaporative Cool' with "Furnace" selected for heat.  The OA
fraction was set to 1.0 (more on this later).  Actual design capacities were
input into the model.  The unfortunate by-product of this (as is often the
case) was that there were a bunch of unmet hours (76), mostly cooling.
 
So after playing around with several settings, the only way to get the unmet
cooling hours down seemed to be to change the system type back to "Package
Single Zone" and set the unitary power to 0 for the 'compressor' which
really does not exist.  This makes the unmet hours go away, but seems to
create a higher heating load, despite the fact that the actual design has
higher thermal efficiency than the baseline.  The space heating almost
doubles from the baseline to the proposed.
 
My suspicion has been that eQUEST does not realize that the evap. coolers
only run during the summer, and thinks it has to heat 100% OA year-round.
Appendix G says that the minimum outdoor ventilation rates should be the
same (right or wrong) for the proposed and baseline designs.  So...my
solution was to set a minimum OA schedule, with the summer being 1 and the
winter at 0.  Well...this may be closer to reality, but now the unmet hours
spike to 423!
 
So...it seems to be the recurring problem of fixing one problem, only to
create another one.  Any ideas on how better to simulate this?
 
Thanks for any tips in advance.

Greetings I have just started using eQuest and am working on a relatively simple model (not Tilte 24).

I was considering EnergyPro but was persuaded to go with eQuest.

I am getting the impression from these dialogues (as well as others) over the past week that EnergyPro is a much better program.  

Personally, I have been getting very frustrated with eQuest just in trying to model a basic building - 3 floors with different occupancys/construction; editing schedules, modeling existing HVAC systems.

Is that a general consensous?

While we have contacted the eQUEST developers, we have not received any support to aid us in trouble shooting the errors. As a result, we have had to build a second model in EnergyPro so that we could demonstrate compliance. 

    What has other people's experience been? Have other firms also had problems with the Title-24 wizard? If so, do you use eQUEST in conjunction with EnergyPro? Do you do all the design assistance analysis AND the compliance analysis in EnergyPro? And then for CA projects there may also be a need to do Savings-By-Design calculations? Are people running into the same problem there with eQUEST? 

    Thanks for any insights you can provide.

Here might be why:

When you design an evaporative cooler, you wanna use the design wetbulb and
the effectiveness to figure out the the design supply air T and then the
design CFM.  Say the location is Salt Lake City, UT.  Because the design
wetbulb is 68F, and the resulted supply air T is slightly higher than 68F,
say 70F. Then the designed CFM would be much higher than the value you get
when using 55F as the design supply T. However, eQUEST default supply T is
usually 55F (specified by the keyword: MIN-SUPPLY-T).  If you change that to
68 or even higher, your cooling unmet hours are almost gone.

With this change, you will see the CFM surges dramatically, which is
probably because your high internal loads and higher supply T.  Therefore,
the previous huge unmet hours is due to the lack of CFM. If by doing this,
eQUEST designed CFM is found to be much higher than the actual design, it is
because you and the mechanical guy use different internal loads (assuming
the mechanical design is sound). You would have to talk to him/her to clear
that up.

Of course, you can imagine how much fan energy VFDs on the supply fan of the
evaporative cooler can save if internal gains are huge. Most of the time,
you can get a lower supply T because the OA wetbulb is lower than 68F.
Therefore,  although to erase the unmet hours, your design supply T should
be slightly higher than 68F, ideally you may want to run supply T as low as
possible to save fan energy. So that MIN-SUPPLY-T should be as low as
possible. But I just don't know if there is any other place in eQUEST to set
the design supply T then. If we set the MIN-SUPPLY-T to about 68, supply T
would never go below 68 even if it can. So a lot of fan energy would be
wasted.

So anybody knows another place to plug in the design supply air T?

The technique for importing files from Revit to eQUEST is outlined on
Green Building Studio's. website
(http://www.greenbuildingstudio.com/gbsinc/index.aspx).   They offer a
free trial of their on-line software which takes a gbXML file from Revit
Architecture or MEP and converts it to a usable inp file.  In my
experience with it so far, it is more useful early on when you most
likely have a very simple model.  Complex models (an architect's CD
model for example) with lots of overhangs, shading features and other
extraneous details seem to give it problems.  The potential is very
exciting though.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQUEST air flow for sizing for LEED base case
Message-ID: <508207.76923.qm@web32111.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear all,

I have a question for sizing the LEED ASHRAE base case air flow within eQUEST.

In ASHRAE Appendex G, the base case for sizing space air flow rate method is based on supply air and space temperature difference of 20 F. 

Within eQUEST, for system wizard 2, in "Air flows"-"Minimum Design Flow", the default value is 0.5CFM/Ft2. I checked the help file, it says for conventional design, the number is 1CFM/Ft2. I did the sizing simulation based on these
two values and found big difference in the SV-A report "Supply  flow". In my understanding, the 0.5CFM/Ft2, or 1CFM/Ft2 only describes the minimum flow rate, why this value will affect the design air flow rate? Could somebody tell what number should I use to sizing design air flow rate for meeting LEED-ASHRAE requirements?

Thanks a lot in advance.

Regards,

David

I have imported a full DWG file into eQuest. The DWG file shows a clerestory
running the length of the building's roof. While vertices have been set for
the basic building envelope, in shape view mode I can see the layer assigned
to the clerestory by eQuest as an outline only without any vertices. How can
I either assign vertices for this clerestory including exterior
wall/window/roof properties? Or should I draw the clerestory from scratch?
Thanks.

Peter:

What is the intent of your using an energy modeling
program? Title-24 only? Nationwide (or world wide)
energy analysis? Design loads?

Time and space does not allow all the implications
using either program tha should be understood.
EnergyPro is, in a nutshell, a California Title-24
compliance tool using DOE-2.1E, the last version
blessed by the Us Department of Energy. The front end
is designed for Title-24 inputs, with the Title-24
schedules and allowances.

If you want to do anything else, you can use the
"behind the screen" DOS (??) version of DOE-2.1E.

With eQuest, you can run on three levels of intricacy
and be running an advance to the DOE family, namily
DOE-2.2.

But there is NO WAY in God's earth you can run EITHER
of these programs (or TRACE or HAP) without some
TRAINING. Just because you can fly a cessna does not
mean you are ready for B-747 flying.

Where are you on the Planet? I am SURE there are some
people that can give this training, to help you begin
your journey. Plus this forum.

But it WOULD be nice if EnergyDesign Resources would
fund a hot line for eQuest questions. They could make
a MINT !!

Now back to work..on about 3 eQuest models in various
stages of progress.

Good hunting, Sir..

Peter,

I would second John's thoughts. There is a steep learning curve involved and
training definitely helps. There are so many complexities in each project
with each system and building one is trying to model that each project
results in learning something new. EnergyPro is good for Title 24 compliance
but for energy analysis and trying out different energy efficient measures
such as different glazing, wall assemblies, system types and for LEED,
eQuest is a great tool. We have had discussions earlier on this forum so
please see the archives.

Just to make my position clear- I love eQuest. Most of my work involves
using this software. There are so many things that one can do with
eQuest, that one can not do with other software- e.g. the 3D model of the
building is a great feature in eQuest. I can't imagine if I could have done
that complex geometry in EnergyPro itself. And it was a blessing in disguise
that I had an eQuest model for the project.

But then again, I will never use eQuest for Title 24 compliance.

If you are using Packaged Single Zone system to simulate the evaporative
cooler (without mechanical cooling). Other tricks you have to play to get
the system running with no unmet cooling hours are:

1. Specify the mechanical cooling capacity to a very small number, like 0.01,
so mechanical cooling wont kick off. (As I recall, 0 wont work, because
eQUEST treats cooling capacity of 0 as autosizing, so you would still have
machanical cooling).

2. Find another keyword named EVAP-CL-LIMIT-T in the add-on evaporative
cooling tab, raise it from the default value (usually 90) to over the
maximum OA drybulb of your site. EVAP-CL-LIMIT-T specifies outside air
dry-bulb temperature above which the evaporative cooler will be turned
off. A low EVAP-CL-LIMIT-T will turn off the evaporative cooler when cooling
is still needed, and without mechanical cooling, your unmet cooling hours
will go up because nothing is air conditioning the space.

Message-ID: <444E10E864EC2E41ADF26EFCB697C7C304463B1E@EXCHCLUST.hei.hargis.biz>

All,
 
This started out to be a question, but in the course of making it
intelligible I discovered the answer.
 
My objective was to set the user default expression for fin tube
radiation to something like 30 BTUH per square foot in each zone.
However I couldn't figure out how to get the AREA defined by the SPACE
which corresponds to the ZONE into the zone's user expression... 
 
SPACE is not a parent, grandparent or great grandparent of a ZONE -- and
the #P (Parent) funtion was on the frontier of my BDL knowledge.  So
after a couple hours of headbanging while reading the "KEYWORD
EXPRESSIONS / BDL Functions" subsection of the "Building Description
Language" chapter of the DOE-2.2 Vol 3: 'Topics' manual, I was ready to
throw in the towel and ask the group, as nothing was coming up on an
archive search.  
 
But in the process of writing this e-mail, I chanced to read the #LR
(LocalRef) definition one last time and the light bulb went on.  So here
it is, a very simple user default expression for zone fin tube radiation
HEATING-CAPACITY, set to 30 BTUH per square foot (negative sign req'd by
convention):
  
 
#LR("SPACE","AREA")*-30                         $ as entered into eQuest

 
HEATING-CAPACITY = {#LR("SPACE","AREA")*-30}    $ as stored in the .inp
file
 
 
Enjoy, my head is still hurting...

Ellen,

We have bumped into bugs and hiccups doing Title 24 compliance runs in
eQUEST too. Two suggestions that I can offer:

If the compliance run completes normally and shows savings over the standard
but yet the building inexplicably does not comply, try reviewing the hours
out of throttling range in the standard run. It's likely that the system in
your base model meets the loads fine with few hours out of throttling but
that the model of the standard building has excessive hours out of
throttling range due to the translation of the ruleset. Make sure to select
the option for full reporting before you start the compliance run so that
you can identify where the loads are not met (SS-R is a good place to look).
You can also open the .INP for the standard run, create a new .PD2 for it,
and then dig into what the underlying problem is. The trick is to change
your original model so that it still reflects your proposed building, but
also limits the hours of throttling in the standard run. 

Also, look for the .CAL file that is generated when you do T24 compliance
runs in eQUEST. If there are errors, they should be reported in there.
Supposedly there is a toggle in one of the .INI files in the eQUEST program
file directory that can increase the level of reporting to this .CAL file
too.

Best of luck.

Hwakong

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Title-24 modeling w/ eQUEST

 

We haven't had much success using the Title-24 wizard within eQUEST. We get
errors that we can't track that prevent the proposed design from
demonstrating compliance. We've gotten simple buildings to work but none of
the more complex ones that we usually construct. While we have contacted the
eQUEST developers, we have not received any support to aid us in trouble
shooting the errors. As a result, we have had to build a second model in
EnergyPro so that we could demonstrate compliance.

 

What has other people's experience been? Have other firms also had problems
with the Title-24 wizard? If so, do you use eQUEST in conjunction with
EnergyPro? Do you do all the design assistance analysis AND the compliance
analysis in EnergyPro? And then for CA projects there may also be a need to
do Savings-By-Design calculations? Are people running into the same problem
there with eQUEST?

 

Thanks for any insights you can provide.

 

Ellen

Yes, my head really is hurting...!  
 
Just in case you're actually following this example, the keyword for
zone baseboard heating capacity is BASEBOARD-RATING
 
 
#LR("SPACE","AREA")*-30                         $ as entered into eQuest

Randy - To me it seems that the issue is the way the reply headers are 
set up on this list, it defaults to replying only to the person that 
asked the question.

It's better now, at least it adds bldg-sim as a CC if you reply to all, 
it didn't used to do that (if I remember correctly from years ago).

I agree with your frustration that there is a huge body of knowledge 
being lost because of that however I don't want to be critical because 
it's a free list and I know from my own experience that administering 
these types of lists is time consuming so overall I am grateful to the 
list owner and administrator.

Message-ID: <C9D15FDE9DC3244EB971B56AD1604F8503B90C2A@sg-exchbe3.smithgroup.com>

Hello All,
Need to have some inputs on how to model only one zone in a university
building.
It is a 7 floors tall atrium of a university, where only the first floor
that is occupied (the entrance area).
The HVAC is only dedicated to maintain the first two floors of the
atrium and will let the air to stratify to the top of the atrium.
Questions:
1. Since I am only interested in the load of the atrium, can we model
this area without modeling the rest of the school building?
2. What is the strategy to model the first floor (occupied and
conditioned area) of the atrium and the rest of the atrium (where
stratification occurs)?
3. Can stratification be modeled in eQuest? How?
4. Adjacent to the atrium, class building, how do you model these
conditioned zone without having to model the whole building?
5. Since I only need to study the load, do we still have to model the
HVAC? How can we find out the skin load?
 
Any inputs is greatly appreciated.
Thanks very much.

Hi Colleagues, 

I have here a group of 7 buildings in the same project. They are all
identical, except for orientation. 

The buildings are multifamily residential units, with 3 floors and a
basement each. They are existing buildings being renovated, and I am
wondering which version of LEED should apply (LEED for New Construction
and 
Major Renovations, LEED for Homes, ...)? 

Also, should I use ASHRAE 90.1 or ASHRAE 90.2 for the Baseline? 

Thanks.

I think that LEED-NC v2.2 (with ASHRAE 90.1-2004) would be the best
option, though obviously you are right on that border line between where
90.1 is appropriate. This is mostly based on my brief run through of the
LEED for Homes criteria, which I feel is better suited for single family
and town-home type settings (others may disagree with me on this). 

The other advantage of using this compliance path is that you can take
advantage of the "LEED-NC Application Guide for Multiple Buildings and
On-Campus Building Projects" which can save you A LOT of duplicate
effort in documenting a project with multiple, similar buildings (for
almost all credits, not just EAc1). Check out the application guide
using the search function on the USGBC website if the following link
does not work:

All - I responded to Paul privately to figure out this problem, and in the
interest of everyone getting the answer, am now sending my response to the
entire list.

 

The problem was that he was importing a "Glazing System" file from WINDOW5
rather than the "Window" (whole product) file from WINDOW5. 

 

So if you are want to import a file from WINDOW5 into EQuest, you need to
generate it from the Window Library -- click the Report button and specify
Report Type = DOE2, save that file under whatever name you wish, and then
import it into EQuest.

All:

 

There was a previous post on an issue of trying to import a WINDOW5 file
(glass assembly) *.txt file into eQuest resulting in a "Invalid U-value
Conditions - likely due to non-NFRC conditions being specified in the Window
program." error.  I have encountered this same error and haven't been able
to locate a remedy to this situation and I'm not sure that this error
translates into a known bug in the WINDOW5 software.

 

Any insight on how to correct this error or other work around would be
greatly appreciated.  Thanks in Advance

Hello Demba,
 
Since this building is three stories or less, then it falls under the ASHRAE 90.2 guidelines as residential multifamily building.  
This building would fall under the LEED for Homes guidelines.  Having said that, then this building would fall under the auspices of the Home Energy Rating System which uses the 2004 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) as a baseline.
 
I hope this helps,
 
Robert Salcido

The Baseline defined in LEED for New Construction and Major Renovations
is from 90.1. If I can't use 90.1, does that mean I am obliged to go
with LEED for Home (which does not use 90.2 at all, I think)? Any
thoughts?

I am lost (Friday afternoons don't help).

Appendix G notes that for the Baseline building: "Vertical fenestration
areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed
design or 40% of gross above grade wall area, whichever is smaller, and
shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four
orientations."
Does this mean that the Baseline building gets windows on all walls on
each orientation whether or not the Design case has a window in all
walls on each orientation.  For example, if the west orientation has 30%
glazing overall but many spaces have no windows - some walls on the west
face have more that 30%.  Do those spaces in the Baseline case get 30%
glazing?  Or do I only put windows in the Baseline case where there are
windows in the Design case.

shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four

orientations."

Does this mean that the Baseline building gets windows on all walls on

each orientation whether or not the Design case has a window in all

walls on each orientation.  For example, if the west orientation has 30%

glazing overall but many spaces have no windows - some walls on the west

face have more that 30%.  Do those spaces in the Baseline case get 30%

glazing?  Or do I only put windows in the Baseline case where there are

windows in the Design case.

 

Thanks for any help!

just adopted the base standard?

We are currently working on two dorm projects that fall into this gray
area of LEED. 

ASHRAE 90.2 is the appropriate standard for these types of buildings.
However, no reference to 90.2 is made in the LEED NC v2.2 manual. We
were told by a LEED NC course instructor that the buildings cannot be
certified under LEED NC v2.2. His reasoning is that since ASHRAE 90.1 is
not applicable, the buildings cannot meet EA prerequisite 2. 

Also, the LEED NC v2.2 manual states: 

"All commercial buildings, as defined by standard building codes, are
eligible for certification as a LEED for New Construction building.
Commercial occupancies include (but are not limited to) offices, retail
and service establishments, institutional buildings (libraries, schools,
museums, churches, etc.), hotels and residential buildings of four or
more habitable stories." 

Most standard building codes define 3 story dorms as residential
buildings.

The owners of our buildings have decided to register the projects in
order to get an official credit interpretation ruling from the USGBC. We
hope to have an official answer within the next few weeks.

Hi Colleagues, 

I have here a group of 7 buildings in the same project. They are all
identical, except for orientation. 

The buildings are multifamily residential units, with 3 floors and a
basement each. They are existing buildings being renovated, and I am
wondering which version of LEED should apply (LEED for New Construction
and 
Major Renovations, LEED for Homes, ...)? 

Also, should I use ASHRAE 90.1 or ASHRAE 90.2 for the Baseline? 

Thanks.

Jonathan-
Greetings.  I have a little experience in CHVAC and slightly more in eQuest, and here is my $0.02 worth.

If your objective is sizing equipment, developing detailed zone loads for system and equipment sizing, CHVAC is, in my opion the much better way to go.  I found it easy to set up zones, create systems, and the output is very well oraganized in terms of providing the design engineer with the information they need.

To try and do the same thing in eQuest is much more difficult and time consuming than CHAVC.  Furthermore, the program inputs outputs are focused on energy use.  The system sizing information is not as easy to locate and discern as in CHVAC.

Again, bare in mind I am new to both these programs.
This forum (Bldg-sim) will get you many other worthy opinions, I hope mine helps.

Regards and good luck.

Here is our perspective on the subject. 
 
Before there was LEED for Homes, you could use LEED NC for multi-unit residential projects  - and according to the LEED Guidelines for Lodging one should use 90.2 for residential buildings that were 3 stories or less. But that was then and this is now. So we agree if it is only residential with 3 stories or less than one must use LEED for Homes.
 
We still use LEED NC for mixed-use buildings of 4 stories or more that include some floors of residential. In this case, we follow 90.1 but follow the 90.1 "residential" aspects of the standard to characterize those floors of the building. 
 
The gray area for us these days is if it is mixed use of 3 stories or less.

The buildings are multifamily residential units, with 3 floors and a
basement each. They are existing buildings being renovated, and I am
wondering which version of LEED should apply (LEED for New Construction
and 
Major Renovations, LEED for Homes, ...)? 

Also, should I use ASHRAE 90.1 or ASHRAE 90.2 for the Baseline? 

Thanks.

Virdi,
1. Yes you can, although you'll have no diversity in this situation (but
that may not be important in your situation).
2. In either wizard, when defining the Building Footprint (screen 2, I
believe), Define a Footprint Shape larger than your zone, where you need
an interior wall (adiabatic) set up. When defining the Zoning Pattern,
do a custom zone that intersects exterior walls as needed and defines
interior walls. Leave the remainder of the Footprint Shape without a
zone and the wizard will set the proper wall types. You can verify how
it turned out in the 3D view.

Trane's TRACE700 and Carrier's HAP4 Energy programs can also be used independently for loads calculation.  The DOE2 based energy programs can be used but they are clumsy for loads.
Automated Procedures for Engineering Consultants (APEC) first released its Loads Program called Heating & Cooling Calculations (HCC) in 1966.  It has been updated over the years until around the early 1990s.  The last version is called HCC-V version 3.0.  HCC-V has a forms (not MS Windows) interface and is easy to use.  In my opinion this program is still good enough for design loads calculations which is used to size ducts, pipes and equipment.  
APEC was a consortium of M-E and A-E design firms that funded the development of M-E software.  Around 2004 APEC folded up.  I bought out the APEC Loads, Ducts & Pipes programs as mementos-souvenirs since I was involved in fixing bugs and providing customer support in 1969-70 - my first career job out of college.  The programs come with good supporting documentation.  The Ducts and Pipes programs are DOS based, and the network has to be defined with numbered sections.  They are not worth using since such programs should be CAD based.   
There are plans to put up the APEC HCC-V program for free download on a website.  
The problem is the program comes on two 3.5" diskettes.  Using a diskette drive (Drive-A) you insert Diskette-One and run "setup.exe" and then you get a message saying insert Diskette-Two into Drive-A.  I cannot get the program to install from Drive-C or from the CD drive by combining the the contents of both diskettes into one folder and running "setup.exe" because it still asks yo to insert Diskette-Two into Drive-A.  I tried sending the fully installed program to another computer but there is an error message (DLL) when you try to run it from the other computer.
Does anyone know how to fix this problem?  I can send you the contents of the two diskettes in two folders.  Those who have 3.5" diskette Drive-A (about $40 for an external drive) can copy the folders into two diskettes and install from Drive-A.  There are plans to put up other information (for educational purposes) on the website for free download.  This will include project case studies using DOE2.1E, eQUEST and other programs.

Hi Jonathan,

 

I also recommend using a good load calculation program for calculating the
loads.  Elite CHVAC seems to meet the criteria well and not be so
complicated that errors get introduced merely from confusion.  Load
calculation programs are designed for a different purpose than energy
modeling programs.  The design intent is to estimate the load on the
building at specific weather and internal conditions and be reasonably close
to the worst case load at those given conditions for the purpose of
selecting equipment.  An energy modeling program is designed to give results
that match the energy consumption of the building and thus is more focused
on a dynamic situation.  They might use TMY weather data that doesn't match
the % load exceedance that would be the goal of a load calculation (the
ASHRAE 97-1/2% and 2-1/2% conditions for example).  Often the program is
tweaked to get the result to match existing utility bills, or to model a
system that it was not programmed to handle.  There are a lot of dynamic
variables that cannot be precisely defined, such as occupancy patterns, mass
influence, lighting and equipment loads and schedules, and so on.  The
energy modeling programs thus need to be more complicated, and therefore are
more susceptible to errors from confusion, lack of systems understanding and
experience regarding inputs, or programming errors not yet fixed.  When
drawings are imported from a CAD program, there is even more potential for
input error as the black box tries to put that into the appropriate format
for a load calculation.

 

I would certainly be great to have programs that we have more confidence in
to perform both energy and load calculations.  I'm hopeful that soon that
will happen.  We sure could make good use of tools like that.

Jonathan-

Greetings.  I have a little experience in CHVAC and slightly more in eQuest,
and here is my $0.02 worth.

 

If your objective is sizing equipment, developing detailed zone loads for
system and equipment sizing, CHVAC is, in my opion the much better way to
go.  I found it easy to set up zones, create systems, and the output is very
well oraganized in terms of providing the design engineer with the
information they need.

 

To try and do the same thing in eQuest is much more difficult and time
consuming than CHAVC.  Furthermore, the program inputs outputs are focused
on energy use.  The system sizing information is not as easy to locate and
discern as in CHVAC.

 

Again, bare in mind I am new to both these programs.

This forum (Bldg-sim) will get you many other worthy opinions, I hope mine
helps.

 

Regards and good luck.

Jonathan,
 
There are several differences between load calculation and energy simulation
programs, some of which others have mentioned.  Some other differences
include:
 
Summer load calculations are done at the worst summer design conditions
(outdoor air temperature, outdoor humidity, solar gain, etc.), and all of
the internal gains are assumed to be on 100% (e.g., people, lights,
equipment, etc.).  Energy programs use schedules and may not have 100% of
the internal gains on during the peak summer conditions, thereby suggesting
smaller equipment sizes.
 
Winter load calculations are done at the worst winter design conditions
(outdoor air temperature, nighttime, etc.), and the internal gains are all
assumed to be 0% (e.g., no people, no lights, no equipment, etc.).  Energy
programs use schedules, and may not have 100% of the people, lights, and
equipment off during peak winter conditions.
 
Some load programs allow the user to add a safety factor to the heating and
cooling loads (not just the equipment size).  So the heating/cooling load in
your zone is increased, therefore your air supply cfm is increased, your AHU
is increased in size, your plant size is increased, etc.).  I don't know how
to do this directly in any of the energy analysis programs that I use.
 
Because of these and other differences, I have found that energy modeling
programs will give smaller equipment sizes than do load programs.  Engineers
typically error on the side of safety, and therefore they prefer to size
equipment for the worst possible scenarios as described above.  When I was
designing building mechanical systems, I would never count on 25% of the
lights being on at night when it's -20 degrees F outside so that I could
reduce my boiler size.  My loads program would give me a larger boiler,
whereas my energy modeling program would give me a boiler sized as if the
lights will be on.  Also, the local TMY2 weather file that I use for energy
modeling doesn't even have -20 degrees F as an outdoor air temperature, and
this is the temperature that many engineers use to design their heating
systems.  M loads programs allow the outdoor design conditions to be input
directly.
 
Load programs require much less input than energy programs, and generally
don't require any special knowledge, art, or workarounds.  Energy modeling
programs require much more input, require very specialized knowledge and
experience, and always require workarounds and creative inputs (art) to get
the correct results.
 
All that being said, Trane's Trace 700 program does an acceptable job of
being both a loads program and an energy analysis program, although it does
have strengths and weaknesses in both areas.  In Trace, when running loads,
you can disable the energy related inputs.  After you are satisfied that you
have the correct loads, then you can proceed to working on the energy
parameters and inputs.  You can easily switch between running loads only and
loads + energy at any time.

Hi Dan,

 

I would clarify two things.  First is that the load calculations are done,
or should be done, for the design condition, not the worst possible
condition plus safety factor.  For cooling that normally means the ASHRAE
97-1/2% condition; for heating, the 2-1/2% condition.  Some programs list
adjustments as safety factors, but there is really a higher purpose.  One is
a morning warm-up factor that allows night setback energy savings to be
realistically achievable.  Similarly, a cool-down factor can be applied to
the cooling load and comes into play often on Monday morning when the system
has been off over the weekend and the building mass has gotten quite warm.
If you can't cool it down, then you can't save as much energy by letting it
get or stay warm for as long prior to occupancy.  The warm-up and cool-down
factors are largely a function of the space mass (the greater the mass, the
larger the factor needed).  There is also the possibility of either adding
capacity for future building or process load additions or designing for the
ability to add the capacity in the future.  It is best to do that in a
modular way the does not penalize efficiency until the future load is
on-line.

 

Second is that load programs do have schedules for people, lighting,
appliances, and power equipment.  It is proper to set those realistically
for the highest anticipated conditions, but not higher.  If set higher, or
at 100%, then the result will have compounding additional capacity (safety
factors multiplied upon each other resulting in grossly over-sized systems).
Heating is traditionally treated differently in that internal loads are
normally not left on for the design condition.  It is possible to turn off
all lights and internal gains during a heating requirement.  Cooling is a
little different in that some loads are simply never all on at the same
time.  People move throughout the building and they also come and go, so
diversity factors are also appropriate.

 

I would expect, or at least want, a program that does both load calculation
and energy modeling to be able to account for morning warm-up and cool-down
(including after a power outage) by sizing the systems to have sufficient
reserve capacity to recover in a reasonable period of time (and have that
time adjustable).  It would need to consider building mass, and look at
setback/setup differentials vs. recovery time and reserve capacity.

demonstrate the following usage scenario for a campus with distributed
facilities:
1. Capture an existing facility layout, loads, and energy systems.
2. Plug-in parameters for alternative energy productions systems and energy conservation measures.
3. Communicate near term cost/benefits, and life-cycle cost/benefits for each alternative.


Just
looking to demonstrate the concept at this time.  Do I have to build
the baseline and simulation data; or, is there public eQuest files that
can help me?

Sounds like too much trouble. 

I'd use the 41 hourly files that come with the ASHRAE RP1093 test data. These are available from Mike Vaughn, Manager of research at ASHRAE. Or, the easiest thing to do is to take the published WD/WE profiles that come with the 1093 toolkit and plug them into EQUEST, as they are in BDL format (also BLAST and EP). Then scale to your utility bills. What you're trying to do is possible, but requires some serious computing. 

Robert Sonderegger gave a Seminar talk awhile back about this sort of analysis, which he has done for utilities to predict overload data on substation transformers -- not for the faint of heart. Others have done work in this area as well, including Hashem Akbari, and Jeff Hirsch.

It is not only the shading that needs to be considered...but the reflected solar off glass facades, work the Enermodal did for ASHRAE.

I would encourage everyone to think about a simple question 
when they are decided who to reply to when responding to a 
BLDG-SIM posting:

   Could my response be useful to others?

If the answer is yes, and I believe it almost always should 
be yes, please reply to the BLDG-SIM mailing list.  That way 
the effort you take to compose an answer can help even more 
people.  In addition, it keeps the conversation thread alive 
and may prompt a response that adds to your own understanding.

Historically, I decided to not use the reply-to header being 
the list address because of vacation messages. Many people 
use them and since they are automatic, they can cause a 
storm of messages.  That happened once and we don't want to 
see that again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Fixed Shades in Baseline Case
Message-ID: <006a01c861be$05db5580$2c01a8c0@rob>

Hello all,

 

Appendix G states that for the baseline building performance, "the building
shall be modeled so that is does not shade itself."  I interpret this to
mean that only shades that are part of the building should be removed in the
baseline case, and that any fixed shades not connected to the building (i.e.
trees or neighboring structures) should still be modeled in the baseline
case.  Is this a correct assumption, or should all sources of shading, such
as trees, be removed in the baseline case? 

 

Thanks for the help!

Appendix G notes that for the Baseline building: "Vertical fenestration

areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed

design or 40% of gross above grade wall area, whichever is smaller, and

shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four

orientations."

Does this mean that the Baseline building gets windows on all walls on

each orientation whether or not the Design case has a window in all

walls on each orientation.  For example, if the west orientation has 30%

glazing overall but many spaces have no windows - some walls on the west

face have more that 30%.  Do those spaces in the Baseline case get 30%

glazing?  Or do I only put windows in the Baseline case where there are

windows in the Design case.

Hello All,
 
Actually, addenda are now permitted, at the option of the design team.
In a memo released April 26, 2007, USGBC announced that approved addenda
are permitted, as long as your submittal states that addenda are used,
and that they are applied consistently:
 
"Project teams are responsible for notifying LEED reviewers of the use
of ASHRAE addenda utilized at the time of project documentation
submission. If a project team elects to use an addendum to an ASHRAE
Standard, this addendum must be applied to the entire LEED submittal."
 
See http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664
<http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=2664>  for the whole
memo.

I've reviewed all the 90.1-2004 addenda and don't see where vertical

fenestration requirement of "distributing uniformly in horizontal bands

across the four orientations" has been removed. Addenda "as" which

refers to this section doesn't remove either.

The requirement to  distribute fenestration uniformly in horizontal

bands across the four orientations has been removed from Appendix G in

the published Addenda Supplement to 90.1, 2004. See the ASHRAE website

for the supplement.

Appendix G notes that for the Baseline building: "Vertical fenestration

areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed

design or 40% of gross above grade wall area, whichever is smaller, and

shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four

orientations."

Does this mean that the Baseline building gets windows on all walls on

each orientation whether or not the Design case has a window in all

walls on each orientation.  For example, if the west orientation has 30%

glazing overall but many spaces have no windows - some walls on the west

face have more that 30%.  Do those spaces in the Baseline case get 30%

glazing?  Or do I only put windows in the Baseline case where there are

windows in the Design case.

 

Thanks for any help!

Hi All,

I'm trying to input some specialty schedules into the user library.  I
created the schedules in a previous project and would like to copy them to
the library.  I copied the following schedule from bdllib.dat, and just
appended "1" to the names to differentiate between the userlib.dat schedule
and bdllib.dat schedule.  The category "Occupancy Schd1" is showing up, but
without any items to choose from.  Any suggestions are appreciated.

Thanks,

~Karen~

The location of the document with this important modification may seem simple from the link. However the location is not at all obvious on the USGBC's "improved" website. On the LEED/LEED Rating Systems/LEED NC page, there is a link to a summary of our dear rating system, some posted errata, multi-building/campus guidelines, and a link to "Green Source Mag." A user would be forgiven if they thought this was a complete accounting of the system.

BUT, separately there is a LEED/LEED Resources (different than "Resources")/LEED Reference Documents page, where this memo resides along with the errata again. Nothing on the Rating Systems page indicates or links to this other page where this and some other important guidelines for EAc1 are located. This page should be linked to the rating systems page(s). 

The CIR page, obscurely located under "Project Certification," should also be linked to the rating system summary page(s). And the CIRs should be viewable by the public not just us members.

Happy Monday

Actually, the text you refer to means that the building itself, meaning
its own walls and roof, should not shade itself.  That sentence probably
sounds confusing.  Think of an L-shaped building and how one side of the
L could shade another side of the L at certain times of the day/year. 
If you're using DOE2, you can just use this code at the beginning of
where your spaces and surfaces are defined:
 
SET-DEFAULT FOR EXTERIOR-WALL
SHADING-SURFACE = NO ..
 
This is for your Baseline.  For your Proposed Design, change the "NO"
to a "YES."
 
App. G, Table G3.1 states that, for the baseline, "no shading
projections shall be modeled.  Manual window shading devices such as
blinds or shades shall not be modeled."  This means your baseline
shouldn't have any fixed shades in it.  For the proposed design, only
automatically controlled shades/blinds can be modeled, and any
"permanent shading devices such as fins, overhangs, and light shelves
may be modeled."
 
As far as the trees and shades/reflectance from neighboring buildings,
I haven't found this addressed in the LEED or App. G documentation.  Has
anyone else?
 
Hope this helps!

Hello all,
 
Appendix G states that for the baseline building performance, ?the
building shall be modeled so that is does not shade itself.?  I
interpret this to mean that only shades that are part of the building
should be removed in the baseline case, and that any fixed shades not
connected to the building (i.e. trees or neighboring structures) should
still be modeled in the baseline case.  Is this a correct assumption, or
should all sources of shading, such as trees, be removed in the baseline
case? 
 
Thanks for the help!

I couldn't find it either Kristin, as far as I read nothing about

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Exterior wall heat transfer in eQuest
Message-ID: <20080128174254.C593CFE9A@che.dreamhost.com>

Hello all,

 

I'm about to start working on a model for an existing classroom building.
The exterior walls are uninsulated concrete with a "corrugated" exterior
surface that would appear to me to greatly increase the effective surface
area for winter heat loss/summer heat gain.  Any thoughts about how to
approach modeling with this in eQuest?

 

Thanks,

 

Steven

Occasionally questions surface in this listserv relating to getting the Revit (3d BIM model) over to IES for energy analysis.  See http://greenbim.blogspot.com/2008/01/revit-archirtecture-to-ies-workflow.html for recent post on the subject.  Important to note that this post demonstrates Revit Architecture to IES through plug-in tools.  If you have Revit MEP, it is different.

This is an interesting one.  I gave it some thought a few years back  
when I came across precast concrete blades projecting outside  
(shades), but directly exposed to the outside.  I thought of using  
Therm to estimate the effective U-Value of the wall for winter heat  
loss purposes but didn't take it any further at the time.

The air gap between the corrugated metal and concrete provides a  
relatively significant level of insulation.  If your effective  
exterior surface area is say 1.3 of your projected surface area what  
you would ideally be able to do is raise your external heat transfer  
coefficient by the same or similar factor.  I don't know of a way to  
do this in DOE-2.2 other than modify surface roughness, but you could  
play with the cavity air-gap insulation value to derate the assembly  
but then this value does not vary with wind speed ... .  This would  
approximate only the modified convection effects.

As for solar radiation it should be similar as the corrugation would  
self shade and thus the wall always sees the projected area normal to  
the sun ... .  As for long wave radiative heat transfer you could max  
out the emissivity but this only gives you a 10-15% max increase  
given what the unmodified emissivity likely is.  Could you play with  
sky-view factors (I think you can vary them in 2.2) to increase the  
amount of sky a surface sees to account for the extended surface  
area .... ?

Good luck I would be interested if any of the forum participants have  
come across refereed papers in this area.  In parts of Australia the  
cold bridging created by a concrete blade or an aluminium curtainwall  
fin can be significant.  The latter is disturbingly common on non- 
thermally broken curtainwall suites.  I reckon the benefits of the  
shading could be outweighed by the unaccounted penalties ...

Graham

Graham,

 

Sorry if I wasn't clear.  The concrete has a corrugated exterior finish,
there is no metal layer.  It's a solid (with metal rebar embedded) concrete
wall.

Dear All,

I'm trying to model heat pumps with different SEER values (12, 13, 14,
16). I know that I need to edit the DX-Cool-EIR-fPLR part load curves
for each corresponding SEER value and was wondering if any of you had
tabled curve functions corresponding to different SEER values. Also, I
have been using the default EIR values that eQuest gives me (0.36).
Also, I don't know what type of curve function (cubic, linear,
quadratic, etc.) to use for the simulations that I am conducting. If any
of you have some words of wisdom, I'm all ears.

Thank you,

Hi All,

I'm trying to input some specialty schedules into the user library.  I
created the schedules in a previous project and would like to copy them
to the library.  I copied the following schedule from bdllib.dat, and
just appended "1" to the names to differentiate between the userlib.dat
schedule and bdllib.dat schedule.  The category "Occupancy Schd1" is
showing up, but without any items to choose from.  Any suggestions are
appreciated.

Thanks,

HI,
I had done a similar analysis. Instead of modifying part load curves,
what we ended up doing was taking out building loads from e quest,
using actual manufacturer data for different SEER units (Trane 12i,
14i etc) and making a spreadsheet model to calculate hourly
consumption.

Thanks

Message-ID: <A20D2461C10C5749B957B0D1F89D7121011841C4@graex1.graa.lcl>

Hello all.

I am fairly new to eQuest.  I am currently modeling an 800 sf
convenience store.  Envelope, Lighting, HVAC, and DHW components have
all been inputted.

I am having a hard time finding a way to input refrigeration in terms of
display cases.  The components are listed below:

(1) self-contained ice maker

(1) remote roof-top mid-temp condenser for:
	a 1 door cooler
	a sandwich case
	a 3 door cooler

(1) remote roof-top low-temp condenser for:
	a reach-in freezer

Currently I have these modeled as self contained units which cause
cooling needs in the summer.  When I take out these components all
together, I need cooling in the summer and tremendous space heating in
the winter.

If the heat is exhausted outside then the HVAC will only have to
compensate for the cooling?  Then how would the power requirements be
modeled?

Please let me know the best way to approach this.  I picked this as
small beginner project but do you think the refrigeration component
pushes this over my head?

Thanks.

Thanks Michael and all who replied.
 
The responses generally told me what I expected to here, that most
simulation software was not to the point yet where people were
comfortable in using it for load calculation and system sizing, with the
exceptions of Trace700 and Carrier's HAP4 as some have stated.
 
The following issues seemed to resonate strongest from the responses as
to why not to use software like DOE2 or eQUEST for sizing equipment:
1) Difficulty in setting up model (complicated, clumsy, more susceptible
to errors) and cumbersome organization of output
2) Model zoning generally combines similar HVAC zones and does not
require detailed zoning usually required in load calculations
(simulation models too detailed and will take too long to run)
3) TMY weather data is generally not representative of ASHRAE design
conditions
4) Schedules (occupant, lighting, equipment, etc.) for design conditions
and average representative conditions typical used in models are
different
5) There is optimism that software advances will help improve
capabilities in the future
 
For my $0.02:
 
1) I agree that for novice (or even many intermediate) users, you would
be asking for trouble if relying upon the results of a simulation model
for sizing equipment. Though your chances of success improve as you
learn to check, and double check the output, and interpret results.
2) Getting into a hundred+ zones in a building could be difficult to
manage, but for a Core and Shell building with block loads it should not
be excessively burdensome
3) eQUEST does allow for the creation of Design Day weather conditions
(directly adding to the .inp file is the only way I know how to do it
but there may be another way)
4) eQUEST also allows for Cooling Design Day schedules and Heating
Design Day schedules (again by adding to .inp file)
5) I too look forward to advances in the software that can take the
detail that goes into a model and gain more from it that just a few LEED
credits.
 
I have only spent little time looking at this in detail, and this
discussion has definitely been of great learning experience.

Hi Dan,

 

I would clarify two things.  First is that the load calculations are
done, or should be done, for the design condition, not the worst
possible condition plus safety factor.  For cooling that normally means
the ASHRAE 97-1/2% condition; for heating, the 2-1/2% condition.  Some
programs list adjustments as safety factors, but there is really a
higher purpose.  One is a morning warm-up factor that allows night
setback energy savings to be realistically achievable.  Similarly, a
cool-down factor can be applied to the cooling load and comes into play
often on Monday morning when the system has been off over the weekend
and the building mass has gotten quite warm.  If you can't cool it down,
then you can't save as much energy by letting it get or stay warm for as
long prior to occupancy.  The warm-up and cool-down factors are largely
a function of the space mass (the greater the mass, the larger the
factor needed).  There is also the possibility of either adding capacity
for future building or process load additions or designing for the
ability to add the capacity in the future.  It is best to do that in a
modular way the does not penalize efficiency until the future load is
on-line.

 

Second is that load programs do have schedules for people, lighting,
appliances, and power equipment.  It is proper to set those
realistically for the highest anticipated conditions, but not higher.
If set higher, or at 100%, then the result will have compounding
additional capacity (safety factors multiplied upon each other resulting
in grossly over-sized systems).  Heating is traditionally treated
differently in that internal loads are normally not left on for the
design condition.  It is possible to turn off all lights and internal
gains during a heating requirement.  Cooling is a little different in
that some loads are simply never all on at the same time.  People move
throughout the building and they also come and go, so diversity factors
are also appropriate.

 

I would expect, or at least want, a program that does both load
calculation and energy modeling to be able to account for morning
warm-up and cool-down (including after a power outage) by sizing the
systems to have sufficient reserve capacity to recover in a reasonable
period of time (and have that time adjustable).  It would need to
consider building mass, and look at setback/setup differentials vs.
recovery time and reserve capacity.

Jonathan,

 

There are several differences between load calculation and energy
simulation programs, some of which others have mentioned.  Some other
differences include:

 

Summer load calculations are done at the worst summer design conditions
(outdoor air temperature, outdoor humidity, solar gain, etc.), and all
of the internal gains are assumed to be on 100% (e.g., people, lights,
equipment, etc.).  Energy programs use schedules and may not have 100%
of the internal gains on during the peak summer conditions, thereby
suggesting smaller equipment sizes.

 

Winter load calculations are done at the worst winter design conditions
(outdoor air temperature, nighttime, etc.), and the internal gains are
all assumed to be 0% (e.g., no people, no lights, no equipment, etc.).
Energy programs use schedules, and may not have 100% of the people,
lights, and equipment off during peak winter conditions.

 

Some load programs allow the user to add a safety factor to the heating
and cooling loads (not just the equipment size).  So the heating/cooling
load in your zone is increased, therefore your air supply cfm is
increased, your AHU is increased in size, your plant size is increased,
etc.).  I don't know how to do this directly in any of the energy
analysis programs that I use.

 

Because of these and other differences, I have found that energy
modeling programs will give smaller equipment sizes than do load
programs.  Engineers typically error on the side of safety, and
therefore they prefer to size equipment for the worst possible scenarios
as described above.  When I was designing building mechanical systems, I
would never count on 25% of the lights being on at night when it's -20
degrees F outside so that I could reduce my boiler size.  My loads
program would give me a larger boiler, whereas my energy modeling
program would give me a boiler sized as if the lights will be on.  Also,
the local TMY2 weather file that I use for energy modeling doesn't even
have -20 degrees F as an outdoor air temperature, and this is the
temperature that many engineers use to design their heating systems.  M
loads programs allow the outdoor design conditions to be input directly.

 

Load programs require much less input than energy programs, and
generally don't require any special knowledge, art, or workarounds.
Energy modeling programs require much more input, require very
specialized knowledge and experience, and always require workarounds and
creative inputs (art) to get the correct results.

 

All that being said, Trane's Trace 700 program does an acceptable job of
being both a loads program and an energy analysis program, although it
does have strengths and weaknesses in both areas.  In Trace, when
running loads, you can disable the energy related inputs.  After you are
satisfied that you have the correct loads, then you can proceed to
working on the energy parameters and inputs.  You can easily switch
between running loads only and loads + energy at any time.

Hello All,

Would anyone out there like to share experiences or precautions in using
simulation models (particularly eQuest, DOE2.1e, EnergyPlus) for load
calculations? Any advantages/disadvantages, tricks, or warnings in using
these simulation models as opposed to dedicated load calculation
software like Elite's CHVAC? Any studies comparing the two?

 

Thanks,

Before you try to re-open the model try this first:

1) "Reset Camera"
2) Change from the Building Shell tab to any of the other tabs and then
click back into the Building Shell tab.
3) "Reset Camera" again.

That usually fixes it.

Message-ID: <83C0527DB301124DA259186C7039281201D83E4A@ptamel05>

Good discussion on this topic.
 
One final point: 
Most simulation programs assume that the building is heated up/cooled
down within the first hour of plant operation.  This leads to high
predicted loads during that first hour that would not occur in reality.
(in cold climates a 2 hour warm-up on Monday morning is not unusual)
 
So, it may be useful to filter out the first hour loads, and then
examine the distribution of the remaining loads to pick off the 97.5%
value.
 
Cheers, Steve.

Greetings-
I was running an EEM to add enthalpy economizing.  An input required is Outside Air Multiplier.  

If I enter the equivalent of 100% of design air flow, air flow is held constant at 100% during heating mode, driving up heating use.

Could someone explain how eQuest handles this input?

I cannot comment on Energy+.  However, as far as eQUEST, I've modeled a
natatorium (indoor pool) including the latent load.  In one of the
ASHRAE books, there's a methodology for determining the latent loads of
a pool as a function of activity, water temperature, and I believe a few
other factors.  I ran through these calculations and inputted this load
into the "Internal Energy Sources" under the Equipment internal gains
tab.  I created a schedule based on when the proposed pool cover would
be off (pool in use), and called it a "process" load. I believe I set
the Latent HG ratio to 1.0 and Sensible to 0.
 
The results of my model seemed to be reasonable.  
 
Maybe with this methodology, it might allow you figure something out
with Energy+; otherwise, eQUEST may be your best, closest approximation,
for this project.

Dusko, 

 

That's also the methodology I followed for a recent project in eQuest. 

You can find an equation for the evaporation rate in the ASHRAE
Applications Handbook. Another source is 
http://www.rlmartin.com/rspec/whatis/index.html.

 

Hope this helps.

The evaporation has a cooling effect that needs to be accounted for with
a sensible source load in the model.

Hi,

Is it possible to model swimming pool in Energy+? I could not find the
way to model latent loads due to water evaporation



Thanks

Greetings-
I am preplxed by a dramtic increase in heating load for my building- 35000 sq ft two story office.

Base case equipment is Packaged Single Zone DX, fixed outside air (15%).  Base board perimeter radiators to heat.

The Propsed Case is Packaged Multizone with HW heat.  I added economizers, and kept the same baseboard.

The base case condtion used 183 MMBTU/year.
The revised model consumes 3338 MMBTU/year.

Space temperatures looked slightly different, but with in 2F-5F

Any thoughts?  All things are identical expect the RTUs.  I have checked everything I could think off.

Hello all again.

I've imported a CAD drawing, using schematic design mode I drew the
custom foot print and then the custom individual zones. I have a couple
of exterior walls that show up as interior walls, even after a lot of
tweaking. Any suggestions for converting these interior walls to
exterior walls (simply)?

Thanks again.

Jessica,
 
I believe that in the eQUEST wizard if your defined zone walls are even
the slightest bit off from what you defined as the building footprint,
they will not be recognized as exterior walls. You could go through the
wizard to correct this, create a new exterior wall in the detailed
design mode and delete the interior wall, or go to the .inp file to
change the wall type. You can't easily change a wall type from interior
to exterior within eQUEST.

I don't know if anyone has used it for modeling swimming pools, but
EnergyPlus does provide a way of specifying water uses.  If you know and
can schedule the water temperature and evaporation rates, that can be
used as input for a Water Use Equipment object with a latent fraction of
1.0.  The modeling accounts for both sensible and latent effects of
evaporation related to cooling, zone humidity, integrated interactions
with HVAC, etc.

How many zones are there, and are there the same number of single-zone
AHUs in your base case?  How are the baseboards controlled?

 

5,229 btu/sf/yr is pretty low for heating, depending on your climate.
The other figure may be high for an office (again depending on climate)
but looks to be the right order of magnitude if there is significant
cold weather.

 

I would start with the SS-O reports, and also compare the total number
of unmet hours for both cases, to verify that you are providing the same
conditions for each alternative.

 

That level of difference between the alternatives sounds more like the
first case has cooler than expected zones rather than the result of a
system type change (even to a multizone).

It is my understanding that if the wall of your custom zone is within 1'
of the footprint, then an exterior wall is created.  This can be useful if
you do not want exterior walls (where building connects to an adjacent
building for example).  You simply define your zone inside the floorplate
for that wall.  It can also be frustrating if your zone walls don't quite
line up with your floorplate as Jonathan suggested.  We tend to go through
the exercise of rounding all polygon vertex inputs to the nearest foot for
ease of zone alignment etc.  (That would be a helpful automatic option in
the eQUEST interface).

Jessica-

You can edit the .input file to change a wall from exterior to interior and
vise-versa

1) You would need to change the tag from "EXTERIOR-WALL" to "INTERIOR-WALL"
2) Change the construction.
3) Take out the shading surface tag if you have that specified for the
exterior wall.
4) You will also need to add a tag like {NEXT-TO = "Space that Its next to"}

Its tedious but if its only a few walls it shouldn't be that bad.

"Name of Wall" = INTERIOR-WALL
   NEXT-TO          = "Space its next to"
   CONSTRUCTION     = "IWall Construction"
   LOCATION         = SPACE-V2
   ..

"Name of Wall" = EXTERIOR-WALL
   CONSTRUCTION     = "EWall Const"
   LOCATION         = SPACE-V5
   SHADING-SURFACE  = YES
   ..

Thanks Dave-
I modeled a single zone (the floor) and a single RTU.  I did not notice any independant method for controlling the base board.  I assumed it worked off the setpoint on the HVAC system screen.

I checked SS-K and I was getting temperature drop with out the HW coil and overshoot with the hot water coil.

Irene:

Robin Mitchell from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was gracious
enough to previously help me with somewhat of the same question.

Import a file from WINDOW into Bequest using a "Glazing System" file
from WINDOW rather than the "Window" (whole product) file from WINDOW.

You need to generate this file from the Window Library -- click the
Report button and specify Report Type = DOE, save that file under
whatever name you wish, and then it is ready for import it into Bequest.

In the detailed mode of bequest, go to the BUILDING SHELL icon, scroll
down to 'Glass Types' on the left side and right click on the 'Import a
Window 4/5 Report file...'

Hopefully this helps.

Hello,

I would like to import a WINDOW 5 file into eQUEST, but I'm not sure how
to do it and what format it needs to be exported as.  Any pointers would
be greatly appreciated.

Hi Paul,

I don't understand what you mean by:

 "import a file from Window into EQuest using a "Glazing System" file
from WINDOW rather than the "Window" (whole product) file from WINDOW

When you then go on to say: " click the
Report button and specify Report Type = DOE"

If you try to report a glazing system it will only allow you to do this
as a "detailed" report. Whereas the "Window" (whole product) allows you
to do the DOE report!

I'm trying to do this too and it doesn't seem to work. I have done it
before but I don't seem to be able to do it again!

Kind Regards,
Kevin

Robin Mitchell from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was gracious

Import a file from WINDOW into Bequest using a "Glazing System" file
from WINDOW rather than the "Window" (whole product) file from WINDOW.

You need to generate this file from the Window Library -- click the
Report button and specify Report Type = DOE, save that file under
whatever name you wish, and then it is ready for import it into Bequest.

In the detailed mode of bequest, go to the BUILDING SHELL icon, scroll
down to 'Glass Types' on the left side and right click on the 'Import a

Hopefully this helps.

Kevin:

Sorry for the confusion.

1. )  In WINDOW, click on 'Libraries' at the top and then click on
(check mark) 'Window F2'

2.)  Once the window system has been developed, click on the 'REPORT'
icon on the left side and then make sure that the Report Type is 'DOE-2'

3.)  Give this file a unique name and it will be ready for import into
eQuest.

Again, sorry for the confusion on the previous e-message.

My understanding (from some long-forgotten reference, possibly authoritative, possibly not) has always been that the evaporative cooling effect accrues to the pool itself and the pool heater offsets it, and I have not modeled as a cooling load in/to the space. But I could imagine that part of that evaporation does cool the space.

I cannot comment on Energy+.  However, as far as eQUEST, I've modeled a natatorium (indoor pool) including the latent load.  In one of the ASHRAE books, there's a methodology for determining the latent loads of a pool as a function of activity, water temperature, and I believe a few other factors.  I ran through these calculations and inputted this load into the "Internal Energy Sources" under the Equipment internal gains tab.  I created a schedule based on when the proposed pool cover would be off (pool in use), and called it a "process" load. I believe I set the Latent HG ratio to 1.0 and Sensible to 0.
 
The results of my model seemed to be reasonable.  
 
Maybe with this methodology, it might allow you figure something out with Energy+; otherwise, eQUEST may be your best, closest approximation, for this project.

I'm not sure how it breaks down between pool load and air load, but I
think it is part of the building heating load in either case.

FYI



You'll find useful information about modeling this in the paper:

 

Haberl, J., Claridge, D. 1985. "Retrofit Energy Studies of a Recreation
Center," ASHRAE Transactions-Research, Vol. 91, Pt. 2, pp. 1421 - 1433
(June). 

 

There have also been a number of papers written on calculating the
incoming/outgoing heat transfer from the pool surface, including one by
Francis DeWinter (1980s, Atlas Corp.), and there is a useful reference
method in the FCHART manual.

Hi,

Is it possible to model swimming pool in Energy+? I could not find the
way to model latent loads due to water evaporation



Thanks

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Switch Glazing
Message-ID: <335773.89767.qm@web32614.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear All,
  Has anyone had success with the Switch Glazing feature in Equest.
  My model crashed 95% of the time as soon as I assigned a glazing for the switch mode.
  For some reason it did not crash in a simple test model I had created one time, but later on it did.
  Any comments would be very helpful.
  Best Regards,
  Kapil.
