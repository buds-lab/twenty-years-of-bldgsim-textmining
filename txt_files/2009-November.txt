I am performing mechanical design and energy modeling for an existing dormitory renovation in upstate NY. There is a concrete crawlspace with ground contact that I think could be used to preheat/precool makeup air. I have checked the Bldg-sim archives but have not found any design guides or recommendations for using existing crawlspaces/basements as earth tubes. We?d be cutting through concrete structural walls to build something so I need to do some homework to justify it. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Message-ID: <AA9B9F375669B94D9634E480F2EC721C06A6C354@ossa.TWGI.com>

Hello,
While working with EPW weather files recently, I noticed that the file
format has changed within the past 2 months. I compared two files for
the same location I had downloaded a month apart (September and October
2009). The October file has 3 new columns of information. Does anyone
know what that additional information is? A updated list of headers
would be nice too.  
 
This format change would affect some third party programs like Climate
Consultant 4 (and maybe Ecotect/ weather tool) which use EPW file input.

Thanks.

All,

Like Tim, I am trying to follow Randy's instructions for converting TMY3 
files for use in eQuest, and getting hung up at step 3. I am attempting 
to use EnergyPlus's converter - I downloaded and installed EnergyPlus 
today (version 4.0), which came with Version 1.4.11 of the Weather 
Converter.

It seems that the only output formats the EnergyPlus weather converter 
provides are the EnergyPlus weather format (EPW), a CSV format of EPW 
data, both EPW and CSV, and a statistics report on input data.

I don't see any way to create a binary (.bin) file.

Any suggestions or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Greg

Greg, 

You need to use the DOE2 converter to create the .bin file. The file is
located here: http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html#eQ_WthProc

 

Be careful with the location of the files as you convert and make sure
to read the txt file that is included with the zip package.

 

Sam

FYI.

We tried to simulate this back in 1985 with DOE-2 by forcing the loads to equal measured amounts and got somewhat close. Measured data included the pool evaporation rate and ice rink refrigeration load. This was published in an ASHRAE Transactions paper.

Also, there are some papers published on predicted evaporation rates from exposed pools. Several are listed in the apx to the FCHART manual.

Otherwise, you can guess.

Larry,
 
I've modeled a natatorium in TRACE but it shouldn't be a problem in
eQUEST. The pool is a latent load on the space and also a water heating
load. You will need to know/select the water temperature, space
temperature, space humidity and ventilation rate. I suggest using the
ASHRAE Handbook - Applications p4.6 for guidance, as well as product
literature for natatorium air handling systems. For water heating, you
will have to make up the latent load as well as account for
emptying/refilling the pool for regular cleaning.

Bill

Using IES

The approach I recommend for modelling gains from swimming pools is as follows. 1. Sensible heat gain. Represent the body of water as a room, maintained at a constant temperature. Represent the surface of the water as a window, consisting of a single pane with properties: transmittance=1, absorptance=0, reflectance=0, refractive index=1. This takes care of the sensible gain from the pool to the space above it. The software will of course generate a load for heating the pool, which you can either use or ignore depending on the aim of the study. You will need to set a low surface resistance for the construction representing the downward-facing side of the surface. Do this is APcdb by unticking the default box for either Inside or Outside Surface Resistance (as explained below) and typing in the value 0.01 m2K/W. You need to decide whether the downward-facing side is ?inside? or ?outside? by applying the convention that the inside surface is the one
 facing the room that appears first on the ModelIT browser. When you?ve made this change you?ll see surface temperatures close to those for the pool water. 3. Latent heat gain. Evaporation of pool water constitutes a latent gain to the space above. The software will not calculate this for you, but you can estimate it. An accurate estimate of this gain would take account of the vapour pressure difference between the pool (saturated) and the air, as well as the area of the pool surface (corrected for waves) and the area of wetted surfaces around it. Some of these parameters are difficult to estimate, and I recommend you use figures provided by equipment manufacturers. A number of these can be found on the web, and this one from Desert Aire is useful (see Table 3): www.desert-aire.com/pdf/AN/an10.pdf

Larry,
 
I?ve modeled a natatorium in TRACE
but it shouldn?t be a problem in eQUEST. The pool is a latent load on the
space and also a water heating load. You will need to know/select the water
temperature, space temperature, space humidity and
ventilation rate. I suggest using the ASHRAE Handbook - Applications p4.6 for
guidance, as well as product literature for natatorium air handling systems. For
water heating, you will have to make up the latent load as well as account for emptying/refilling
the pool for regular cleaning.

Bill

FYI. 

We tried to simulate this back in 1985 with DOE-2 by forcing the loads to equal
measured amounts and got somewhat close. Measured data included the pool
evaporation rate and ice rink refrigeration load. This was published in an
ASHRAE Transactions paper. 

Also, there are some papers published on predicted evaporation rates from
exposed pools. Several are listed in the apx to the FCHART manual. 

Otherwise, you can guess.

This topic appears to be a gray area within eQUEST.  Has anyone been able to successfully model a Ground Source Water-to-Water HP connected to a closed loop Geothermal Well Field?

The WWHP is to serve a radiant floor.  In addition to the WWHP, the design also has multiple Water-to-Air Heat Pumps connected to the same well field.  Issues rise when trying to figure out how to model the effect of the WWHP on the Well Loop.

In the past I have used the Loop-to-Loop Chiller to model a WWHP, but the chiller requires a connection to a Lake-Well type loop.

Thanks in advance.

I believe the methodology that has been implemented with success is to
use the WTW HPs with the lake well, but to use a schedule for well water
temperatures either taken from a separate run with WTA and closed loop,
or to take the temperatures from another yearly sim in either GLHE-PRO
or GS2000.

That's pretty much what I've done for a few projects.

 

1.       Calc your loads incident on the loop, either using eQuest or
another program

2.       Use those loads to determine the annual thermal behavior of the
ground loop using a program like the free GS2000 or a similar
ground-loop design tool.

3.       Use the thermal behavior output of your ground-loop software of
choice to create a custom temperature schedule.  If you want a more
detailed explanation of the step-by-step process within eQuest, search
for my name in the eQuest/Bldgsim archives.

If you don't want to use outside programs to estimate the ground heat
exchanger response, you can input the condenser loads directly into the
ground heat exchanger water loop as a process load.  

 

For GSHP's, just make sure you're using heat of extraction spec data for
your condenser loads, not total heating capacity.

 

Integrating the loads from multiple systems (DHW, Bldg, et. al.) into a
single GHX also yields a more cost effective (fewer bores) GHX from an
installation perspective.

The variable being tracked (mixed air humidity ratio) is supposedly a valid

Shaun,

I think you're calling for a hourly value that is computed only when the
system is on. Check the system part-load-ratio to confirm. If you really
need the humidity ratio during those hours, you can take the outdoor HR
but you might need to adjust for the hourly latent heat gain.

So, what constitutes the system being ON?  Every hour from March to Dec
reports a non-zero value, which suggests that a cycling system is considered
ON. Is it possible it takes from Jan through the end of Feb for the
simulation to stabilize?

I'll check the part-load, maybe there is some threshold before a value is
given.

Shaun,

I think you're calling for a hourly value that is computed only when the
system is on. Check the system part-load-ratio to confirm. If you really
need the humidity ratio during those hours, you can take the outdoor HR but
you might need to adjust for the hourly latent heat gain.

Shaun,

In DOE-2 lexicon, ON means there was a load requiring the system to be 
turned on at some point during that hour, the amount is indicated by the
part-load-ratio, 1.0 meaning completely on, 0.0 meaning completely off 
that hour. I'm sure the hourly cycling you're seeing is NOT for the
simulation stabilizing. I have seen such cycling on occasion, but
mostly with ventilation, not heat pump operations. What did you put
for the throttling range?

One thing that will hopefully be spurred by the ASHRAE BEMP certification is availability of training for energy modelers which should help in your question about quality of modeling.  Your concern there isn't limited to South Africa!

Perhaps South Africa might also provide some default weather files similar to those used for simulations in the climate zones of California for use in this compliance exercise?  I'm not personally familiar enough with the climate in South Africa to know how many standard weather files would be enough to cover the country adequately.  That could remove one variable from the process to maintain quality.

Material libraries for several simulation programs shouldn't be that hard either unless there is some great variance from what people are using in other locations.

If this becomes mandatory I fear that the simulations will in general be of low quality, leading to simulation eventually being discredited. This country has very little weather data, almost no materials data, and very few trained Building Physicists.

Can IBPSA Members offer any advice ?

Message-ID: <001501ca5d44$6977ab10$3c670130$@cubillas@uca.es>

 

 

I will be very gratefully for any help.

 

I?m a researcher in the University of Cadiz (Spain). We?re studying how
DOE-2 carry out the simulation for Fancoils and Chillers systems. We need to
know the relation between the capacities and the air entering temperatures
(wet bulb and dry bulb), and water entering temperatures. The simulations
proceed of cases that have a Chiller enough powerful to attend the fancoils
demand has been concluded. The conclusions have been reached with different
simulations and tests. All these cases, show that, curiosity, fancoils?
total and sensible capacities  are not depended of water entering
temperatures. In all these cases is easy to calculate the capacities (they
are the product between nominal capacities and air entering temperatures
functions). The fancoil power, logically, is the same that the product of
the capacity and the PLR. The outside temperatures of air and water, are
calculated with this power, and the power that the chiller gives is a bit
bigger that the fancoil power needed, and is the same that  the Net hourly
loop load (including thermal losses). Every equation looks closed and
logical (except the fact that the capacity calculation, in those cases, is
not function of water entering temperatures, but the calculations and tests
confirm that).

 

Our problems merge when chiller is not enough big to attend the fancoils
demand, then some calculation relations change. Now the fancoil power is not
the logical product between the capacity and the PLR, and the capacity is
not the product of the nominal value and the air entering temperatures
function. Maybe now, in this cases, the water entering temperatures will be
considered in the fancoil capacities calculation in some way, but we haven?t
found any logical relation to explain how it?s working.  DOE-2 have a
function that modifies the capacities in function of water entering
temperature and air wet bulb temperatures. We are trying to find a relation
between this function and the capacities calculation in this cases, but we
haven?t found anything at the moment. In addition, for Fancoil PLR minor
that 1 the fancoil power continues coinciding with the load on loop, and the
chiller power is a bit bigger that this, being the same that the Net Hourly
loop load. However, for fancoil PLR equals to 1, not even these relations
are correct.

 

Someone could give some information about the way in that eQuest works when
the chiller is not enough big to attend the fancoils demand?

Any help will be very useful.

 

Thank you very much in advance to everybody.

My understanding (from very unofficial sources found while googling) is
that when units are tested per ARI 210/240 (or 340/360), they are tested
with a clean filter and minimal ductwork (total static of around 0.3").
Thus, you would need to back this minimal amount of energy from the EER,
and then add the actual fan energy.

If you simply use the rated EER with no adjustment, and set your supply
fan energy to zero, (as was recommended in the archives), then you will
significantly underestimate your fan energy.

So, is anyone familiar with the ARI 210/240 or 340/360 tests, and know
how much fan energy is included in these tests?  Also, is the included
fan energy different for packaged units vs. split systems?

Thanks,



Jim

Is there a generally acceptable way to model CO2 demand ventilation 
control for a LEED C&S project?

On other LEED projects (not Core & Shell), I have used the occupancy 
schedule to set the outdoor air flow.

eQuest can model demand-control ventilation in a few ways, without you
having to define a custom schedule.  There are two options for
MIN-OA-CONTROL... everything is do-able through the detailed interface
(maybe the wizards too, can't recall), without jumping into the .inp
file.

 

Following is a copy/paste from the DOE2 help file giving the full
behavioral explanation:

 

DCV-RETURN-SENSOR This codeword instructs the program to model a DCV
device that uses a CO2 differential between the SYSTEM return air stream
and OA intake air stream to determine the hourly minimum OA fraction.
The program calculates the OA minimum requirement and sets the minimum
damper position hourly based upon the sum of the ZONE requirements. Each
zone OA requirement is calculated based upon the hourly maximum of
either OA-CFM/PER (times the NUMBER-OF-PEOPLE adjusted by the hourly
PEOPLE-SCHEDULE) or a minimum OA ventilation rate. The zone minimum OA
ventilation rate is either MIN-OUTSIDE-AIR if specified or the maximum
of OA-CHANGES (times the zone VOLUME/60), OA-FLOW/AREA (times the zone
AREA.)

 

DCV-ZONE-SENSORS   This codeword instructs the program to model a DCV
device that uses the highest CO2 differential between the each ZONE air
and OA intake air stream to determine the hourly minimum OA fraction.
The program calculates the OA minimum requirement and sets the minimum
damper position hourly using the "critical" zone requirement; the
critical zone requirement is defined as the zone having the highest
fraction of OA relative to its hourly supply air flow rate. Each zone OA
requirement is calculated based upon the hourly maximum of either
OA-CFM/PER (times the NUMBER-OF-PEOPLE adjusted by the hourly
PEOPLE-SCHEDULE) or a minimum OA ventilation rate. The zone minimum OA
ventilation rate is either MIN-OUTSIDE-AIR if specified or the maximum
of OA-CHANGES (times the zone VOLUME/60), OA-FLOW/AREA (times the zone
AREA.). The value of the zone minimum OA ventilation flow rate is
divided by the specified/calculated zone supply flow to calculate hourly
zone OA fraction; the zone with the highest hourly flow fraction value
is the "critical" zone.  Setting the sum of the ZONE OA flow
requirements divided by the system total supply fan flow to X, and
letting the critical zone OA fraction be denoted as Z, the system hourly
minimum OA flow fraction is then X/(1+X-Z)

Actually I wold expect the ARI testing to be done with 0.5" of static,
which is normally the "rated" static anyway.

I don't see any need to call this "significantly underestimating" the
energy use.  If you design to 0.5" of static, you're good to go.

The Standard is available on the AHRI Web site at
http://ari.org/Content/FindaStandard_218.aspx?Listing_PK=143

All fan energy must be included and that is calculated using a minimum
external static pressure that varies with capacity (See Table 5)

Hello All,

 

I am working on LEED NC v2.2, I have a question related to Energy modeling.

 

What is the Fenestration Visible Light Transmittance (Tvis) value should be
taken in Basecase? It will be appreciated if you provide me the reference.

 

Thanks in Advance,

 

Ashraf, LEED AP

I think visible transmittance value doesn't matter whatever it is in the
base case, if we are following Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1 for energy modeling
for LEED NC v 2.2.
Visible transmittance of fenestration does not affect the energy consumption
since daylight sensors are not modeled in the base case.

Surekha Tetali

Dear all:

We?re currently working with DOE 2.2 v 4.2, and we find that when we try to
define a chiller control sequence, when we simulate, none of the two
available chillers is working.

We copy here the *.inp paragraphs corresponding to cool loop and control
definition, just in case somebody can give us a clue about it.


$ ---------------------------------------------------------
$              Circulation Loops

"Circuito AGUA FRIA" = CIRCULATION-LOOP
   TYPE             = CHW
   COOL-EQUIP-CTRL  = "CONTROL"


$ ---------------------------------------------------------
$              Equipment Controls

   "CONTROL"        = EQUIP-CTRL
   TYPE             = COOLING
   CIRCULATION-LOOP = "Circuito AGUA FRIA"
   CHILLERS-1       = ( "p1","p2" )

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Survey about architectural practice and envelope design
Message-ID: <927a3ea80911050618h104a34b3l7d6234295a35adc1@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,


As part of my doctoral research, I would appreciate very much if you could
participate in this survey about architectural design practice and envelope
design. My research aims to integrate several thermal simulation tools
within the design process. The ?designerly simulation? process aims to solve
envelope design dilemmas during all design phases.

In combination with design observation procedures, the results of this
survey should support the elaboration of early simulation propositions,
which will be tested in real designs and architectural firms. As the focus
of the research is on architectural practice and envelope design, this
survey is directed to architects (designers, researchers and professors) and
design consultants.

The survey has 14 required questions and 10 optional questions (the duration
is 9-12 minutes). If you want to clarify your answer, you can use the
?comments? box under some questions. If you have any doubts or related
interests, please don?t hesitate to contact me.

Once you completed the survey, I ask you to spread this e-mail to
architects, architecture firms, consultants or related lists of discussion.


You can access the survey via:

The Standard is available on the AHRI Web site at
http://ari.org/Content/FindaStandard_218.aspx?Listing_PK=143

All fan energy must be included and that is calculated using a minimum
external static pressure that varies with capacity (See Table 5)

Actually I wold expect the ARI testing to be done with 0.5" of static,
which is normally the "rated" static anyway.

I don't see any need to call this "significantly underestimating" the
energy use.  If you design to 0.5" of static, you're good to go.

Thanks for the link, James.  

I still have never seen a reliable method of converting a code-listed
unitary performance value to condensing section EIR.  

Based on my past work evaluating installed energy efficiency measures where
savings were based on installing high efficiency custom built RTUs rather
than code-compliant unitary RTUs, most savings arise from reduced internal
pressure drops and improved fan efficiencies.  The downfall of the analyses
that I reviewed, if you are wondering, is an approach that can be summarized
as follows:
  Annual ton-hrs * 12 ? (Base Avg Unitary EER - Proposed Avg Unitary EER)

It seems that many off-the-shelf RTUs have fan efficiencies that hover
around 55% while custom units have fan efficiencies that are around 65%.
Custom units tend to have larger coils with lower pressure drops.

Simply knowing the external static pressure during standard testing
conditions is not going to get you to a performance value for the condensing
unit if you do not also know the specific internal pressure drops or fan
efficiency.

What to assume for the generic code case fan power?  For what it is worth,
my rule of thumb is to knock ~0.20 kW/ton off the unitary EER rating.

Message-ID: <650A88AAC9704F4B8213E0B49F1D3E980C6438@exc02sfo1us.us.wspgroup.com>

Hi Guys,

 

I am using energypro to comply with California's Title 24 Code. I am
having some issues with trying to correctly model the external shading.

 

My building has the following irregular shading elements resulting in
these problems:

*         Horizontal shading using fritted glass - I can't specify the
material used in the external shading. Is it possible to make a ledge
around the building made out of glass?

*         External corridor which shades the windows - There are
horizontal as well as vertical elements to this, however the only
vertical element I can find is side fins. Could I draw these in?

 

There seems to be no option to

Message-ID: <f71ad0a60911070728r4df6df82kd5bc98117ea5806@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I am using open studio for comparing performance (which form is better) of
various building forms for a design project.
I am facing a problem in rendering the 3D model of various forms. In data
source, rendering setting, when I browse, it ask for .*eso* file. Second
thing is run period. How to proceed further in this. Also I am not getting
any tutorial to solve this.

Thanks in Advance

Hi Rachit, could you give a little more information about what you are trying to do?  OpenStudio displays the EnergyPlus geometry input from the idf file and allows you to edit it from the SketchUp interface, the data rendering mode is for coloring zones/surfaces using simulation results from the eso file.  RunPeriod selects the time period you want to run the simulation for.  For an OpenStudio tutorial please see this message:

http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=07186B30C3DFE948B0EE2862AC1999F709FB7EDFB6%40MAILBOX2.nrel.gov&forum_name=openstudio-support

You can post OpenStudio specific questions to the OpenStudio support list:

Thanks a lot,
Dan

Hi?All,

I?want to?model naturally ventilated cavity wall (with about 100mm thick brick wall as external leaf) in DesignBuilder. Does someone know of a way to do it? Or alternatively, is it possible to model the cavity in EnergyPlus and then to bring the model back to DB?

I'd be very?grateful for any help.

All,
Please check this info.  The quoted density is less than 
fiberglass.  Mud phuska is a mix of clay and wood shavings (right?), 
so the density should be > 500 kg/m3.  Solid wood is around 500, soil 
is 1500 - 1900.  The conductivity and specific heat are more plausible.

I am working on a project in which we are trying to get the full tax
incentive of $1.80/sf.  The lighting and envelope are pretty easy to
figure, but I'm confused on the heating and cooling portion.  You have
to be 20% less than ASHRAE 90.1.  Well I have modeled the building in
eQuest with the units we used and again with the units ASHRAE 90.1
recommends for the baseline.  Do I need to be 20% lower than the gas and
electrical demands, or a combined 20% between the two.  Thanks for your
help.

Matt, each case will be based on whole-building utility costs for natural gas and electricity, combined.

You may also want to combine the three scenarios into one set of simulations rather than thee partially qualifying sets of simulations if you are applying for the full amount.

Hello All,
I am totally new to ESP-r and I was going through the tutorial that's available on ESP-r website. I was wondering if any one of you has any other material I can go through to understand the start to finish of modeling in ESP-r that is easy to understand. For example: Step by Step process on how to construct a total model and how to read the results.
Thanks,

2nd Announcement of Call for Submissions and Sample Dataset Paper
Symposium on Simulation for Architecture and Urban Design at the 2010 Spring Simulation Conference (SimAUD<http://www.simaud.org/>).
[cid:image001.png at 01CA6191.87B022A0]


The SimAUD 2010 Committee is pleased to announce the 2nd Call for Submissions to the new Symposium on Simulation for Architecture and Urban Design, offering a venue for architecture researchers and simulation researchers to come together to focus on this important area. Buildings are the largest consumers of energy responsible for 48% of all Green House Gas emissions and due to the complexity and multidisciplinary aspects of architecture design and construction, and urban design and society, modeling and simulation become valuable techniques to understand and optimize this enormous challenge. Scientists, engineers, managers, educators, and students who develop or use simulation tools are invited to participate and present original papers.
SimAUD is where the Architecture community meets the Simulation community, as well as the UbiComp, Design, HCI, InfoViz and Computer Graphics communities. We are also interested in research from related fields as they apply to the built environment.
All submissions are peer-reviewed and considered for selection by the Committee. All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library<http://www.acm.org/dl>. The conference is run in collaboration with ACM/SIGSIM and is sponsored by The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.
We invite research works in several categories:

*         Papers & Notes

*         Data Sets (with Note)

*         Video Showcase (with Extended Abstract)


Sample Dataset Note: As the concept of a Data Set submission is new, we present an invited Data Set paper to show the intended content. The invited data set is from the Digital 210 King<http://www.digital210king.org> project and contains a detailed 3D building model. Of course, other data set types will be quite different so please add or remove sections as appropriate. Also, in addition to the submitted short paper for a data set, we expect the data set files to be quite large so please do not attempt to submit the actual data set files through the online paper submission system.
Download Sample PDF (395 KB)<http://www.simaud.org/downloads/210KingDataSet.pdf>

For submission details, please see the online CFP page<http://www.simaud.org/callforsubmissions.php>.
For further information, please see the conference website at www.simaud.org<http://www.simaud.org> or contact:

I think its a typo.

water being approx 1000 kg/m3, mud phuska should be 1731 kg/m3. Which is
also in the range of 1500-1900 for soil.

The question below does not say what 'tutorial' was accessed. The usual place for
learning strategies for using ESP-r is the ESP-r Cookbook and that is in the publications
list and it also shows up in the software -> esp-r -> beginners guide link. Most of the
points in the process of planning, creating, checking and using models is covered. The
topic of how to understand performance predictions is not yet covered (but is on the
to-do list) ;-)

One of the better ways of getting up to speed is to attend a workshop - there is a
training page on the ESRU website that gives details as well as how to join in the
ESP-r community discussion list.

Hello All,
I am totally new to ESP-r and I was going through the tutorial that?s available on ESP-r website. I was wondering if any one of you has any other material I can go through to understand the start to finish of modeling in ESP-r that is easy to understand. For example: Step by Step process on how to construct a total model and how to read the results.

Hi Christopher,

 

Your task-at-hand isn't clear to me...  

 

1.       If you are being asked to prepare a report to explore the
potential for LEED points (and you're in the consulting role for the
building owner/architect/engineers/etc...), then you should let us know
what energy modeling software you're using.  If it's eQuest, I'd suggest
including within your report the colorful/informative  "Monthly Energy
Consumption by Enduse" and "Annual Utility Bills by Rate" graphical
reports, for both the baseline (90.1) and proposed models.  

2.       If you're being asked to generate the documents necessary for
submitting to LEED for EAc1 credits, you're advised to start by
downloading the current LEED template for EAc1, if you haven't already.
It does a pretty good job of outlining the kind of information that
needs to be submitted.

 

~Nick

Dear Nader,

Hello. I am delighted to see your mail. Regarding this MUD PHUSKA there
are certain physical properties that are described in the Indian
Standard. As per Hnadbook on Functional Requirements Of Buildings(Other
than Industrial Buildings),Bureau of Indian Standards-SP:41(S&T)-1987,
following are the properties of Mud Phuska,

Density = 1622 kg/cubic meter
Thermal Conductivity = 0.519 W/m.K
Spoecific Heat capacity = 0.88 kJ/kg.K

Kindly let me know if this helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Baseline system - VVT
Message-ID: <003001ca6233$d362eb90$7a28c2b0$@com>

Greetings everyone,

I was hoping someone could weigh in on this one:

I'm doing a PRM model for LEED EAc1. My proposed system is a packaged VVT
system for an office building. There are 3 individual offices and an open
office area, each of which has a VVT controller to modulate the airflow into
that zone, all air coming from the one packaged rooftop heat pump. Appendix
G indicates packaged single-zone heat pump as the baseline system.

My questions are:

1.       If 'thermal blocks' or zones need to be the same in baseline and
proposed cases, do I model the office as one zone or four zones? If one
zone, the nature of the VVT controls will not be accurately modeled. If four
zones, the baseline system will not be 'Single-zone', or it will assign 4
heat pumps (one per zone).

2.       I am using eQuest, and I just played around in the wizard with the
office modeled as a single zone. When I toggle from 'Packaged Single-Zone
Heat Pump' to 'Packaged VVT' in 'system type' box, the VVT shows higher
space cooling energy and lower fan energy than PSZHP. I thought it was going
to be the other way. I feel like I'm not understanding this correctly, so if
anyone could explain this result to me briefly, I would appreciate it.

Thanks in advance for any feedback.

 

Duke

Colleagues-- 

 

Does anyone know if the property "in service" date of January 1, 2008 is
extended or if an extension is under consideration?

 

Per the IRS Notice 2006-52,  Section 179D of EPAct 2005 "allows a
deduction to a taxpayer for all or part of the cost of energy efficient
building property that a taxpayer places in service after December 31,
2005, and before January 1, 2008."  

 

Many thanks!  Regards,

	energy simulation workshop in Washington DC
Message-ID: <012201ca623a$a1d29c40$e577d4c0$@com>

We are holding a 2-Day DesignBuilder/EnergyPlus  "advanced" building energy
simulation workshop in the campus of Catholic University of America in
Washington DC on Monday and Tuesday, 14 - 15 December 2009. The workshop is
being lead by Dr. Mahabir Bhandari of DesignBuilder Software (USA) and James
V. Dirkes II, P.E., LEED AP of The Building Performance Team. Both personnel
have extensive experience in the use and teaching of building energy
simulation programs. Participants will use the DesignBuilder/EnergyPlus
suite extensively over the two days. 

Day1 will be focused on developing building geometry with DesignBuilder,
importing from 2D-DXF and 3D gbXML import from CAD.  Various DB features,
including complex geometry, template  and Model Data Management, Schedules,
Heating Design, Cooling Design, Simulation options, parametric runs will be
discussed.

 Day2 will be focused on modelling systems using EnergyPlus.  A simple
5-zone model will be exported from DesignBuilder to EnergyPlus.  The native
IDF Editor will be used to modify and expand DesignBuilder's standard HVAC
system templates to better reflect the desired HVAC system.  A series of
HVAC design upgrades will be tested.  These could include, adding AHUs,
supply air reset control, VSD drives, low turn down ratios or upgrading air
cooled to water cooled plant.  The model will be modified to meet ASHRAE
90.1 Appendix G requirements

This workshop is a great opportunity for training staff in predicting the
energy/greenhouse performance of buildings.  These skills would be
invaluable in the current tough economic climate juxtaposed with increasing
concern about global warming.  Projects that do proceed, either new or
renovation, will have an increased focus on sustainable performance.  We
look forward to meeting with you at the workshop.

" I may be crazy enough to take on Batman, but the IRS? No thank you!"

                ~The Joker

 

My humble advice to anyone pursuing EPAcT tax deductions, to avoid potential for tax problems for yourself and/or your clients:  

1)      Acquire, become familiar with, and keep at-hand in a searchable format the following free and publicly available legislation/documents:

?         Section 179D of Tax Code

?         IRS Notice 2008-40

?         IRS Notice 2006-52

?         EPAct 2005

2)      More recommended reading, referenced from the above legislation:

?         NEMA - EPACT Tax Incentive Certification Letter Guidance

?         NREL - Energy Savings Modeling and Inspection Guidelines

3)      Any licensed professional signing off on EPAcT compliance certification documents should be aware that they are in effect tying themselves to the tax documents of another.  As with anything, read and know what you are signing!

Linda;
 
My understanding is that the date has been extended until January 1, 2014.  This is based on a FAQ on the website:

Colleagues-- 



Does anyone know if the property "in service" date of January 1, 2008 is
extended or if an extension is under consideration?



Per the IRS Notice 2006-52,  Section 179D of EPAct 2005 "allows a
deduction to a taxpayer for all or part of the cost of energy efficient
building property that a taxpayer places in service after December 31,
2005, and before January 1, 2008."  



Many thanks!  Regards,





Linda

energy simulation workshop in Washington DC
Message-ID: <012201ca623a$a1d29c40$e577d4c0$@com>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

We are holding a 2-Day DesignBuilder/EnergyPlus  "advanced" building energy
simulation workshop in the campus of Catholic University of America in
Washington DC on Monday and Tuesday, 14 - 15 December 2009. The workshop is
being lead by Dr. Mahabir Bhandari of DesignBuilder Software (USA) and James
V. Dirkes II, P.E., LEED AP of The Building Performance Team. Both personnel
have extensive experience in the use and teaching of building energy
simulation programs. Participants will use the DesignBuilder/EnergyPlus
suite extensively over the two days. 

Day1 will be focused on developing building geometry with DesignBuilder,
importing from 2D-DXF and 3D gbXML import from CAD.  Various DB features,
including complex geometry, template  and Model Data Management, Schedules,
Heating Design, Cooling Design, Simulation options, parametric runs will be
discussed.

Day2 will be focused on modelling systems using EnergyPlus.  A simple
5-zone model will be exported from DesignBuilder to EnergyPlus.  The native
IDF Editor will be used to modify and expand DesignBuilder's standard HVAC
system templates to better reflect the desired HVAC system.  A series of
HVAC design upgrades will be tested.  These could include, adding AHUs,
supply air reset control, VSD drives, low turn down ratios or upgrading air
cooled to water cooled plant.  The model will be modified to meet ASHRAE
90.1 Appendix G requirements

This workshop is a great opportunity for training staff in predicting the
energy/greenhouse performance of buildings.  These skills would be
invaluable in the current tough economic climate juxtaposed with increasing
concern about global warming.  Projects that do proceed, either new or
renovation, will have an increased focus on sustainable performance.  We
look forward to meeting with you at the workshop.

*About the workshop*

The four days workshop is an opportunity to learn how to perform energy
simulation of buildings for LEED and ECBC through hands-on training on
energy simulation tools and case studies. Besides sailing through the
process of building energy simulation up to report preparation stage, the
workshop would also cover fundamental concepts related to building physics
required to utilize these simulation tools. This course focuses on the
skills and knowledge required for carrying out energy simulations for LEED
and ECBC.

 Some common questions which will be answered through interactive exercises
are:

   - How much detailing is required for energy modeling
   - What are the impacts of lighting, internal loads, occupancy schedules
   on energy consumption
   - How to analyze simulation results and propose energy conservation
   measure (ECMs).
   - How to rank ECMs on life cycle cost basis

We would be more than happy to furnish any further detail/clarification in
this regard, if required.

best greetings,
jyotirmay

Hello,

For international locations A90.1 states:

5.1.4.2 International Locations. For locations in Canada that are listed in Table B-2
in Appendix B, use this table to determine the required climate zone number and, when
a climate zone letter is also required, use Table B-4 and the Major Climate Type
Definitions in Appendix B to determine the letter (A, B, or C). For locations in
other international countries that are listed in Table B-3, use this table to
determine the required climate zone number and, when a climate zone letter is also
required, use Table B-4 and the Major Climate Type Definitions in Appendix B to
determine the letter (A, B, or C). For all international locations that are not
listed either in Table B-2 or B-3, use Table B-4 and the Major Climate Type
Definitions in Appendix B to determine both the climate zone letter and number.

With the emphasis on the statement "when a climate zone letter is also required,
...", does anybody know what triggers the requirement for a climate zone letter? I've
found one international location to yield different zones via table B-3 and B-4. What
do I do in this situation?

Best regards

Chris

Dear Sir,
                I have some doubts in ASHRAE90.1 statements as follows


Page 178  G.3.1.3.11

1 Heat rejection: "Condenser water design supply temperature shall be
85F or 10F approach at design wet bulb temperature,whichever is lower,
with a design temperature rise of 10F". I could not understand meaning
of this statement can anyone through light on this statement.

2: G 3.1.3.10

Chilled water pumps: "Chilled water pumps in system less than
120000ft2 shall be modeled as a primary/secondary systems with
secondary pump riding the pump cure" Can anyone explain the meaning of
this statement.

Thanks

the calculation for different spaces based on occupancy and floor area
of the occupied space.
If we consider an unoccupied office space at night (i.e. not strictly a
"zone  anymore" ); is there any requirement to provide minimum fresh air
wihin the office space. 


Thanks in advance for your help
Michael

Sambhav,

You must be new in this area.  Let me give it a try.

1.  This is about the cooling tower.  The design wet bulb temperature is 
the wet bulb (saturated) air temperature at the deign condition.  This wet 
bulb temperature adds 10F (approach) is the assumed water temperature 
leaving the tower to enter the condenser.  This assumed temperature 
compares with 85F, whichever is lower is the one that is going to be used 
for the condenser water supply  temperature by this design.  Is this a 
little clearer?   :-)

2.  This is about Primary-Seconary pump system.  Let me draw the diagram 
to make it easier to understand.
 
 
 
As shown in the above system diagram, using the Secondary pump loop as the 
pump cure for your system calculation.


Hope that helps a little.  :-)

Dear Sir,
                I have some doubts in ASHRAE90.1 statements as follows


Page 178  G.3.1.3.11

1 Heat rejection: "Condenser water design supply temperature shall be
85F or 10F approach at design wet bulb temperature,whichever is lower,
with a design temperature rise of 10F". I could not understand meaning
of this statement can anyone through light on this statement.

2: G 3.1.3.10

Chilled water pumps: "Chilled water pumps in system less than
120000ft2 shall be modeled as a primary/secondary systems with
secondary pump riding the pump cure" Can anyone explain the meaning of
this statement.

Thanks
Sambhav Tiwari

Subject: [Bldg-sim] GBCI approval of carbon monoxide control of garage fans?
Message-ID: <25F2BDB6656B8F40A1289ED906D6B5CF06D4A426@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

Does anyone know if the GBCI reviewers are currently accepting ECMs
based off of garage carbon monoxide sensors to index garage fans?  Or if
this can actually be included in the model with appropriate explanation?

 

IMC requires constant ventilation for enclosed garages, but allows
CO-based systems to activate the fans.  This equates to a substantial
energy savings since most systems like this only operate a few hours in
the morning, evening, and at lunch (other than the minimum 0.05 cfm / sq
ft continuous ventilation required by the IMC).

 

If we explain the system, and explain our assumptions for the use
schedules that dictate the proposed building fan schedules for the
garage, is this acceptable?

 

Do they require any backup support/studies for exactly how often the CO
levels will rise above acceptable limits, or is it sufficient to make a
conservative assumption that the garage fans will operate from 7-9am,
11-1pm, and 4-6pm at full load?  In my engineering experience, CO-based
systems rarely run, and the circulation fans throughout the garage
(which approximate the continuous 0.05 cfm / sq ft requirements of the
IMC CO-based systems) are what really prevent isolated CO buildup.

 

Thanks in advance,

No.

 

Refer to Section 5.4: 

"Mechanical ventilation systems shall include controls, manual or
automatic, that enable the fan system to operate whenever the spaces
served are occupied.  The system shall be designed to maintain the
minimum outdoor airflow as required by Section 6 under any load
condition."  

 

In summary, you must provided the minimum ventilation rate as prescribed
in Chapter 6 only when (A) the space is occupied and (B) there's a
thermal load condition (or manual control - see Section 5.4) triggering
the operation of the ventilation system.

 

Your original question is confusing to at least a few of us because of
stating an office ceases to be a "zone" at night...  It's a terminology
thing, but 62.1 and other standards will become more digestible to you
when you recognize that's not the case.  The clarification we're making
here is that where a zone occupancy (i.e. "office") is decided and a
constant over time, something like "occupancy rate" can be variable.

 

I'd like to also point out, based on your first inquiry, that the
equation at 6.2.2.1 uses maximum zone occupancy to establish the minimum
design OA rate, not the hourly occupancy rate (which may be zero).

I know this is a contentious issue on bldg-sim regarding whether this
should be a allowable measure or not. 

 

I can tell you that on a recent office building project (LEED-NC v2.2) we
submitted for energy savings from garage CO sensors. The only comment we
got from the reviewer was that "ASHRAE mandates some sort of timed control
or CO control as part of the mandatory measures," so we couldn't compare
against a 24/7 constant volume system. I wish they had quoted a specific
section of 90.1 for clarity. 

 

We switched the baseline system to be off for ~6 hours during the night
(not in agreement with the IMC requirement for continuous air movement),
and they accepted our energy savings.

 

Our proposed case simply had the fans on a VFD and we created a custom
schedule, which we presented to the reviewer, to reflect that the fans
typically were at their lowest setting, and only ramped up for peak
commuting hours (small peaks for morning and lunch, big peak at end of the
day when all the cold engines start up and really put out the CO). 

 

It is unclear to me if you are modeling a residential garage, where there
may genuinely be 24/7 use, if you get to compare to a 24/7 constant volume
system.

Since we are on this topic, I had a question on definition of occupancy.

I havn't read the standard in detail, but isn't there a requirement of
some OA/sqft in addition to OA/person. 

Let's assume that an office is assumed normally occupied from 8 am to 6
pm -  Then during unoccupied hours (6.01 pm to 7.59 am) can the OA be
zero or should it be OA per sqft?

More tricky, let's say we have a occupancy sensor and know that the
office is unoccupied from 12.00 pm to 3 pm (during the regular office
times). What is the OA at this time - 0 or OA/sqft?

Thanks

No.

 

Refer to Section 5.4: 

"Mechanical ventilation systems shall include controls, manual or
automatic, that enable the fan system to operate whenever the spaces
served are occupied.  The system shall be designed to maintain the
minimum outdoor airflow as required by Section 6 under any load
condition."  

 

In summary, you must provided the minimum ventilation rate as prescribed
in Chapter 6 only when (A) the space is occupied and (B) there's a
thermal load condition (or manual control - see Section 5.4) triggering
the operation of the ventilation system.

 

Your original question is confusing to at least a few of us because of
stating an office ceases to be a "zone" at night...  It's a terminology
thing, but 62.1 and other standards will become more digestible to you
when you recognize that's not the case.  The clarification we're making
here is that where a zone occupancy (i.e. "office") is decided and a
constant over time, something like "occupancy rate" can be variable.

 

I'd like to also point out, based on your first inquiry, that the
equation at 6.2.2.1 uses maximum zone occupancy to establish the minimum
design OA rate, not the hourly occupancy rate (which may be zero).

You are correct.  Refer to the equation of Section 6.2.2.1 as I
referenced below.

 

Let's assume that an office is assumed normally occupied from 8 am to 6
pm -  Then during unoccupied hours (6.01 pm to 7.59 am) can the OA be
zero or should it be OA per sqft?

 

It sounds like you're asking the same question I just answered, so I may
not be understanding completely...  By Section 5.4 I do not believe an
unoccupied space is required to have any OA supplied.  The equation in
6.2.2.1 does include a component "per square foot," but that equation is
for determining the design minimum OA rate.

 

More tricky, let's say we have a occupancy sensor and know that the
office is unoccupied from 12.00 pm to 3 pm (during the regular office
times). What is the OA at this time - 0 or OA/sqft?

 

Applying the same logic and the same section, 5.4, if there are controls
that automatically determine a space is occupied and turn the associated
system on to provide the required OA, then there's no reason those
systems aren't allowed to turn off while unoccupied.  Short answer for
your example:  0.

 

I'll point out, I'm merely an E.I.T. (with my head in the books) sharing
my interpretations, so it may be worth holding out for a second opinion
=).

Thanks Nick. The reason I had the question was because I think OA/sqft
technically should not be dependent on occupancy. If that was the case,
it would suffice to just increase the OA/sqft and have only one number
to take care of. What I am not sure of is whether OA/sqft is used only
during the typical occupied hours irrespective of whether it is actually
occupied or not or is it used throughtout the day/weekend/vacation etc.
What do the hvac designers specify for the control of OA?

Ok, so here's a question - what happens when you have a space that is almost
NEVER occupied, but has a cfm/sf requirement - like a storage room with a
requirement of 0.12 cfm/sf.  This is a pretty high outdoor airflow,
especially if you're just storing old files.

So do you need this ventilation rate only when the building is occupied,
only when the space is occupied, or all the time?

If you only need the ventilation when the space is occupied, and it is
almost never occupied, why install the ventilation in the first place?

Karen,

 

In this case your storage room, while listed in table 6-1, isn't
classified as "occupiable space". The definition of occupiable spaces
specifically excludes those spaced that are "only occupied occasionally
and for short periods of time". Only regularly occupied areas (occupied
spaces) require ventilation air. Your storage space is not regularly
occupied and therefore requires no ventilation air.

What do the hvac designers specify for the control of OA?

I havn't read the standard in detail, but isn't there a requirement of
some OA/sqft in addition to OA/person. 

 

You are correct.  Refer to the equation of Section 6.2.2.1 as I
referenced below.

 

Let's assume that an office is assumed normally occupied from 8 am to 6
pm -  Then during unoccupied hours (6.01 pm to 7.59 am) can the OA be
zero or should it be OA per sqft?

 

It sounds like you're asking the same question I just answered, so I may
not be understanding completely...  By Section 5.4 I do not believe an
unoccupied space is required to have any OA supplied.  The equation in
6.2.2.1 does include a component "per square foot," but that equation is
for determining the design minimum OA rate.

 

More tricky, let's say we have a occupancy sensor and know that the
office is unoccupied from 12.00 pm to 3 pm (during the regular office
times). What is the OA at this time - 0 or OA/sqft?

 

Applying the same logic and the same section, 5.4, if there are controls
that automatically determine a space is occupied and turn the associated
system on to provide the required OA, then there's no reason those
systems aren't allowed to turn off while unoccupied.  Short answer for
your example:  0.

 

I'll point out, I'm merely an E.I.T. (with my head in the books) sharing
my interpretations, so it may be worth holding out for a second opinion
=).

Since we are on this topic, I had a question on definition of occupancy.

I havn't read the standard in detail, but isn't there a requirement of
some OA/sqft in addition to OA/person.

No.

 

Refer to Section 5.4: 

"Mechanical ventilation systems shall include controls, manual or
automatic, that enable the fan system to operate whenever the spaces
served are occupied.  The system shall be designed to maintain the
minimum outdoor airflow as required by Section 6 under any load
condition."  

 

In summary, you must provided the minimum ventilation rate as prescribed
in Chapter 6 only when (A) the space is occupied and (B) there's a
thermal load condition (or manual control - see Section 5.4) triggering
the operation of the ventilation system.

 

Your original question is confusing to at least a few of us because of
stating an office ceases to be a "zone" at night...  It's a terminology
thing, but 62.1 and other standards will become more digestible to you
when you recognize that's not the case.  The clarification we're making
here is that where a zone occupancy (i.e. "office") is decided and a
constant over time, something like "occupancy rate" can be variable.

 

I'd like to also point out, based on your first inquiry, that the
equation at 6.2.2.1 uses maximum zone occupancy to establish the minimum
design OA rate, not the hourly occupancy rate (which may be zero).

Michael, 

Technically answering your question may not help you much.  You need to
make the question clearer and more meaningful.  Tell people what you are
trying to do, what is in your mind, and what you are trying to
accomplish.  Then this group may help you more on the target. 

Thanks.

Dear all, 

ASHARE 62.1 2007 deifned zone as an occupied space. Table 6-1 provides
the calculation for different spaces based on occupancy and floor area
of the occupied space. 

If we consider an unoccupied office space at night (i.e. not strictly a
"zone  anymore" ); is there any requirement to provide minimum fresh air
wihin the office space. 

Thanks in advance for your help 
Michael

I may be wrong, but it appears a number of people aren't examining the
equation in 6.2.2.1 as I'm suggesting.  If you'll check that out I'm
certain you'll find this is a much simpler question/answer than it's
being made out to be.

 

Both sets of figures provided in Table 6-1 (OA/person and OA/SF) are
used to determine the design minimum OA rate, using 6.2.2.1's equation.
Occupancy has no effect on the OA/SF requirement, and likewise zonal
area has no effect on the OA/person requirement.  Additionally, the
occupancy figure used is the maximum occupancy of that zone.  Quoting
6.2.2.1:  "Pz = zone population: the largest number of people expected
to occupy the zone during typical usage..."  It is not the hourly
percentage occupancy and is not zero unless the space is never normally
occupied (as with a storage room like Karen suggested).

 

The design minimum OA rate is only applicable when the ventilation
system is operating.  Unless I'm missing something major, the
ventilation system is not required by ASHRAE 62.1 to operate 24 hours
per day  (again, refer to Section 5.4, which I've copied entirely
below).

 

 

I'll try to break down the current questions/statements on the table:

 

The reason I had the question was because I think OA/sqft technically
should not be dependent on occupancy...

That's a fair judgement a designer is allowed to make.  The 62.1
Standard is just that - not a code, but a set of suggestions provided by
some of those best qualified to provide them.  To play the devil's
advocate, the counter-argument is that Occupancy cannot be ignored by an
energy-conscious ventilation system designer.

 

...If that was the case, it would suffice to just increase the OA/sqft
and have only one number to take care of.

Someone doing that would be ignoring the equation Table 6-1 was built
around (re: 6.2.2.1).  I'd agree that would be a misinterpretation of
the standard.

 

What I am not sure of is whether OA/sqft is used only during the typical
occupied hours irrespective of whether it is actually occupied or not or
is it used throughtout the day/weekend/vacation etc.

OA/SF is always used alongside OA/person to determine the "breathing
zone outdoor airflow." (Which I've been calling the design minimum OA
rate).  The question of when these ventilation rates apply is tied to
when the zone is occupied.  To restate my position (Again Ref: Section
5.4):  ASHRAE 62.1 does not require that ventilation systems operate
during unoccupied times.

 

What do the hvac designers specify for the control of OA?

Not sure whether a concise answer can be provided to this broad
question... OA ventilation can be controlled by any combination of
scheduling/occupancy sensing/timer control/temperature/humidity/VOC,
CO2, CO or other air quality sensors... all depending on the project
budget, climate, and type of system being designed.  If this question
had a simple answer, then we wouldn't need HVAC designers =).

 

what happens when you have a space that is almost NEVER occupied, but
has a cfm/sf requirement - like a storage room with a requirement of
0.12 cfm/sf. 

See my answer above.

 

So do you need this ventilation rate only when the building is occupied,
only when the space is occupied, or all the time?

Strictly speaking, only when the zone (space) is occupied.  If you have
a one-zone system that doesn't distinguish between occupancy rates, then
whenever the building is occupied.

 

If you only need the ventilation when the space is occupied, and it is
almost never occupied, why install the ventilation in the first place?

This is a broad-scope question, so I'll add another quote under Section
1, entitled "PURPOSE:"

"1.1        The purpose of this standard is to specify minimum
ventilation rates and other measures intended to provide indoor air
quality that is acceptable to human occupants ant that minimizes adverse
health effects."

If a space is never occupied, then ASHRAE doesn't care about air
quality.  If a space is "almost never occupied," then they do.  To
continue your example, if you have a storage warehouse with no
ventilation installed, and it's almost never occupied, someone might
eventually store something in that space that without ventilation would
eventually cause a health hazard to the next occupant entering the
space.  In my college years, this was a commonly observed effect caused
on a small scale by my roommates forgetting food in the microwave =).

Ok, so here's a question - what happens when you have a space that is
almost NEVER occupied, but has a cfm/sf requirement - like a storage
room with a requirement of 0.12 cfm/sf.  This is a pretty high outdoor
airflow, especially if you're just storing old files.

So do you need this ventilation rate only when the building is occupied,
only when the space is occupied, or all the time?

If you only need the ventilation when the space is occupied, and it is
almost never occupied, why install the ventilation in the first place?

I havn't read the standard in detail, but isn't there a requirement of
some OA/sqft in addition to OA/person. 

 

You are correct.  Refer to the equation of Section 6.2.2.1 as I
referenced below.

 

Let's assume that an office is assumed normally occupied from 8 am to 6
pm -  Then during unoccupied hours (6.01 pm to 7.59 am) can the OA be
zero or should it be OA per sqft?

 

It sounds like you're asking the same question I just answered, so I may
not be understanding completely...  By Section 5.4 I do not believe an
unoccupied space is required to have any OA supplied.  The equation in
6.2.2.1 does include a component "per square foot," but that equation is
for determining the design minimum OA rate.

 

More tricky, let's say we have a occupancy sensor and know that the
office is unoccupied from 12.00 pm to 3 pm (during the regular office
times). What is the OA at this time - 0 or OA/sqft?

 

Applying the same logic and the same section, 5.4, if there are controls
that automatically determine a space is occupied and turn the associated
system on to provide the required OA, then there's no reason those
systems aren't allowed to turn off while unoccupied.  Short answer for
your example:  0.

 

I'll point out, I'm merely an E.I.T. (with my head in the books) sharing
my interpretations, so it may be worth holding out for a second opinion
=).

Since we are on this topic, I had a question on definition of occupancy.

I havn't read the standard in detail, but isn't there a requirement of
some OA/sqft in addition to OA/person.

No.

 

Refer to Section 5.4: 

"Mechanical ventilation systems shall include controls, manual or
automatic, that enable the fan system to operate whenever the spaces
served are occupied.  The system shall be designed to maintain the
minimum outdoor airflow as required by Section 6 under any load
condition."  

 

In summary, you must provided the minimum ventilation rate as prescribed
in Chapter 6 only when (A) the space is occupied and (B) there's a
thermal load condition (or manual control - see Section 5.4) triggering
the operation of the ventilation system.

 

Your original question is confusing to at least a few of us because of
stating an office ceases to be a "zone" at night...  It's a terminology
thing, but 62.1 and other standards will become more digestible to you
when you recognize that's not the case.  The clarification we're making
here is that where a zone occupancy (i.e. "office") is decided and a
constant over time, something like "occupancy rate" can be variable.

 

I'd like to also point out, based on your first inquiry, that the
equation at 6.2.2.1 uses maximum zone occupancy to establish the minimum
design OA rate, not the hourly occupancy rate (which may be zero).

is there any requirement to provide minimum outdoor fresh air wihin the
office space when it is unoccupied according to ASHRAE 62.1

 

Do you think it it clear enough?

Michael, 

Technically answering your question may not help you much.  You need to
make the question clearer and more meaningful.  Tell people what you are
trying to do, what is in your mind, and what you are trying to
accomplish.  Then this group may help you more on the target. 

Thanks.

Dear all, 

ASHARE 62.1 2007 deifned zone as an occupied space. Table 6-1 provides
the calculation for different spaces based on occupancy and floor area
of the occupied space. 

If we consider an unoccupied office space at night (i.e. not strictly a
"zone  anymore" ); is there any requirement to provide minimum fresh air
wihin the office space. 

Thanks in advance for your help 
Michael

Ok, this makes more sense.  What about corridors that have only transient
and very low occupancy rates?  Can this also be classified as unoccupied?

Note that Table 6-1 has "-" under the CFM/person values for ("General")
corridors, storage spaces, electrical rooms and similar spaces.  I
consider this ASHRAE's indirect guidance on spaces you can consider
"typically unoccupied" (Pz = 0) for the purposes of determining the
minimum OA rate.

Ok, this makes more sense.  What about corridors that have only
transient and very low occupancy rates?  Can this also be classified as
unoccupied?

I may be wrong, but it appears a number of people aren't examining the
equation in 6.2.2.1 as I'm suggesting.  If you'll check that out I'm
certain you'll find this is a much simpler question/answer than it's
being made out to be.

 

Both sets of figures provided in Table 6-1 (OA/person and OA/SF) are
used to determine the design minimum OA rate, using 6.2.2.1's equation.
Occupancy has no effect on the OA/SF requirement, and likewise zonal
area has no effect on the OA/person requirement.  Additionally, the
occupancy figure used is the maximum occupancy of that zone.  Quoting  
6.2.2.1:  "Pz = zone population: the largest number of people expected
to occupy the zone during typical usage..."  It is not the hourly
percentage occupancy and is not zero unless the space is never normally
occupied (as with a storage room like Karen suggested).

 

The design minimum OA rate is only applicable when the ventilation
system is operating.  Unless I'm missing something major, the
ventilation system is not required by ASHRAE 62.1 to operate 24 hours
per day  (again, refer to Section 5.4, which I've copied entirely
below).

 

 

I'll try to break down the current questions/statements on the table:

 

The reason I had the question was because I think OA/sqft technically
should not be dependent on occupancy...

That's a fair judgement a designer is allowed to make.  The 62.1
Standard is just that - not a code, but a set of suggestions provided by
some of those best qualified to provide them.  To play the devil's
advocate, the counter-argument is that Occupancy cannot be ignored by an
energy-conscious ventilation system designer.

 

...If that was the case, it would suffice to just increase the OA/sqft
and have only one number to take care of.

Someone doing that would be ignoring the equation Table 6-1 was built
around (re: 6.2.2.1).  I'd agree that would be a misinterpretation of
the standard.

 

What I am not sure of is whether OA/sqft is used only during the typical
occupied hours irrespective of whether it is actually occupied or not or
is it used throughtout the day/weekend/vacation etc.

OA/SF is always used alongside OA/person to determine the "breathing
zone outdoor airflow." (Which I've been calling the design minimum OA
rate).  The question of when these ventilation rates apply is tied to
when the zone is occupied.  To restate my position (Again Ref: Section
5.4):  ASHRAE 62.1 does not require that ventilation systems operate
during unoccupied times.

 

What do the hvac designers specify for the control of OA?

Not sure whether a concise answer can be provided to this broad
question... OA ventilation can be controlled by any combination of
scheduling/occupancy sensing/timer control/temperature/humidity/VOC,
CO2, CO or other air quality sensors... all depending on the project
budget, climate, and type of system being designed.  If this question
had a simple answer, then we wouldn't need HVAC designers =).

 

what happens when you have a space that is almost NEVER occupied, but
has a cfm/sf requirement - like a storage room with a requirement of
0.12 cfm/sf. 

See my answer above.

 

So do you need this ventilation rate only when the building is occupied,
only when the space is occupied, or all the time?

Strictly speaking, only when the zone (space) is occupied.  If you have
a one-zone system that doesn't distinguish between occupancy rates, then
whenever the building is occupied.

 

If you only need the ventilation when the space is occupied, and it is
almost never occupied, why install the ventilation in the first place?

This is a broad-scope question, so I'll add another quote under Section
1, entitled "PURPOSE:"

"1.1        The purpose of this standard is to specify minimum
ventilation rates and other measures intended to provide indoor air
quality that is acceptable to human occupants ant that minimizes adverse
health effects."

If a space is never occupied, then ASHRAE doesn't care about air
quality.  If a space is "almost never occupied," then they do.  To
continue your example, if you have a storage warehouse with no
ventilation installed, and it's almost never occupied, someone might
eventually store something in that space that without ventilation would
eventually cause a health hazard to the next occupant entering the
space.  In my college years, this was a commonly observed effect caused
on a small scale by my roommates forgetting food in the microwave =).

Ok, so here's a question - what happens when you have a space that is
almost NEVER occupied, but has a cfm/sf requirement - like a storage
room with a requirement of 0.12 cfm/sf.  This is a pretty high outdoor
airflow, especially if you're just storing old files.

So do you need this ventilation rate only when the building is occupied,
only when the space is occupied, or all the time?

If you only need the ventilation when the space is occupied, and it is
almost never occupied, why install the ventilation in the first place?

I havn't read the standard in detail, but isn't there a requirement of
some OA/sqft in addition to OA/person. 

 

You are correct.  Refer to the equation of Section 6.2.2.1 as I
referenced below.

 

Let's assume that an office is assumed normally occupied from 8 am to 6
pm -  Then during unoccupied hours (6.01 pm to 7.59 am) can the OA be
zero or should it be OA per sqft?

 

It sounds like you're asking the same question I just answered, so I may
not be understanding completely...  By Section 5.4 I do not believe an
unoccupied space is required to have any OA supplied.  The equation in
6.2.2.1 does include a component "per square foot," but that equation is
for determining the design minimum OA rate.

 

More tricky, let's say we have a occupancy sensor and know that the
office is unoccupied from 12.00 pm to 3 pm (during the regular office
times). What is the OA at this time - 0 or OA/sqft?

 

Applying the same logic and the same section, 5.4, if there are controls
that automatically determine a space is occupied and turn the associated
system on to provide the required OA, then there's no reason those
systems aren't allowed to turn off while unoccupied.  Short answer for
your example:  0.

 

I'll point out, I'm merely an E.I.T. (with my head in the books) sharing
my interpretations, so it may be worth holding out for a second opinion
=).

Since we are on this topic, I had a question on definition of occupancy.

I havn't read the standard in detail, but isn't there a requirement of
some OA/sqft in addition to OA/person. 

Let's assume that an office is assumed normally occupied from 8 am to 6
pm -  Then during unoccupied hours (6.01 pm to 7.59 am) can the OA be

No.

 

Refer to Section 5.4: 

"Mechanical ventilation systems shall include controls, manual or
automatic, that enable the fan system to operate whenever the spaces
served are occupied.  The system shall be designed to maintain the
minimum outdoor airflow as required by Section 6 under any load
condition."  

 

In summary, you must provided the minimum ventilation rate as prescribed
in Chapter 6 only when (A) the space is occupied and (B) there's a
thermal load condition (or manual control - see Section 5.4) triggering
the operation of the ventilation system.

 

Your original question is confusing to at least a few of us because of
stating an office ceases to be a "zone" at night...  It's a terminology
thing, but 62.1 and other standards will become more digestible to you
when you recognize that's not the case.  The clarification we're making
here is that where a zone occupancy (i.e. "office") is decided and a
constant over time, something like "occupancy rate" can be variable.

 

I'd like to also point out, based on your first inquiry, that the
equation at 6.2.2.1 uses maximum zone occupancy to establish the minimum
design OA rate, not the hourly occupancy rate (which may be zero).

Michael, 

Technically answering your question may not help you much.  You need to
make the question clearer and more meaningful.  Tell people what you are
trying to do, what is in your mind, and what you are trying to
accomplish.  Then this group may help you more on the target.

Dear all, 

ASHARE 62.1 2007 deifned zone as an occupied space. Table 6-1 provides
the calculation for different spaces based on occupancy and floor area
of the occupied space. 

If we consider an unoccupied office space at night (i.e. not strictly a
"zone  anymore" ); is there any requirement to provide minimum fresh air
wihin the office space. 

Thanks in advance for your help 
Michael

Hi Karen
I had similar questions as you do. However, typically the HVAC design at unoccupied hours is to enable the air handling unit, heat or cool and recirculate the air to maintain the night setback temperature setting .
As the Storage rooms, ventilation will be provided during the occupied hours . I think the reason to provide ventilation for storage room is to avoid stale air or dust accumulation. Probably the storage rooms will have occupancy occasionally during regular work hour.

Ok, so here's a question - what happens when you have a space that is almost NEVER occupied, but has a cfm/sf requirement - like a storage room with a requirement of 0.12 cfm/sf.  This is a pretty high outdoor airflow, especially if you're just storing old files.

So do you need this ventilation rate only when the building is occupied, only when the space is occupied, or all the time?

If you only need the ventilation when the space is occupied, and it is almost never occupied, why install the ventilation in the first place?

No.

Refer to Section 5.4:
"Mechanical ventilation systems shall include controls, manual or automatic, that enable the fan system to operate whenever the spaces served are occupied.  The system shall be designed to maintain the minimum outdoor airflow as required by Section 6 under any load condition."

In summary, you must provided the minimum ventilation rate as prescribed in Chapter 6 only when (A) the space is occupied and (B) there's a thermal load condition (or manual control - see Section 5.4) triggering the operation of the ventilation system.

Your original question is confusing to at least a few of us because of stating an office ceases to be a "zone" at night...  It's a terminology thing, but 62.1 and other standards will become more digestible to you when you recognize that's not the case.  The clarification we're making here is that where a zone occupancy (i.e. "office") is decided and a constant over time, something like "occupancy rate" can be variable.

I'd like to also point out, based on your first inquiry, that the equation at 6.2.2.1 uses maximum zone occupancy to establish the minimum design OA rate, not the hourly occupancy rate (which may be zero).

Dear all,

ASHARE 62.1 2007 deifned zone as an occupied space. Table 6-1 provides the calculation for different spaces based on occupancy and floor area of the occupied space.

If we consider an unoccupied office space at night (i.e. not strictly a "zone  anymore" ); is there any requirement to provide minimum fresh air wihin the office space.

Thanks in advance for your help

Nick,

 

I agree that both a per-person and per-area rate must be calculated to
determine the total OA.  I have two comments though:

 

1.    In many jurisdictions, ASHRAE 62.1 is not suggested practice,
rather a code that must be met.  For example, all buildings built in
Ontario must be designed in accordance with 62.1.

 

2.    I don't think you could ever effectively argue that there are any
unoccupied spaces in a building, other than say mechanical shafts (I
clearly just contradicted myself...).  Although a storage room is not
regularly occupied, somebody will eventually have to store something in
it and at some point retrieve it.  

 

Regardless though, Pz in equation 6.2.2.1 applies only to the per-person
rate, which in the case of storage rooms and corridors is zero anyway,
so the zone outdoor airflow Vbz reduces to just the per-area rate x
area. Therefore, I think the per-area rate must always be supplied to
all spaces in the building during regularly occupied hours.  At night,
the ventilation system in the office building can be turned off, but
during normal office hours it should supply the total OA, which includes
OA for non-regularly occupied areas.  For multi-zone systems the total
OA is usually lower than the sum of all Vbz, to account for occupant
diversity and other system parameters. 

 

I think in reality, not all spaces are directly provided with ducted
ventilation air, and transfer air is often introduced via grilles in the
doorway.  Granted, one could question the effectiveness of that delivery
given the lack of exhaust fans to induce the air into the room as would
be the case in washrooms. Nonetheless, I've seen it done before.  

 

Cheers,

Note that Table 6-1 has "-" under the CFM/person values for ("General")
corridors, storage spaces, electrical rooms and similar spaces.  I
consider this ASHRAE's indirect guidance on spaces you can consider
"typically unoccupied" (Pz = 0) for the purposes of determining the
minimum OA rate.

I may be wrong, but it appears a number of people aren't examining the
equation in 6.2.2.1 as I'm suggesting.  If you'll check that out I'm
certain you'll find this is a much simpler question/answer than it's
being made out to be.

 

Both sets of figures provided in Table 6-1 (OA/person and OA/SF) are
used to determine the design minimum OA rate, using 6.2.2.1's equation.
Occupancy has no effect on the OA/SF requirement, and likewise zonal
area has no effect on the OA/person requirement.  Additionally, the
occupancy figure used is the maximum occupancy of that zone.  Quoting  
6.2.2.1:  "Pz = zone population: the largest number of people expected
to occupy the zone during typical usage..."  It is not the hourly
percentage occupancy and is not zero unless the space is never normally
occupied (as with a storage room like Karen suggested).

 

The design minimum OA rate is only applicable when the ventilation
system is operating.  Unless I'm missing something major, the
ventilation system is not required by ASHRAE 62.1 to operate 24 hours
per day  (again, refer to Section 5.4, which I've copied entirely
below).

 

 

I'll try to break down the current questions/statements on the table:

 

The reason I had the question was because I think OA/sqft technically
should not be dependent on occupancy...

That's a fair judgement a designer is allowed to make.  The 62.1
Standard is just that - not a code, but a set of suggestions provided by
some of those best qualified to provide them.  To play the devil's
advocate, the counter-argument is that Occupancy cannot be ignored by an
energy-conscious ventilation system designer.

 

...If that was the case, it would suffice to just increase the OA/sqft
and have only one number to take care of.

Someone doing that would be ignoring the equation Table 6-1 was built
around (re: 6.2.2.1).  I'd agree that would be a misinterpretation of
the standard.

 

What I am not sure of is whether OA/sqft is used only during the typical
occupied hours irrespective of whether it is actually occupied or not or
is it used throughtout the day/weekend/vacation etc.

OA/SF is always used alongside OA/person to determine the "breathing
zone outdoor airflow." (Which I've been calling the design minimum OA
rate).  The question of when these ventilation rates apply is tied to
when the zone is occupied.  To restate my position (Again Ref: Section
5.4):  ASHRAE 62.1 does not require that ventilation systems operate
during unoccupied times.

 

What do the hvac designers specify for the control of OA?

Not sure whether a concise answer can be provided to this broad
question... OA ventilation can be controlled by any combination of
scheduling/occupancy sensing/timer control/temperature/humidity/VOC,
CO2, CO or other air quality sensors... all depending on the project
budget, climate, and type of system being designed.  If this question
had a simple answer, then we wouldn't need HVAC designers =).

 

what happens when you have a space that is almost NEVER occupied, but
has a cfm/sf requirement - like a storage room with a requirement of
0.12 cfm/sf. 

See my answer above.

 

So do you need this ventilation rate only when the building is occupied,
only when the space is occupied, or all the time?

Strictly speaking, only when the zone (space) is occupied.  If you have
a one-zone system that doesn't distinguish between occupancy rates, then
whenever the building is occupied.

 

If you only need the ventilation when the space is occupied, and it is
almost never occupied, why install the ventilation in the first place?

This is a broad-scope question, so I'll add another quote under Section
1, entitled "PURPOSE:"

"1.1        The purpose of this standard is to specify minimum
ventilation rates and other measures intended to provide indoor air
quality that is acceptable to human occupants ant that minimizes adverse
health effects."

If a space is never occupied, then ASHRAE doesn't care about air
quality.  If a space is "almost never occupied," then they do.  To
continue your example, if you have a storage warehouse with no
ventilation installed, and it's almost never occupied, someone might
eventually store something in that space that without ventilation would
eventually cause a health hazard to the next occupant entering the
space.  In my college years, this was a commonly observed effect caused
on a small scale by my roommates forgetting food in the microwave =).

Since we are on this topic, I had a question on definition of occupancy.

I havn't read the standard in detail, but isn't there a requirement of
some OA/sqft in addition to OA/person. 

Let's assume that an office is assumed normally occupied from 8 am to 6
pm -  Then during unoccupied hours (6.01 pm to 7.59 am) can the OA be
zero or should it be OA per sqft?

More tricky, let's say we have a occupancy sensor and know that the
office is unoccupied from 12.00 pm to 3 pm (during the regular office
times). What is the OA at this time - 0 or OA/sqft?

Thanks

No.

 

Refer to Section 5.4: 

"Mechanical ventilation systems shall include controls, manual or
automatic, that enable the fan system to operate whenever the spaces
served are occupied.  The system shall be designed to maintain the
minimum outdoor airflow as required by Section 6 under any load
condition."  

 

In summary, you must provided the minimum ventilation rate as prescribed
in Chapter 6 only when (A) the space is occupied and (B) there's a
thermal load condition (or manual control - see Section 5.4) triggering
the operation of the ventilation system.

 

Your original question is confusing to at least a few of us because of
stating an office ceases to be a "zone" at night...  It's a terminology
thing, but 62.1 and other standards will become more digestible to you
when you recognize that's not the case.  The clarification we're making
here is that where a zone occupancy (i.e. "office") is decided and a
constant over time, something like "occupancy rate" can be variable.

 

I'd like to also point out, based on your first inquiry, that the
equation at 6.2.2.1 uses maximum zone occupancy to establish the minimum
design OA rate, not the hourly occupancy rate (which may be zero).

is there any requirement to provide minimum outdoor fresh air wihin the
office space when it is unoccupied according to ASHRAE 62.1

 

Do you think it it clear enough? 

Regards

Michael

Michael, 

Technically answering your question may not help you much.  You need to
make the question clearer and more meaningful.  Tell people what you are
trying to do, what is in your mind, and what you are trying to
accomplish.  Then this group may help you more on the target. 

Thanks.

[Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 62.1 unoccupied space minimum outdoor air supply 

 

		

 

Dear all, 

ASHARE 62.1 2007 deifned zone as an occupied space. Table 6-1 provides
the calculation for different spaces based on occupancy and floor area
of the occupied space. 

If we consider an unoccupied office space at night (i.e. not strictly a
"zone  anymore" ); is there any requirement to provide minimum fresh air
wihin the office space. 

Thanks in advance for your help 
Michael

In the equation in section 6.2.2.1, "Az" is defined as "zone floor area: the
net occupiable floor area of the zone"

and "occupiable space: an enclosed space intended for human activities,
excluding those spaces intended primarily for other purposes, such as
storage rooms and equipment rooms, that are only occupied occasionally and
for short periods of time."

I think it is pretty clear that storage rooms that are rarely occupied don't
need to be provided with ventilation air.  Yes, if the room is storing
something that emits or smells, I would hope that the designer would use
common sense and provide ventilation air, but if a space is only occupied
for very short periods of time, and not very often, it doesn't make sense to
go to the expense of installing a ventilation system, and spend $$ on
conditioning the ventilation air.

I am still not sure about corridors.  These are spaces that people commonly
go through, but actual average occupancy is very low.  In addition, the
ventilation requirements for corridors is low.  For a building that have
separate heating and cooling equipment in each zone, and no central air
system, does it really make sense to pipe 30 cfm of ventilation air to the
corridor?  What about naturally ventilated buildings?  Often the corridor
doesn't meet the requirements for natural venilation as it is in the core of
the building.  Are you going to add an entire ventilation system just for
the corridor?

I guess I'm more used to seeing buildings with all-air systems where the
30 cfm of extra ventilation air is a drop in the bucket.  Why not duct
some extra OA from the individual zonal systems to the corridor?  Or in
the case of naturally ventilated buildings, duct raw air with a small
unit heater, if needed.  Compared to the rest of the building, I can't
expect the operational cost of conditioning the air to be that high
given the small air quantities, although the capital cost for such a
small system might not be economical.  

 

At the end of the day, if this is a code issue, a building department
official should be able to provide some guidance.

In the equation in section 6.2.2.1, "Az" is defined as "zone floor area:
the net occupiable floor area of the zone"

and "occupiable space: an enclosed space intended for human activities,
excluding those spaces intended primarily for other purposes, such as
storage rooms and equipment rooms, that are only occupied occasionally
and for short periods of time."

I think it is pretty clear that storage rooms that are rarely occupied
don't need to be provided with ventilation air.  Yes, if the room is
storing something that emits or smells, I would hope that the designer
would use common sense and provide ventilation air, but if a space is
only occupied for very short periods of time, and not very often, it
doesn't make sense to go to the expense of installing a ventilation
system, and spend $$ on conditioning the ventilation air.

I am still not sure about corridors.  These are spaces that people
commonly go through, but actual average occupancy is very low.  In
addition, the ventilation requirements for corridors is low.  For a
building that have separate heating and cooling equipment in each zone,
and no central air system, does it really make sense to pipe 30 cfm of
ventilation air to the corridor?  What about naturally ventilated
buildings?  Often the corridor doesn't meet the requirements for natural
venilation as it is in the core of the building.  Are you going to add
an entire ventilation system just for the corridor?

Nick,

 

I agree that both a per-person and per-area rate must be calculated to
determine the total OA.  I have two comments though:

 

1.    In many jurisdictions, ASHRAE 62.1 is not suggested practice,
rather a code that must be met.  For example, all buildings built in
Ontario must be designed in accordance with 62.1.

 

2.    I don't think you could ever effectively argue that there are any
unoccupied spaces in a building, other than say mechanical shafts (I
clearly just contradicted myself...).  Although a storage room is not
regularly occupied, somebody will eventually have to store something in
it and at some point retrieve it.  

 

Regardless though, Pz in equation 6.2.2.1 applies only to the per-person
rate, which in the case of storage rooms and corridors is zero anyway,
so the zone outdoor airflow Vbz reduces to just the per-area rate x
area. Therefore, I think the per-area rate must always be supplied to
all spaces in the building during regularly occupied hours.  At night,
the ventilation system in the office building can be turned off, but
during normal office hours it should supply the total OA, which includes
OA for non-regularly occupied areas.  For multi-zone systems the total
OA is usually lower than the sum of all Vbz, to account for occupant
diversity and other system parameters. 

 

I think in reality, not all spaces are directly provided with ducted
ventilation air, and transfer air is often introduced via grilles in the
doorway.  Granted, one could question the effectiveness of that delivery
given the lack of exhaust fans to induce the air into the room as would
be the case in washrooms. Nonetheless, I've seen it done before.  

 

Cheers,

Note that Table 6-1 has "-" under the CFM/person values for ("General")
corridors, storage spaces, electrical rooms and similar spaces.  I
consider this ASHRAE's indirect guidance on spaces you can consider
"typically unoccupied" (Pz = 0) for the purposes of determining the
minimum OA rate.

Ok, this makes more sense.  What about corridors that have only
transient and very low occupancy rates?  Can this also be classified as
unoccupied?

I may be wrong, but it appears a number of people aren't examining the
equation in 6.2.2.1 as I'm suggesting.  If you'll check that out I'm
certain you'll find this is a much simpler question/answer than it's
being made out to be.

 

Both sets of figures provided in Table 6-1 (OA/person and OA/SF) are
used to determine the design minimum OA rate, using 6.2.2.1's equation.
Occupancy has no effect on the OA/SF requirement, and likewise zonal
area has no effect on the OA/person requirement.  Additionally, the
occupancy figure used is the maximum occupancy of that zone.  Quoting  
6.2.2.1:  "Pz = zone population: the largest number of people expected
to occupy the zone during typical usage..."  It is not the hourly
percentage occupancy and is not zero unless the space is never normally
occupied (as with a storage room like Karen suggested).

 

The design minimum OA rate is only applicable when the ventilation
system is operating.  Unless I'm missing something major, the
ventilation system is not required by ASHRAE 62.1 to operate 24 hours
per day  (again, refer to Section 5.4, which I've copied entirely
below).

 

 

I'll try to break down the current questions/statements on the table:

 

The reason I had the question was because I think OA/sqft technically
should not be dependent on occupancy...

That's a fair judgement a designer is allowed to make.  The 62.1
Standard is just that - not a code, but a set of suggestions provided by
some of those best qualified to provide them.  To play the devil's
advocate, the counter-argument is that Occupancy cannot be ignored by an
energy-conscious ventilation system designer.

 

...If that was the case, it would suffice to just increase the OA/sqft
and have only one number to take care of.

Someone doing that would be ignoring the equation Table 6-1 was built
around (re: 6.2.2.1).  I'd agree that would be a misinterpretation of
the standard.

 

What I am not sure of is whether OA/sqft is used only during the typical
occupied hours irrespective of whether it is actually occupied or not or
is it used throughtout the day/weekend/vacation etc.

OA/SF is always used alongside OA/person to determine the "breathing
zone outdoor airflow." (Which I've been calling the design minimum OA
rate).  The question of when these ventilation rates apply is tied to
when the zone is occupied.  To restate my position (Again Ref: Section
5.4):  ASHRAE 62.1 does not require that ventilation systems operate
during unoccupied times.

 

What do the hvac designers specify for the control of OA?

Not sure whether a concise answer can be provided to this broad
question... OA ventilation can be controlled by any combination of
scheduling/occupancy sensing/timer control/temperature/humidity/VOC,
CO2, CO or other air quality sensors... all depending on the project
budget, climate, and type of system being designed.  If this question
had a simple answer, then we wouldn't need HVAC designers =).

 

what happens when you have a space that is almost NEVER occupied, but
has a cfm/sf requirement - like a storage room with a requirement of
0.12 cfm/sf. 

See my answer above.

 

So do you need this ventilation rate only when the building is occupied,
only when the space is occupied, or all the time?

Strictly speaking, only when the zone (space) is occupied.  If you have
a one-zone system that doesn't distinguish between occupancy rates, then
whenever the building is occupied.

 

If you only need the ventilation when the space is occupied, and it is
almost never occupied, why install the ventilation in the first place?

This is a broad-scope question, so I'll add another quote under Section
1, entitled "PURPOSE:"

"1.1        The purpose of this standard is to specify minimum
ventilation rates and other measures intended to provide indoor air
quality that is acceptable to human occupants ant that minimizes adverse
health effects."

If a space is never occupied, then ASHRAE doesn't care about air
quality.  If a space is "almost never occupied," then they do.  To
continue your example, if you have a storage warehouse with no
ventilation installed, and it's almost never occupied, someone might
eventually store something in that space that without ventilation would
eventually cause a health hazard to the next occupant entering the
space.  In my college years, this was a commonly observed effect caused
on a small scale by my roommates forgetting food in the microwave =).

Ok, so here's a question - what happens when you have a space that is
almost NEVER occupied, but has a cfm/sf requirement - like a storage
room with a requirement of 0.12 cfm/sf.  This is a pretty high outdoor
airflow, especially if you're just storing old files.

So do you need this ventilation rate only when the building is occupied,
only when the space is occupied, or all the time?

If you only need the ventilation when the space is occupied, and it is
almost never occupied, why install the ventilation in the first place?

I havn't read the standard in detail, but isn't there a requirement of
some OA/sqft in addition to OA/person. 

 

You are correct.  Refer to the equation of Section 6.2.2.1 as I
referenced below.

 

Let's assume that an office is assumed normally occupied from 8 am to 6
pm -  Then during unoccupied hours (6.01 pm to 7.59 am) can the OA be
zero or should it be OA per sqft?

 

It sounds like you're asking the same question I just answered, so I may
not be understanding completely...  By Section 5.4 I do not believe an
unoccupied space is required to have any OA supplied.  The equation in
6.2.2.1 does include a component "per square foot," but that equation is
for determining the design minimum OA rate.

 

More tricky, let's say we have a occupancy sensor and know that the
office is unoccupied from 12.00 pm to 3 pm (during the regular office
times). What is the OA at this time - 0 or OA/sqft?

 

Applying the same logic and the same section, 5.4, if there are controls
that automatically determine a space is occupied and turn the associated
system on to provide the required OA, then there's no reason those
systems aren't allowed to turn off while unoccupied.  Short answer for
your example:  0.

 

I'll point out, I'm merely an E.I.T. (with my head in the books) sharing
my interpretations, so it may be worth holding out for a second opinion
=).

some OA/sqft in addition to OA/person.

No.

 

Refer to Section 5.4: 

"Mechanical ventilation systems shall include controls, manual or
automatic, that enable the fan system to operate whenever the spaces
served are occupied.  The system shall be designed to maintain the
minimum outdoor airflow as required by Section 6 under any load
condition."  

 

In summary, you must provided the minimum ventilation rate as prescribed
in Chapter 6 only when (A) the space is occupied and (B) there's a
thermal load condition (or manual control - see Section 5.4) triggering
the operation of the ventilation system.

 

Your original question is confusing to at least a few of us because of
stating an office ceases to be a "zone" at night...  It's a terminology
thing, but 62.1 and other standards will become more digestible to you
when you recognize that's not the case.  The clarification we're making
here is that where a zone occupancy (i.e. "office") is decided and a
constant over time, something like "occupancy rate" can be variable.

 

I'd like to also point out, based on your first inquiry, that the
equation at 6.2.2.1 uses maximum zone occupancy to establish the minimum
design OA rate, not the hourly occupancy rate (which may be zero).

Technically answering your question may not help you much.  You need to
make the question clearer and more meaningful.  Tell people what you are
trying to do, what is in your mind, and what you are trying to

Dear all, 

ASHARE 62.1 2007 deifned zone as an occupied space. Table 6-1 provides
the calculation for different spaces based on occupancy and floor area
of the occupied space. 

If we consider an unoccupied office space at night (i.e. not strictly a
"zone  anymore" ); is there any requirement to provide minimum fresh air
wihin the office space. 

Thanks in advance for your help

Luke and I are in full agreement, but I feel I should clarify a point
I've been trying to convey today.

 

I do feel you can argue a corridor for example is an "unoccupied space"
in the context of determining the OA requirements for a system.  More
directly stated, Pz=0 for the equation in 6.2.2.1.  We're all in
agreement that the CFM/SF values still apply to a corridor, of course.
When I say "unoccupied space" I'm not saying "zero outside air."  

 

While I've done projects around the country, I have had limited
experience with plan reviewers demanding to review my OA calcs (those
projects have been mainly in Arizona and California, to my
recollection).  I've yet to personally encounter someone actively
enforcing the 2007 version of 62.1, but I do rely on its suggested
practices whether the standard is adopted as a local code or not.  I
have successfully argued (maybe a better term is "presented a civil
discussion") for designing around more up-to-date ASHRAE 62.1 standards
where an older version is officially adopted.

Nick,

 

I agree that both a per-person and per-area rate must be calculated to
determine the total OA.  I have two comments though:

 

1.     In many jurisdictions, ASHRAE 62.1 is not suggested practice,
rather a code that must be met.  For example, all buildings built in
Ontario must be designed in accordance with 62.1.

 

2.     I don't think you could ever effectively argue that there are any
unoccupied spaces in a building, other than say mechanical shafts (I
clearly just contradicted myself...).  Although a storage room is not
regularly occupied, somebody will eventually have to store something in
it and at some point retrieve it.  

 

Regardless though, Pz in equation 6.2.2.1 applies only to the per-person
rate, which in the case of storage rooms and corridors is zero anyway,
so the zone outdoor airflow Vbz reduces to just the per-area rate x
area. Therefore, I think the per-area rate must always be supplied to
all spaces in the building during regularly occupied hours.  At night,
the ventilation system in the office building can be turned off, but
during normal office hours it should supply the total OA, which includes
OA for non-regularly occupied areas.  For multi-zone systems the total
OA is usually lower than the sum of all Vbz, to account for occupant
diversity and other system parameters. 

 

I think in reality, not all spaces are directly provided with ducted
ventilation air, and transfer air is often introduced via grilles in the
doorway.  Granted, one could question the effectiveness of that delivery
given the lack of exhaust fans to induce the air into the room as would
be the case in washrooms. Nonetheless, I've seen it done before.  

 

Cheers,

Note that Table 6-1 has "-" under the CFM/person values for ("General")
corridors, storage spaces, electrical rooms and similar spaces.  I
consider this ASHRAE's indirect guidance on spaces you can consider
"typically unoccupied" (Pz = 0) for the purposes of determining the
minimum OA rate.

Ok, this makes more sense.  What about corridors that have only
transient and very low occupancy rates?  Can this also be classified as
unoccupied?

I may be wrong, but it appears a number of people aren't examining the
equation in 6.2.2.1 as I'm suggesting.  If you'll check that out I'm
certain you'll find this is a much simpler question/answer than it's
being made out to be.

 

Both sets of figures provided in Table 6-1 (OA/person and OA/SF) are
used to determine the design minimum OA rate, using 6.2.2.1's equation.
Occupancy has no effect on the OA/SF requirement, and likewise zonal
area has no effect on the OA/person requirement.  Additionally, the
occupancy figure used is the maximum occupancy of that zone.  Quoting  
6.2.2.1:  "Pz = zone population: the largest number of people expected
to occupy the zone during typical usage..."  It is not the hourly
percentage occupancy and is not zero unless the space is never normally
occupied (as with a storage room like Karen suggested).

 

The design minimum OA rate is only applicable when the ventilation
system is operating.  Unless I'm missing something major, the
ventilation system is not required by ASHRAE 62.1 to operate 24 hours
per day  (again, refer to Section 5.4, which I've copied entirely
below).

 

 

I'll try to break down the current questions/statements on the table:

 

The reason I had the question was because I think OA/sqft technically
should not be dependent on occupancy...

That's a fair judgement a designer is allowed to make.  The 62.1
Standard is just that - not a code, but a set of suggestions provided by
some of those best qualified to provide them.  To play the devil's
advocate, the counter-argument is that Occupancy cannot be ignored by an
energy-conscious ventilation system designer.

 

...If that was the case, it would suffice to just increase the OA/sqft
and have only one number to take care of.

Someone doing that would be ignoring the equation Table 6-1 was built
around (re: 6.2.2.1).  I'd agree that would be a misinterpretation of
the standard.

 

What I am not sure of is whether OA/sqft is used only during the typical
occupied hours irrespective of whether it is actually occupied or not or
is it used throughtout the day/weekend/vacation etc.

OA/SF is always used alongside OA/person to determine the "breathing
zone outdoor airflow." (Which I've been calling the design minimum OA
rate).  The question of when these ventilation rates apply is tied to
when the zone is occupied.  To restate my position (Again Ref: Section
5.4):  ASHRAE 62.1 does not require that ventilation systems operate
during unoccupied times.

 

What do the hvac designers specify for the control of OA?

Not sure whether a concise answer can be provided to this broad
question... OA ventilation can be controlled by any combination of
scheduling/occupancy sensing/timer control/temperature/humidity/VOC,
CO2, CO or other air quality sensors... all depending on the project
budget, climate, and type of system being designed.  If this question
had a simple answer, then we wouldn't need HVAC designers =).

 

what happens when you have a space that is almost NEVER occupied, but
has a cfm/sf requirement - like a storage room with a requirement of
0.12 cfm/sf. 

See my answer above.

 

So do you need this ventilation rate only when the building is occupied,
only when the space is occupied, or all the time?

Strictly speaking, only when the zone (space) is occupied.  If you have
a one-zone system that doesn't distinguish between occupancy rates, then
whenever the building is occupied.

 

If you only need the ventilation when the space is occupied, and it is
almost never occupied, why install the ventilation in the first place?

This is a broad-scope question, so I'll add another quote under Section
1, entitled "PURPOSE:"

"1.1        The purpose of this standard is to specify minimum
ventilation rates and other measures intended to provide indoor air
quality that is acceptable to human occupants ant that minimizes adverse
health effects."

If a space is never occupied, then ASHRAE doesn't care about air
quality.  If a space is "almost never occupied," then they do.  To
continue your example, if you have a storage warehouse with no
ventilation installed, and it's almost never occupied, someone might
eventually store something in that space that without ventilation would
eventually cause a health hazard to the next occupant entering the
space.  In my college years, this was a commonly observed effect caused
on a small scale by my roommates forgetting food in the microwave =).

Ok, so here's a question - what happens when you have a space that is
almost NEVER occupied, but has a cfm/sf requirement - like a storage
room with a requirement of 0.12 cfm/sf.  This is a pretty high outdoor
airflow, especially if you're just storing old files.

I havn't read the standard in detail, but isn't there a requirement of
some OA/sqft in addition to OA/person. 

 

You are correct.  Refer to the equation of Section 6.2.2.1 as I
referenced below.

 

Let's assume that an office is assumed normally occupied from 8 am to 6
pm -  Then during unoccupied hours (6.01 pm to 7.59 am) can the OA be
zero or should it be OA per sqft?

 

It sounds like you're asking the same question I just answered, so I may
not be understanding completely...  By Section 5.4 I do not believe an
unoccupied space is required to have any OA supplied.  The equation in
6.2.2.1 does include a component "per square foot," but that equation is
for determining the design minimum OA rate.

 

More tricky, let's say we have a occupancy sensor and know that the
office is unoccupied from 12.00 pm to 3 pm (during the regular office
times). What is the OA at this time - 0 or OA/sqft?

 

Applying the same logic and the same section, 5.4, if there are controls
that automatically determine a space is occupied and turn the associated
system on to provide the required OA, then there's no reason those
systems aren't allowed to turn off while unoccupied.  Short answer for
your example:  0.

 

I'll point out, I'm merely an E.I.T. (with my head in the books) sharing
my interpretations, so it may be worth holding out for a second opinion
=).

Since we are on this topic, I had a question on definition of occupancy.

I havn't read the standard in detail, but isn't there a requirement of
some OA/sqft in addition to OA/person.

No.

 

Refer to Section 5.4: 

"Mechanical ventilation systems shall include controls, manual or
automatic, that enable the fan system to operate whenever the spaces
served are occupied.  The system shall be designed to maintain the
minimum outdoor airflow as required by Section 6 under any load
condition."  

 

In summary, you must provided the minimum ventilation rate as prescribed
in Chapter 6 only when (A) the space is occupied and (B) there's a
thermal load condition (or manual control - see Section 5.4) triggering
the operation of the ventilation system.

 

Your original question is confusing to at least a few of us because of
stating an office ceases to be a "zone" at night...  It's a terminology
thing, but 62.1 and other standards will become more digestible to you
when you recognize that's not the case.  The clarification we're making
here is that where a zone occupancy (i.e. "office") is decided and a
constant over time, something like "occupancy rate" can be variable.

 

I'd like to also point out, based on your first inquiry, that the
equation at 6.2.2.1 uses maximum zone occupancy to establish the minimum
design OA rate, not the hourly occupancy rate (which may be zero).

Michael, 

Technically answering your question may not help you much.  You need to
make the question clearer and more meaningful.  Tell people what you are
trying to do, what is in your mind, and what you are trying to
accomplish.  Then this group may help you more on the target.

Dear all, 

ASHARE 62.1 2007 deifned zone as an occupied space. Table 6-1 provides
the calculation for different spaces based on occupancy and floor area
of the occupied space. 

If we consider an unoccupied office space at night (i.e. not strictly a
"zone  anymore" ); is there any requirement to provide minimum fresh air
wihin the office space. 

Thanks in advance for your help

Message-ID: <D231D118CD37044D85938956832FFB7802399BBE@EXVS1.cdminc.internal.cdm.com>

We created an eQUEST model for a four-story office building with a total
area of 53,000 sq. ft for LEED certification. In the baseline model we
submitted to GBCI, we used System 5 (Packaged DX rooftop VAV w/reheat
and hot water fossil fuel boiler) as the primary system in per ASHRAE
90.1-2004 Table G3.1.1.A. At the same time, the single zone packaged
rooftop air-handling unit (PSZ) with constant volume and fossil fuel
furnace was utilized as baseline for the spaces including
telecommunication rooms  and electrical rooms since they had operating
schedule and peak thermal loads significantly different from other
office spaces by more than 10 Btu/Hr.Ft2. This was in accordance with
paragraph "Exceptions to G.3.1.1" on page 170 of ASHRAE Standard
90.1-2004. 

However, in the recent review comment we received from GBCI,  it was
addressed that System 5 "Packaged DX rooftop VAV w/ reheat and hot water
fossil fuel boiler" should have been modeled for ALL SPACES in the
baseline. No PSZ system should have been used in the baseline model. 

I am confused when the "Exceptions to G.3.1.1." of ASHRAE 90.1 - 2004
should apply if not in this case. Can anyone please share your
experience and advice? 

Thank you for any comments!

What you've done seems appropriate.  I would respond to the reviewer with
the information below, citing the sections of ASHRAE 90.1-2004.  The USGBC
reviewers are not infallible and sometimes make mistakes like this.

 

One comment though, make sure you have a PSZ system for each
telecom/electrical room.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Application - Telecommunication/Electrical Rooms
in Baseline Model

 

We created an eQUEST model for a four-story office building with a total
area of 53,000 sq. ft for LEED certification. In the baseline model we
submitted to GBCI, we used System 5 (Packaged DX rooftop VAV w/reheat and
hot water fossil fuel boiler) as the primary system in per ASHRAE
90.1-2004 Table G3.1.1.A. At the same time, the single zone packaged
rooftop air-handling unit (PSZ) with constant volume and fossil fuel
furnace was utilized as baseline for the spaces including
telecommunication rooms  and electrical rooms since they had operating
schedule and peak thermal loads significantly different from other office
spaces by more than 10 Btu/Hr.Ft2. This was in accordance with paragraph
"Exceptions to G.3.1.1" on page 170 of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004. 

However, in the recent review comment we received from GBCI,  it was
addressed that System 5 "Packaged DX rooftop VAV w/ reheat and hot water
fossil fuel boiler" should have been modeled for ALL SPACES in the
baseline. No PSZ system should have been used in the baseline model. 

I am confused when the "Exceptions to G.3.1.1." of ASHRAE 90.1 - 2004
should apply if not in this case. Can anyone please share your experience
and advice? 

Thank you for any comments!

I believe there is a minimum outdoor air requirement/sq.ft.  When there
is no occupancy, we can eliminate the CFM/person and keep only CFM/sq.ft.
Can any one else give some more advice on this please?

I don't know what section of 90.1 requires garage ventilation control
either.  Nathen's assumption that CO controlled garage ventilation fans
rarely run is correct.  We did a fair amount of M&V for a utility that
rebated CO control retrofits.  Significant savings were achieved.  Most
systems ran 24/7 and CO systems rarely operated.

I think if you clearly make the case for the baseline and take a
conservative estimate of the proposed, it will get accepted.  I was
preparing to submit a project in this manner when it went bankrupt and came

Blowing cellulose into uninsulated walls in Vermont also achieves

It is unclear to me if you are modeling a residential garage, where

fans?


Does anyone know if the GBCI reviewers are currently accepting ECMs
based off of garage carbon monoxide sensors to index garage fans? Or if
this can actually be included in the model with appropriate
explanation?

IMC requires constant ventilation for enclosed garages, but allows
CO-based systems to activate the fans. This equates to a substantial
energy savings since most systems like this only operate a few hours in
the morning, evening, and at lunch (other than the minimum 0.05 cfm / sq
ft continuous ventilation required by the IMC).

If we explain the system, and explain our assumptions for the use
schedules that dictate the proposed building fan schedules for the
garage, is this acceptable?

Do they require any backup support/studies for exactly how often the CO
levels will rise above acceptable limits, or is it sufficient to make a
conservative assumption that the garage fans will operate from 7-9am,
11-1pm, and 4-6pm at full load? In my engineering experience, CO-based
systems rarely run, and the circulation fans throughout the garage
(which approximate the continuous 0.05 cfm / sq ft requirements of the
IMC CO-based systems) are what really prevent isolated CO buildup.

Hello Sara,

You may want to read following article on energyplus help site.
http://energyplus.helpserve.com/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&_a=viewarticle&kbarticleid=5
.

You have two options

1. Avail yourself a meteonorm weather file, which is a workable option in
many scenarios. EnergyPlus support team can help you with getting Meteonorm
weather file.

2. You may want to search for a city which has weather characteristics as
close to Mecca as possible. For doing this, you could use weather city tool
on following link http://www.vibyor.com/weather-tool

Hope one of the options helps you.

Regards
Deepak Agrawal

Dear all,

I would kindly ask for an information please regarding TRACE v. 4.1.1; v 6.2.4

1) How can I trick TRACE to handle double facades with an imposed airflow in the air gap?
2) Any idea on how to model semi transparent PV window along with electricity generated?
3) Any general advise on modeling 56 story? building? using TRACE for LEED compliance in EA section?? e.g. should I consider zone-by-zone approach with defining all envelope, HVAC systems or treat typical floor as a single zone , perhaps?


Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
Thanks, Sasa

approach to enhancing existing buildings in an effort to identify and reduce
energy waste. The focus will be on public assembly spaces, offices, public
order, and public safety spaces.

Class Topics Include:
* Improvement-driven modeling in existing buildings
* Simple meter arrangements in complex HVAC systems
* Trued-up modeling

Dates: December 8 & 9, 2009
Location: Sheraton Suites, Weehauken, NJ
Cost: $750 for 2 days, includes lunch

Sasa,

In response to your query I've provide some comments in the same order.


1)      TRACE cannot credibly model a double skin fa?ade.  Any reasonable reviewer should challenge the use of this software in this application (it has many strengths that can serve you elsewhere).  There are other tools that would be more appropriate such as Energy+, IES-VE, TRNSYS, and various combinations of these using bulk air flow models in conjunction (we've even used CONTAM, TRNSYS, eQUEST together).

2)      You're probably best off modeling the PV window as a window using its published performance values (SHGC, u-value, Tvis) and using another tool to assess the output of the PV, which can be easily applied in the LEED template as a renewable energy credit.

3)      You should definitely not treat the typical floor as a single zone.  This is not an appropriate way to model a typical high rise.  You can simplify based on zone/space characteristics, but distinct thermal zone types (space utilization, perimeter vs core, orientation) should be modeled separately.  What you may choose to do would be to model the ground floor, top floor, and typical floors in between, with each of the same type of typical floor zone areas modeled together (i.e. all west fa?ade perimeter office zones modeled as one very long floor area and wall area, all interior restrooms modeled as one large restroom, etc.).  This is possible since TRACE is non-geometric.  However, I would go back to my response to #1 if a double skin fa?ade is being incorporated into the design.

Paul

Dear all,

I would kindly ask for an information please regarding TRACE v. 4.1.1; v 6.2.4

1) How can I trick TRACE to handle double facades with an imposed airflow in the air gap?
2) Any idea on how to model semi transparent PV window along with electricity generated?
3) Any general advise on modeling 56 story  building  using TRACE for LEED compliance in EA section?  e.g. should I consider zone-by-zone approach with defining all envelope, HVAC systems or treat typical floor as a single zone , perhaps?


Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
Thanks, Sasa

This is not my understanding.   ASHRAE 62 defines ventilation is for 
acceptable air quality.  When the space is unoccupied, there is no 
requirement for ventilation.

	COMMENT)
Message-ID: <20091118083842.GA64934@mail19h.g19.rapidsite.net>

Hello Everyone,

 

Presently I am working on LEED NC V2.2 projects. My project is Office &
Warehouse; I received a comment from USGBC on EAc1 - Optimized Energy
Performance.

 

Comment:

It is unclear that Fan power is according to ASHRAE G3.1.2.9. Please provide
the detailed calculations. Please revise the sum of the supply, return,
exhaust (including Warehouse ventilation) and relief fans for each HVAC
system to be equal to the power calculated in G3.1.2.9. 

 

Submitted data:

I have incorporated Fan details as per ASHRAE G3.1.2.9 in Energy Modeling
software (Visual DOE). But I need more clearance about the comment.

 

Explanation required:

As per my knowledge, Energy Modeling HVAC System Summary Calculations is
different with from Actual HVAC Load calculations. Also CFM, Cooling
Capacity, Fan Power Consumption, Total Power Consumption differs from
actual. How to incorporate Exhaust ventilation fans energy?

 

It would be appreciated if I get full details about ASHRAE G3.1.2.9 and
recommendations of LEED. 

 

Thanks & regards,

Ashraf

Ashraf,
 
Your reviewer is asking you to demonstrate that you used ASHRAE
90.1-2004, Appendix G section G3.1.2.9 to calculate the fan energy in
your Baseline model.
You could supply a spreadsheet showing each system and the calculated
fan power. I don't know what the "HVAC System Summary" is in the
Explanation Required part of your message, so I can't address that part.
If you're concerned about how/if you should split fan power into
individual fans in each system, you can search the Bldg-sim Archive for
more specific advice:

All,

There is a credit in LEED (EQc2.0) that involves increasing the required
ventilation rate by 30%.  In trying to achieve this credit, the amount
of energy would have to increase to condition that additional 30% OSA.
Does anyone know if you are supposed to increase the baseline energy
model's ventilation rate so it has the same ventilation rate as the
proposed building?  Thank you in advance for your help.

In  my experience you do not increase the baseline energy model as you
are being awarded (gaining that point) when you achieve the ventilation
credit. There are a few similar situations in LEED where by achieving
one credit will prevent you from achieving another but this happens to
everyone so it works out to be somewhat fair.

Steven, I would apply the same ventilation rates to both baseline and proposed
check appendix G.3.1.2.5 - it says minimum OA rates have to be consistent in the two models.

I disagree, I believe the models should be same-same on ventilation rates.
See section 90.1 (2004) Section G3.1.2.5. It states:

 

"Minimum outdoor air ventilation rates should be the same for the proposed
and baseline building designs."

 

In my projects (including those that include 30% additional outside air),
I have always used the same outdoor air flow rates, unless I was taking
credit for demand control ventilation in the proposed case (see the
exception allowed in that same ASHRAE section).

In  my experience you do not increase the baseline energy model as you
are being awarded (gaining that point) when you achieve the ventilation
credit. There are a few similar situations in LEED where by achieving
one credit will prevent you from achieving another but this happens to
everyone so it works out to be somewhat fair.

All,

There is a credit in LEED (EQc2.0) that involves increasing the required
ventilation rate by 30%.  In trying to achieve this credit, the amount
of energy would have to increase to condition that additional 30% OSA.
Does anyone know if you are supposed to increase the baseline energy
model's ventilation rate so it has the same ventilation rate as the
proposed building?  Thank you in advance for your help.

Yes, I guess I should have been more clear, but that is the ONLY way my
projects have been accepted by LEED reviewers. 

 

In the end, I suppose the reviewer very well might allow you to use more
OA in the proposed since it would disadvantage the proposed energy usage,
and hence energy cost savings. That being said, I'm sure somebody on this
list can come up with a scenario where this would give an advantage to the
proposed design.

building and had success going through the LEED acceptance process using
the same outdoor air flow rates for both baseline and proposed?

I disagree, I believe the models should be same-same on ventilation rates.
See section 90.1 (2004) Section G3.1.2.5. It states:

 

"Minimum outdoor air ventilation rates should be the same for the proposed
and baseline building designs."

 

In my projects (including those that include 30% additional outside air),
I have always used the same outdoor air flow rates, unless I was taking
credit for demand control ventilation in the proposed case (see the
exception allowed in that same ASHRAE section).

I always assumed that if you went to 30% extra, you kept the baseline at
100%, and the designed building at 130%, but after reading this, it does
seem to make sense that you would increase both occurrences. 

 

Can anyone from the EA Tag chime in?

Quick answer:

Long answer:

These are separate credits - the modeling takes place based on the proposed design in comparison to a baseline that is only restricted by 90.1.  The OA requirement should be the same in both models subject to any DCV or exceptional calcs or technologies.  This is not affected by other LEED credits.

The credit for increased ventilation takes place "before" modeling starts.  This is besides the many cases for laboratories or hospitals where the local code ventilation requirements are much greater than ASHRAE 62.1 already - the proposed design is in effect already taking the EAC1 penalty but earning the credit for increased ventilation under the best practice design.  You wouldn't relax the baseline ventilation to less than 30% in these cases!

I'm sure there are some proposed buildings out there that condition OA very effectively, and may gain EAC1 gross energy cost savings by having increased ventilation, but even where that effect occurs there is  the question of percentage savings applying to a larger energy consumption and cost.

Overall if you gain EAC1 points by pursuing increased ventilation, I think you have worked well within the system - good for you in designing a system to condition outside air so effectively.

Invitation to a London workshop on

"The management of thermal performance risks in buildings subject to climate change"


Date: Tuesday 8 December 2009-10-06
Time: 18:00 - 21:30ish
Location: University College London, The Bartlett


This workshop takes place in the context of an EPSRC-funded research project. The aim of the research is to introduces risk and risk acceptance into the discussion of adapting buildings to climate change. Initial results will be presented to co-researchers, and to facility managers/engineers from practice. The ensuing discussion will cover ongoing efforts in the field, and specifically invites stakeholders to provide a steer on the approach taken. Special guest of the workshop is Jake Hacker of ARUP of CIBSE TM36 fame.

Programme:
18:00-18:30               Welcome, research project presentation (background, initial results, issues of interest)
18:30-19:15               Discussion, brainstorming on challenges in the field and how to move forward
19:15-19:30               Summary/closing
19:30-                         Networking, informal discussions (drinks and snacks provided)

If you would like to attend, please email us at pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk<mailto:pieter.dewilde at plymouth.ac.uk> before 26 November 2009.
This will allow us so to prepare a list of partipants, and to arrange the right amount of catering.

"These are separate credits - the modeling takes place based on the
proposed design in comparison to a baseline that is only restricted by
90.1."

 

This is absolutely correct. The credit is separate and therefore becomes
part of your design regardless of EAc1. Once part of your design you are
required to follow the guidelines of 90.1 which says to keep the same
ventilation rate schedules.

 

Also the increased ventilation is not always a penalty on the energy
side by comparison. DOAS can have increased ventilation and still use
less energy when utilizing a double wheel system.

I always assumed that if you went to 30% extra, you kept the baseline at
100%, and the designed building at 130%, but after reading this, it does
seem to make sense that you would increase both occurrences. 

 

Can anyone from the EA Tag chime in?

I disagree, I believe the models should be same-same on ventilation
rates. See section 90.1 (2004) Section G3.1.2.5. It states:

 

"Minimum outdoor air ventilation rates should be the same for the
proposed and baseline building designs."

 

In my projects (including those that include 30% additional outside
air), I have always used the same outdoor air flow rates, unless I was
taking credit for demand control ventilation in the proposed case (see
the exception allowed in that same ASHRAE section).

In  my experience you do not increase the baseline energy model as you
are being awarded (gaining that point) when you achieve the ventilation
credit. There are a few similar situations in LEED where by achieving
one credit will prevent you from achieving another but this happens to
everyone so it works out to be somewhat fair.

All,

There is a credit in LEED (EQc2.0) that involves increasing the required
ventilation rate by 30%.  In trying to achieve this credit, the amount
of energy would have to increase to condition that additional 30% OSA.
Does anyone know if you are supposed to increase the baseline energy
model's ventilation rate so it has the same ventilation rate as the
proposed building?  Thank you in advance for your help.

This is a case of where LEED, IMHO, should supersede 90.1.  I'm very
surprised, and quite frankly disappointed, about Nathan's comments that
the USGBC has accepted 30% over-ventilation in the baseline building.
The intent of LEED, among other things, is to promote low-energy
building design.  If a designer chooses to over-ventilate a building by
30% over what is required by ASHRAE in order to achieve better indoor
air quality, the occupants are better off, the environment is not.  

 

The bottom-line is that the baseline building "could" have been
ventilated at ASHRAE rates, and the proposed design should be penalized
for not complying with accepted practice.  It's no different than if the
proposed chiller had a lower COP compared to 90.1 baseline. 90.1 and
ASHRAE define currently accepted practice and the proposed design should
be judged against the standard, not against itself.  It's just that in
this case there is a side-benefit of using more energy and 90.1
stipulates using the same ventilation rates, which muddies the issue.

 

I think the example of the hospital is a red herring, since hospitals
would not be designed to ASHRAE 90.1, rather more stringent ventilation
codes which would be applied to both the reference and proposed
buildings.  The result is compliance-neutral.  Choosing to ventilate
beyond governing standards, should be considered bad design practice in
terms of energy, even though it's considered good design practice for
other reasons. We can't have our cake and eat it too!

Quick answer:

 

90.1 does not care if you are pursuing EQC2, use the same OA quantities
in baseline and proposed for EAC1.

 

 

Long answer:

 

These are separate credits - the modeling takes place based on the
proposed design in comparison to a baseline that is only restricted by
90.1.  The OA requirement should be the same in both models subject to
any DCV or exceptional calcs or technologies.  This is not affected by
other LEED credits.  

 

The credit for increased ventilation takes place "before" modeling
starts.  This is besides the many cases for laboratories or hospitals
where the local code ventilation requirements are much greater than
ASHRAE 62.1 already - the proposed design is in effect already taking
the EAC1 penalty but earning the credit for increased ventilation under
the best practice design.  You wouldn't relax the baseline ventilation
to less than 30% in these cases!

 

I'm sure there are some proposed buildings out there that condition OA
very effectively, and may gain EAC1 gross energy cost savings by having
increased ventilation, but even where that effect occurs there is  the
question of percentage savings applying to a larger energy consumption
and cost.

 

Overall if you gain EAC1 points by pursuing increased ventilation, I
think you have worked well within the system - good for you in designing
a system to condition outside air so effectively.  For many projects
(other than labs or hospitals which may have to use that quantity of OA
anyway) I would expect EQC2 could be trading for an EAC1 credit, so
you'll have to prioritize.  Both are rewarded from USGBC, but EAC1 is
also rewarded in lower utility bills.

Under current LEED EAc1/ASHRAE 90.1:  Use the same ventilation rate in both
base and design cases, with a few limited exceptions (read the CIRs about
lab air change rates, etc.)

This will likely evolve for LEED 2012.

Luka,

I agree with your sense of disappointment.  Although I'm not convinced
62.1 provides sufficient OSA for ventilation in some cases and provides
over ventilation at times, the intent of 90.1 is to reduce energy
consumption.  Even though I generally prefer to provide more than the
minimum OSA mandated in 62.1, the intent of LEED is to promote reducing
energy consumption in buildings.  Providing OSA rates greater than the
rates directed in 62.1 typically requires spending a bit more time with
design in order to minimize the impact of the additional ventilation
air.  It is reasonable to assume that LEED should recognize buildings
provided with more than the minimum OSA required to meet 62.1 should
either require creative means to minimize the energy impact of
additional ventilation or be penalized for increasing the ventilation
rate.

very effectively, and may gain EAC1 gross energy cost savings by having
increased ventilation, but even where that effect occurs there is  the
question of percentage savings applying to a larger energy consumption
and cost.

 

Overall if you gain EAC1 points by pursuing increased ventilation, I
think you have worked well within the system - good for you in designing
a system to condition outside air so effectively.  For many projects
(other than labs or hospitals which may have to use that quantity of OA
anyway) I would expect EQC2 could be trading for an EAC1 credit, so
you'll have to prioritize.  Both are rewarded from USGBC, but EAC1 is
also rewarded in lower utility bills.

I always assumed that if you went to 30% extra, you kept the baseline at
100%, and the designed building at 130%, but after reading this, it does
seem to make sense that you would increase both occurrences. 

 

Can anyone from the EA Tag chime in?

I disagree, I believe the models should be same-same on ventilation
rates. See section 90.1 (2004) Section G3.1.2.5. It states:

 

"Minimum outdoor air ventilation rates should be the same for the
proposed and baseline building designs."

 

In my projects (including those that include 30% additional outside
air), I have always used the same outdoor air flow rates, unless I was
taking credit for demand control ventilation in the proposed case (see
the exception allowed in that same ASHRAE section).

In  my experience you do not increase the baseline energy model as you
are being awarded (gaining that point) when you achieve the ventilation
credit. There are a few similar situations in LEED where by achieving
one credit will prevent you from achieving another but this happens to
everyone so it works out to be somewhat fair.

All,

There is a credit in LEED (EQc2.0) that involves increasing the required
ventilation rate by 30%.  In trying to achieve this credit, the amount
of energy would have to increase to condition that additional 30% OSA.
Does anyone know if you are supposed to increase the baseline energy
model's ventilation rate so it has the same ventilation rate as the
proposed building?  Thank you in advance for your help.

To the best of my knowledge, the requirement for OA is ONLY when the 
zone is occupied. And yes, it includes both a CFM per person component 
and a CFM per Sq. Ft. component. But they ONLY APPLY when the zone is 
occupied. Please note that for systems serving zones in normal 
applications, this is during times when the building is occupied, like 
normal business hours or whenever the HVAC system is running for 
building conditioning. There are special cases, like after-hours heat 
removal when, if nobody is in the building, you don't need outside air, 
but that is an unusual case.

Also please note that in some places, like California, there is an 
absolute minimum, even with CO2 monitors, based on square footage, but 
that isn't in 62.1.

To add to this the ECB subcommittee of ASHRAE 90.1 has ruled an interpretation restating that the ventilation requirements of G3.1.2.5 are "energy neutral." Otherwise stated the total ventilation requirement (i.e. building total outdoor air intake flow) for the proposed model must be the same as the baseline model.

Continuous low level exhaust can ensure your occupied space is positive and the garage is negative, especially under apartments that are not directly mechanically ventilated.

Can anyone show me a section of an ASHRAE or other code that prohibits the continuous ventilation of a garage?

I respect USGBC/GBCI's authority to make determinations for their ratings systems; such as method(s) of determining savings for CO control of garage fans.
However, they need to take ownership of those determinations and apply them consistently and transparently.

I don't know what section of 90.1 requires garage ventilation control either.  Nathen's assumption that CO controlled garage ventilation fans rarely run is correct.  We did a fair amount of M&V for a utility that rebated CO control retrofits.  Significant savings were achieved.  Most systems ran 24/7 and CO systems rarely operated.

I think if you clearly make the case for the baseline and take a conservative estimate of the proposed, it will get accepted.  I was preparing to submit a project in this manner when it went bankrupt and came to a halt!

I know this is a contentious issue on bldg-sim regarding whether this should be a allowable measure or not.

I can tell you that on a recent office building project (LEED-NC v2.2) we submitted for energy savings from garage CO sensors. The only comment we got from the reviewer was that "ASHRAE mandates some sort of timed control or CO control as part of the mandatory measures," so we couldn't compare against a 24/7 constant volume system. I wish they had quoted a specific section of 90.1 for clarity.

We switched the baseline system to be off for ~6 hours during the night (not in agreement with the IMC requirement for continuous air movement), and they accepted our energy savings.

Our proposed case simply had the fans on a VFD and we created a custom schedule, which we presented to the reviewer, to reflect that the fans typically were at their lowest setting, and only ramped up for peak commuting hours (small peaks for morning and lunch, big peak at end of the day when all the cold engines start up and really put out the CO).

It is unclear to me if you are modeling a residential garage, where there may genuinely be 24/7 use, if you get to compare to a 24/7 constant volume system.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] GBCI approval of carbon monoxide control of garage fans?

Does anyone know if the GBCI reviewers are currently accepting ECMs based off of garage carbon monoxide sensors to index garage fans?  Or if this can actually be included in the model with appropriate explanation?

IMC requires constant ventilation for enclosed garages, but allows CO-based systems to activate the fans.  This equates to a substantial energy savings since most systems like this only operate a few hours in the morning, evening, and at lunch (other than the minimum 0.05 cfm / sq ft continuous ventilation required by the IMC).

If we explain the system, and explain our assumptions for the use schedules that dictate the proposed building fan schedules for the garage, is this acceptable?

Do they require any backup support/studies for exactly how often the CO levels will rise above acceptable limits, or is it sufficient to make a conservative assumption that the garage fans will operate from 7-9am, 11-1pm, and 4-6pm at full load?  In my engineering experience, CO-based systems rarely run, and the circulation fans throughout the garage (which approximate the continuous 0.05 cfm / sq ft requirements of the IMC CO-based systems) are what really prevent isolated CO buildup.

Dear Friends,

Is there any specific schedule (type fraction) specified by ASHRAE that can
be used for CO tracking in the basement using VFD fans?

In this case to claim saving I am thinking of using constant volume fans for
the baseline building basement with schedule fraction =1 for 24 hrs and 
use VFD fans for the proposed building basement with Schedule fraction less
than 1 and varying for 24 hrs.

Right now for proposed building iam thinking of using following fraction for
24 hrs based on the timing when people will be coming in and going out of
the office building.

"Day Schedule fraction" = DAY-SCHEDULE-PD
   TYPE             = FRACTION
   VALUES           = (0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.75, 1, 1, 0.75,
0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3)

Just wanted to confirm if there are any specific fractions that ASHRAE
specifies to be used for the VFD fans to claim saving over the constant
volume fans so that savings can be claimed for CO tracking in the basement.

To add to this the ECB subcommittee of ASHRAE 90.1 has ruled an
interpretation restating that the ventilation requirements of G3.1.2.5 are
"energy neutral." Otherwise stated the total ventilation requirement (i.e.
building total outdoor air intake flow) for the proposed model must be the
same as the baseline model.

Under current LEED EAc1/ASHRAE 90.1:  Use the same ventilation rate in both

This will likely evolve for LEED 2012.

I disagree, I believe the models should be same-same on ventilation rates.
See section 90.1 (2004) Section G3.1.2.5. It states:

"Minimum outdoor air ventilation rates should be the same for the proposed
and baseline building designs."

In my projects (including those that include 30% additional outside air), I
have always used the same outdoor air flow rates, unless I was taking credit
for demand control ventilation in the proposed case (see the exception
allowed in that same ASHRAE section).

In  my experience you do not increase the baseline energy model as you are
being awarded (gaining that point) when you achieve the ventilation credit.
There are a few similar situations in LEED where by achieving one credit
will prevent you from achieving another but this happens to everyone so it
works out to be somewhat fair.

All,
There is a credit in LEED (EQc2.0) that involves increasing the required
ventilation rate by 30%.  In trying to achieve this credit, the amount of
energy would have to increase to condition that additional 30% OSA.  Does
anyone know if you are supposed to increase the baseline energy model's
ventilation rate so it has the same ventilation rate as the proposed
building?  Thank you in advance for your help.

Continuous low level exhaust can ensure your occupied space is positive and
the garage is negative, especially under apartments that are not directly
mechanically ventilated.

Can anyone show me a section of an ASHRAE or other code that prohibits the
continuous ventilation of a garage?

I respect USGBC/GBCI's authority to make determinations for their ratings
systems; such as method(s) of determining savings for CO control of garage
fans.
However, they need to take ownership of those determinations and apply them
consistently and transparently.

I don't know what section of 90.1 requires garage ventilation control
either.  Nathen's assumption that CO controlled garage ventilation fans
rarely run is correct.  We did a fair amount of M&V for a utility that
rebated CO control retrofits.  Significant savings were achieved.  Most
systems ran 24/7 and CO systems rarely operated.

I think if you clearly make the case for the baseline and take a
conservative estimate of the proposed, it will get accepted.  I was
preparing to submit a project in this manner when it went bankrupt and came
to a halt!

I know this is a contentious issue on bldg-sim regarding whether this should
be a allowable measure or not.

I can tell you that on a recent office building project (LEED-NC v2.2) we
submitted for energy savings from garage CO sensors. The only comment we got
from the reviewer was that "ASHRAE mandates some sort of timed control or CO
control as part of the mandatory measures," so we couldn't compare against a
24/7 constant volume system. I wish they had quoted a specific section of
90.1 for clarity.

We switched the baseline system to be off for ~6 hours during the night (not
in agreement with the IMC requirement for continuous air movement), and they
accepted our energy savings.

Our proposed case simply had the fans on a VFD and we created a custom
schedule, which we presented to the reviewer, to reflect that the fans
typically were at their lowest setting, and only ramped up for peak
commuting hours (small peaks for morning and lunch, big peak at end of the
day when all the cold engines start up and really put out the CO).

It is unclear to me if you are modeling a residential garage, where there
may genuinely be 24/7 use, if you get to compare to a 24/7 constant volume
system.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] GBCI approval of carbon monoxide control of garage fans?

Does anyone know if the GBCI reviewers are currently accepting ECMs based
off of garage carbon monoxide sensors to index garage fans?  Or if this can
actually be included in the model with appropriate explanation?

IMC requires constant ventilation for enclosed garages, but allows CO-based
systems to activate the fans.  This equates to a substantial energy savings
since most systems like this only operate a few hours in the morning,
evening, and at lunch (other than the minimum 0.05 cfm / sq ft continuous
ventilation required by the IMC).

If we explain the system, and explain our assumptions for the use schedules
that dictate the proposed building fan schedules for the garage, is this
acceptable?

Do they require any backup support/studies for exactly how often the CO
levels will rise above acceptable limits, or is it sufficient to make a
conservative assumption that the garage fans will operate from 7-9am,
11-1pm, and 4-6pm at full load?  In my engineering experience, CO-based
systems rarely run, and the circulation fans throughout the garage (which
approximate the continuous 0.05 cfm / sq ft requirements of the IMC CO-based
systems) are what really prevent isolated CO buildup.

As far as I know, you can take credit for this for LEED EAc1. The credit
is based on energy cost and not BTUs, so assuming you have a TOU  rate
structure, you should show some savings there. There are potentially
some significant environmental benefits from peak shavings too - most
utilities have larger plants that run full time for a base load. They
then supply the additional loads with peaking plants - either natural
gas or diesel powered. Cutting demand reduces the need for peakers to
come online. 

 

 

 

 

Of course - Coal power is the ultimate in peak shaving ;-)

Sorry to post this here, but figured this was the best place to ask this
question.  We're starting to use Trace more and more for energy
modeling, now that it does things like ASHRAE 62 calcs and Fan Power
calcs automatically.  However, the biggest stumbling block right now is
that we all have individual licenses for Trace, and so we have to
remember to continuously export / import custom libraries.  This is a
pain, but I don't think we can make a network version of Trace run on
our system at the speed we need.

 

Is there a way to "bind" libraries to a project file?

 

Ideally we want a company-wide library with utility rate structures,
glass types, etc that we continuously add to, and that gets bound to all
new project files so that we don't have to mess with exporting and
importing libraries.

 

Is this possible?

James,

Depending on what version of Trace you have, you should be able to "archive" your project files.  The archive option presents itself on the start-up screen.  If you don't see this option on your startup screen then you have an older version of Trace.

When you archive a project file it binds your individual library to the project file.  Then, when someone opens up your archived Trace file the libraries are merged onto that computer.

Be careful though, when you merge libraries, and if you have duplicate file names, it will erase your original file name and replace it with what was on the archive file.  For instance, if your Trace file has a construction type called "4" Face Brick" and the archive file has an identical construction type it will erase your "4" Face Brick" and replace it with what is on the archive file.

Hope this helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Trace custom libraries

Sorry to post this here, but figured this was the best place to ask this question.  We're starting to use Trace more and more for energy modeling, now that it does things like ASHRAE 62 calcs and Fan Power calcs automatically.  However, the biggest stumbling block right now is that we all have individual licenses for Trace, and so we have to remember to continuously export / import custom libraries.  This is a pain, but I don't think we can make a network version of Trace run on our system at the speed we need.

Is there a way to "bind" libraries to a project file?

Ideally we want a company-wide library with utility rate structures, glass types, etc that we continuously add to, and that gets bound to all new project files so that we don't have to mess with exporting and importing libraries.

Is this possible?

Thanks in advance,

In the last year or so our company upgraded to the network version of Trace.  That way all our libraries are shared.  BUT you still should archive your file so that if you come back to the file at a later date, and someone changed something in the library (which they shouldn't do, we typically create a new library member instead of changing an existing one), then you still have the library files from the archived file to make your  file run properly.

Another problem with Trace is that, even with the network version, you can't run the file on the network.  You have to run it on your own computer and then remember to archive and upload the .taf and .trc files to the network so the latest version is available in case others need to access it.  If you have multiple people working on the project it may get difficult to keep track of the newest and most updated version since there will be multiple copies.

James,

Depending on what version of Trace you have, you should be able to "archive" your project files.  The archive option presents itself on the start-up screen.  If you don't see this option on your startup screen then you have an older version of Trace.

When you archive a project file it binds your individual library to the project file.  Then, when someone opens up your archived Trace file the libraries are merged onto that computer.

Be careful though, when you merge libraries, and if you have duplicate file names, it will erase your original file name and replace it with what was on the archive file.  For instance, if your Trace file has a construction type called "4" Face Brick" and the archive file has an identical construction type it will erase your "4" Face Brick" and replace it with what is on the archive file.

Hope this helps.

Hi James,
Archiving is the way to go!  Another emailer mentioned that depending on your version of Trace you may not have archiving ability.  Archiving has been around for eons.  So, it shouldn't be a problem doing it even if you have an older version.  I think the later versions just moved an archiving button to the start up screen.  If for some reason the archiving option does not show up on your start up screen, you can always access this ability on the pull down file menu.

A tip for creating library members:  never edit the basic library members.  If you need to create a custom library member, start with a basic one and create a copy of it (or create one from scratch) .  Then rename it using the job name or number in the title of that library member.  That makes it easy to identify which library members are associated with each job and also prevents/minimizes the chances of inadvertently copying over a custom library with a subsequent version that may be used on other projects.  

Also, if you haven't already done so, you may also want to consider creating global templates (as opposed to library members) that you can use on multiple projects.  Global templates are very handy and can save a lot of time if you do a lot of similar types of projects.  (Although, this is more true for doing load calcs as opposed to energy modeling).  The Trace help menu can walk you through it.  If you do not create a template as a global template it will only be associated with your project file (but it will come along with the file when you archive it). 

Julia

Call for Software Demos - eSim 2010 

IBPSA-Canada's biennial conference, eSim, brings together professionals,
academics and students interested in building performance simulation
issues and applications. The 2010 conference is hosted by Manitoba
Hydro, in collaboration with the National Research Council of Canada. It
will be held in Winnipeg, Canada on May 19 and 20, 2010 (pre-conference
and post-conference workshops on May 18 and 21, 2010).

 

Software companies and individuals are invited to take part in special
software demos sessions during the conference. Much like technical
presentations, the software demos sessions will consist of presentations
in front of an audience. However, these presentations will not be
peer-reviewed and therefore not included in the conference proceedings -
although the submission of a technical paper on the software that meets
one of the conference themes is encouraged! To be eligible for a
presentation during the software demo sessions, the software must be a
commercial product or be freely available (on a web site for example).
Furthermore, the presenter must be a registered participant. Please note
that the scientific committee has the right to limit the number of
software tools being presented.

 

The deadline to submit a software application is December 4, 2009. To
submit, just click on the "Software Demo Submission" tab on www.esim.ca

Dear SimAUD Community,

Due to the Thanksgiving Holiday in the United States, we have received several requests to extend the SimAUD deadline.   As such, we have agreed with the hosting SCS and SpringSim organizations to extend the deadline by one week to December 4th, 2009.  This update will be noted on the News<http://www.simaud.org/news.php> page of the SimAUD website later today.

We greatly appreciate the efforts of all the authors who have already submitted their full papers and we hope that this extension will allow researchers who have data sets that would benefit the community to submit Data Sets as well.

Many thanks and Happy Thanksgiving,

Azam
General Chair, SimAUD 2010 Organizing Committee

Hi All,
           I am doing one building located in kochi  when i checked
the ashrae it says that  add 10F approach to WBT  and compare it with
85F  and which ever is lower take it as  condenser water entering
temperature.

But there is no direct input available for condenser water entering
temperature input available are for WBT and approach suppose my WBT is
78F and i take 10F approach as mentioned in ashrae  then my condenser
water temperature becomes 88F which is greater than 85F but i have to
take condenser water temperature as 85F only, because 88>85 as per
ashrae.Then my  doubt  is that i have to options to make condenser
water temperature 85 F

1: i should keep the WBT as it is same value ie 78F and reduce the
approach from 10F to 7F such that my condenser water temperature
becomes 78+7=85F or

2: i should keep the approach same as 10F and change the WBT from 78
to 75 such that my condenser water temperature becomes 75+10=85F

which way should i go .

Thanks

It seems to me that a roof that emits more radiation will have a greater
warming effect on the building. Some houses in warm climates have radiant
barriers because the aluminum has a *low* emissivity, thus blocking the
infrared radiation. But both LEED and Energy Star suggest high emissivity
for warm climates. Does this make sense?

Brad.

This would be the best for hot climates, and there are many materials that do this. In fact, most materials have a high emissivity, which is a surface property.

A surface with a low emissivity traps heat, for example for use on a flat plate collector (i.e., high absorptance, low emissivity).

Yes, it makes sense.  High emissivity allows a roof to radiate its stored heat to the sky, thus aiding the cooling effect, so, yes, good for hot climates!

Note also that ASHRAE 90.1 gives credit for (i.e., relaxes) the U-Factor requirement for such roofs in climate zones 1, 2 and 3 (the warmest zones).  The ASHRAE Standard uses the term "High Albedo" for roofs with high reflectance AND high emissivity -- this is addressed in Section 5.5.3.1.1 and Table 5.5.3.1 in the 2007 version.

Remember that emissivity and absorptivity are generally equal and often 
vary with wavelength. And for opaque materials, emissivity generally 
equals (1- reflectivity) at a given wavelength.

So it would be possible to have a spectrally selective roof which 
reflected the sun's visible and short wave infrared energy well (high 
reflectance, low emittance) but also radiated energy well at the longer 
infrared wavelengths emitted at its temperature rather than the sun's 
(low reflectance, high emittance). This would be the ideal cool roof 
material.

This roofing material probably exists.

Probably not.

Low emissivity is only accomplished painfully.

For example, black chrome on flat plate solar collectors is a plating process...that must be kept clean, or else the surface reverts to an emissivity of 0.8 - 0.9...of common materials....however, I'm not aware of it application to metal roofs.

Another example is where one makes minute record groves in the surface, but this too must be kept super clean...no dust...which is impossible for a roof. I never saw this applied to a solar collector.

Another material is minute ceramic beads embedded in epoxy...a special material used at the IAH airport...very durable...but very expensive...and still must be kept very, very clean.

One final example is Martin Black...a patented material made by the Martin Marietta company (the forerunner to Lockheed-Martin). This material also had to be kept clean.

Thanks for the replies,

I get it now. The "emittance" would take the form of infrared radiation,
which cannot pass through opaque objects. So like Alex said, the the roof
material would reject energy to the air but not "downwards" through the roof
lining.

What was really throwing me was reading that the most emissive material is
purely black, while the least is purely reflective (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity). So it seemed that if you went with
a high solar reflectance it would have to have low emissivity. But Dave, are
you saying that these properties can be split somewhere along the
electromagnetic spectrum? If a material reflects a certain wavelength, can
it not emit that wavelength?

We skipped over the section on radiation in Heat Transfer :(

Brad,

The emissivity and absorptivity of a passive material at any given
wavelength are equal, as stipulated by Kirchhoff over 100 years ago.
The only materials that violate this law are phase change materials
(which only violate it in a time average sense) or materials that have
some funky quantum mechanical mechanisms for heat removal.

Most common building materials have a similar absorpitivity (and
emissivity) for both short wavelengths (visible light i.e. solar
energy) and long wavelengths (infrared).  It is quite possible however
to design materials with a different absorptivity=emissivity for short
wavelengths and long wavelengths.  This is what makes a so-called
"cool" roof.

If you write a simple spreadsheet to compute the temperature on a roof
using an energy balance you can show that for a standard roof (i.e.
absorptivity=emissivity about the same at all wavelengths) the lowest
roof temperature and therefore lowest heat gain to the building will
be at a roof for a low absorptivity=low emissivity.

As important (or perhaps more important) in the overall roof design is
controlling the roof surface temperatures.  High temperatures mean
that the rooftop will undergo large temperature swings which means
large expansion/contraction and more thermal stress on the roof.  High
roof temperatures also mean locally high air temperatures which means
any rooftop condensers will have decreased efficiency.

A high absorptivity black roof can truly get hot enough to boil water
or fry eggs (210+ degrees F) on a hot summer day without wind
throughout much of the US.  An aluminum roof on the other hand might
get up to 160 F.

I've got an excel spreadsheet that I use in my building enclosure
design class that does the heat balance calculation and will show you
the heat transfer from solar insolation, long wavelength radiation
exchange to the sky, convection to the sky and conduction to the
interior.
Anyone who wants a copy can email me and I'll email it back to them.

Whoa, just a moment!  This discussion is starting to deteriorate into half
truths and inaccuracies.  First of all, most common (and inexpensive) paints
satisfy criteria of having high solar reflectance and high thermal
emissivity.  Ordinary white paint meets this criteria and for that reason is
very applicable for cool roofs.  The key here is that there are two major
bands of radiation, Solar (encompassing roughly UV, visible and near
infra-red wavelengths - from around 0.38 microns to 2.5 microns) and far
infra-red (also known as thermal) band (from about 2.5 microns to 50
microns).  Sun, with "surface" temperature of around 9300 F emits radiation
in, well Solar band, hence the name of the band.  Absorbed radiation in a
roof surface emits radiation energy in thermal band, because its temperature
is 100-200 F, which is much less than 9300 F.  Thus, surface properties need
to be evaluated at these two major bands.

Kirchoff's Law states that emissivity and absortivity of a surface is same
at the same wavelength, so if we slightly extrapolate this principle to the
entire band (not quite true but good enough for understanding the problem),
than one can say emissivity and absorptivity at solar band are equal and
emissivity and absorptivity at thermal band are equal.  While color of
paints affects solar absorptivity (thus white paint is reflective while
black paint is absorptive), all of these colors have same or nearly the same
emissivity at the thermal band (0.9).  This gives simple and inexpensive
solution to cool roof problem.  Paint the roof with white paint or other
light color, keep it relatively clean (because dirt will increase solar
absorptivity of the surface) and you got the cool roof.

Observation from several posters that high emissivity of the surface helps
in cooling climates is correct, meaning that high thermal emissivity of the
roof surface will help dissipate absorbed solar energy, since the
temperature to which roof is radiating in thermal band (sky, surrounding
objects) is quite a bit lower than the roof temperature.

Good Job, Charlie,

The distinction between Solar and Thermal Bands and the variation of the 
properties of the material along the wavelengths are the key to settle 
this aperient contradiction. 

Thank you, Charlie.

Re: [Bldg-sim] Why should roofs have high emissivity?








Whoa, just a moment!  This discussion is starting to deteriorate into half
truths and inaccuracies.  First of all, most common (and inexpensive) 
paints
satisfy criteria of having high solar reflectance and high thermal
emissivity.  Ordinary white paint meets this criteria and for that reason 
is
very applicable for cool roofs.  The key here is that there are two major
bands of radiation, Solar (encompassing roughly UV, visible and near
infra-red wavelengths - from around 0.38 microns to 2.5 microns) and far
infra-red (also known as thermal) band (from about 2.5 microns to 50
microns).  Sun, with "surface" temperature of around 9300 F emits 
radiation
in, well Solar band, hence the name of the band.  Absorbed radiation in a
roof surface emits radiation energy in thermal band, because its 
temperature
is 100-200 F, which is much less than 9300 F.  Thus, surface properties 
need
to be evaluated at these two major bands.

Kirchoff's Law states that emissivity and absortivity of a surface is same
at the same wavelength, so if we slightly extrapolate this principle to 
the
entire band (not quite true but good enough for understanding the 
problem),
than one can say emissivity and absorptivity at solar band are equal and
emissivity and absorptivity at thermal band are equal.  While color of
paints affects solar absorptivity (thus white paint is reflective while
black paint is absorptive), all of these colors have same or nearly the 
same
emissivity at the thermal band (0.9).  This gives simple and inexpensive
solution to cool roof problem.  Paint the roof with white paint or other
light color, keep it relatively clean (because dirt will increase solar
absorptivity of the surface) and you got the cool roof.

Observation from several posters that high emissivity of the surface helps
in cooling climates is correct, meaning that high thermal emissivity of 
the
roof surface will help dissipate absorbed solar energy, since the
temperature to which roof is radiating in thermal band (sky, surrounding
objects) is quite a bit lower than the roof temperature.

Brad,

The emissivity and absorptivity of a passive material at any given
wavelength are equal, as stipulated by Kirchhoff over 100 years ago.
The only materials that violate this law are phase change materials
(which only violate it in a time average sense) or materials that have
some funky quantum mechanical mechanisms for heat removal.

Most common building materials have a similar absorpitivity (and
emissivity) for both short wavelengths (visible light i.e. solar
energy) and long wavelengths (infrared).  It is quite possible however
to design materials with a different absorptivity=emissivity for short
wavelengths and long wavelengths.  This is what makes a so-called
"cool" roof.

If you write a simple spreadsheet to compute the temperature on a roof
using an energy balance you can show that for a standard roof (i.e.
absorptivity=emissivity about the same at all wavelengths) the lowest
roof temperature and therefore lowest heat gain to the building will
be at a roof for a low absorptivity=low emissivity.

As important (or perhaps more important) in the overall roof design is
controlling the roof surface temperatures.  High temperatures mean
that the rooftop will undergo large temperature swings which means
large expansion/contraction and more thermal stress on the roof.  High
roof temperatures also mean locally high air temperatures which means
any rooftop condensers will have decreased efficiency.

A high absorptivity black roof can truly get hot enough to boil water
or fry eggs (210+ degrees F) on a hot summer day without wind
throughout much of the US.  An aluminum roof on the other hand might
get up to 160 F.

I've got an excel spreadsheet that I use in my building enclosure
design class that does the heat balance calculation and will show you
the heat transfer from solar insolation, long wavelength radiation
exchange to the sky, convection to the sky and conduction to the
interior.
Anyone who wants a copy can email me and I'll email it back to them.

Brad -

Good discussion. To answer your last question:
Yes, a material that is a good reflector at a given wavelength will be a 
poor emitter at that wavelength. But the wavelength, or band of 
wavelengths, that a material emits at is inversely proportional to its 
temperature.  So if a material is a good reflector of solar radiation, 
i.e. visible light and near infrared, it will not need to emit radiation 
at these frequencies to stay cool because roofs do not get as hot as the 
sun. It will want to emit at a longer wavelengths, at which it may have 
a higher emissivity (and be a poor reflector). 

As per Charlie Curjica's comments, white paint is a good candidate 
because it reflects most of the visible radiation and has a high 
emittance at roof temperatures.  It would be a better cool roof material 
if it also reflected the solar near infrared - most of which it absorbs. 
The attached link is to an interesting study of the properties of roof 
materials. Essentially it says that for the materials tested, none was 
found that had a high reflectivity to both solar near infrared and 
visible energy, and if you have to choose, it's more important to 
reflect the visible spectrum than the near infrared.

Correction -

There a quite a few materials in that report that reflect both solar 
visible and infrared but there's none that have reflectance in the near 
infrared and low in the visible. I think that means they didn't find 
dark colors that could be very effective cool roofs.

Thanks for all of your thorough explanations. The issue is much clearer now.
I'll work my way through the resources and see if any other questions pop
up. Thanks again.

A key issue is the difference in values between the reflectance and the emissivity of a surface. For example, some white paint has higher emissivity than reflectance which makes it better than aluminum foil.

Yes, it makes sense.  High emissivity allows a roof to radiate its stored heat to the sky, thus aiding the cooling effect, so, yes, good for hot climates!

Note also that ASHRAE 90.1 gives credit for (i.e., relaxes) the U-Factor requirement for such roofs in climate zones 1, 2 and 3 (the warmest zones).  The ASHRAE Standard uses the term "High Albedo" for roofs with high reflectance AND high emissivity -- this is addressed in Section 5.5.3.1.1 and Table 5.5.3.1 in the 2007 version.

It seems to me that a roof that emits more radiation will have a greater warming effect on the building. Some houses in warm climates have radiant barriers because the aluminum has a low emissivity, thus blocking the infrared radiation. But both LEED and Energy Star suggest high emissivity for warm climates. Does this make sense?

This has been an interesting thread. What I am wondering is do you plan on getting a LEED point for a cool roof? If so and you are not going to use a "pre-approved" product how do you plan to show compliance with whatever emissivity or reflectance values are required? If pretty sure if you just painted your roof white you would need to show some test data per the correct procedures that your roof has the correct values. Anyone have experience with this?

The point related to decrease in reflectivity due to dust deposition (as
indicated by Charlie) is quite significant (especially in dusty areas,
places with high SPM in air, and having less rain) which may become one of
the major causes for deviation of the actual energy saving from simulation
results. One may have to exert little more while attempting to calibrate the
model with actual results if the dust is not cleaned periodically.

I was actually just writing an article but I wanted to know for any future
designs. It's my understanding that if the coating is opaque, the solar
reflectance and emittance only depend on the coating itself. The LEED
Reference Guide v. 2.2 lists coolroofs.org as a resource, which seems to
have a pretty comprehensive database of ratings (SR and emittance) for
field-applied paints/coatings. I'm not sure what to do if you can't find
data on your specific coating.
