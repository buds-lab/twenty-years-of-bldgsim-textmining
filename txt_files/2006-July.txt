Subject: [bldg-sim] Equest system sizing problem
In-Reply-To: <44C9085E.3070103@cdhenergy.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200607312118.AA1801234pd80001184999@gard.com>

I am sorry I think I didnt clearly explain what I am trying to do, I have a 
125000 sq ft building and I am keeping the architectural characteristics 
same but chaging the weather files between Minneapolis, Miami and St. Louis. 
I anticipated EQuest to report a higher capacity chiller for Miami and 
higher capacity boiler for Minneapolis as compared to other weather files 
but it is showing a flat trend. i can understand that the chiller size might 
not be effected a lot by three different climate zones but rather by solar 
angle (since it is a high glazed building) or other factors but Boiler size 
should have been reported more for minneapolis! any explanation would be 
helpful. please also note the energy consumptions are showing the right 
trend (more boiler energy consumption in Minneapolis and more chiller energy 
consumption in Miami).
Thanks,
Haider.

Kathryn,

You should try and go to Project & Site tab>right click on the project at
the top of the menu at the left hand side>go to properties>project data>file
references>and change the name of the weather file to the new location
weather file's name in the TMY2 folder ineQUEST folders. Then you'll be
prompted to change other site particulars like latitude, longitude and
altitude. That should work. I'm interested to see other's replies and find
out if there's other ways of doing it.

Hope this helps,
Ramana.

Hi,
Is there anyway to change the location for a detailed eQUEST model, but keep
all of my parametric runs?  The only way I know how to change the location
is by opening the .inp file for one of the runs b/c it prompts you with the
location.
Thanks!

Subject: [bldg-sim] eQUEST Dedicated Outdoor Air Systems with Zonal Fan-Coil/Heat Pumps
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200607280113.AA1350859pd80001181117@gard.com>

I'm working on modeling buildings with dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS) which supply OA to every zone and recieve the exhaust from every zone (with heat recovery).  Furthermore, each zone has its own fan-coil or air handler with its own heat pump.  The one-system-per-zone limitation seems like a major obstacle.  Right now I hava a VAV supplying some core zones and all other zones served by PTACs with heat pumps.  The PTAC-served zones draw their outside air from the central zones.
 
Troubles are:
 
1. I can't tell where the air from the PTAC zones exhausts to and I can't think of a way to ensure the benefit of the heat recovery in the DOAS.  I have not specified exhaust fans for the PTAC zones.
 
2. The DOAS is also supplied by a heat pump, so I define the CHW loops as the 2-pipe default and specify the heat source as "heat pump" but when I run the simulation, it won't get past calculating the loads and the output file says "caution: no heating/cooling equipment defined" at the bottm.
 
Is there a better (possible?) way to do this?  When I try to employ systems with zonal heating, none seem to have a heat-pump option at both the zone and system level.  I don't fully understand why I must specify a CHW loop for the VAV that I use to represent the DOAS when I want the cooling source to be a heat pump.
 
Any advice?  Sorry for all the questions, I would greatly appreciate any help.
 
Cheers,

Carrier has nearly finished assembling the required documentation
materials for the HAP program and will be submitting its 
certification application to DOE shortly.

Based on the apparent application processing times to date,
we estimate HAP could appear on the certification list
by early to mid-September.

Subject: [bldg-sim] DOE2.1E air source heat pump
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200607261347.AA4717500pd80001178972@gard.com>

Hello,
 
I am having trouble understanding the behaviour of an air source heat
pump in DOE2.1E and would appreciate any helpful insights. The system
has ample supplementary electric resistance heating capacity, but is
still unable to maintain heating sepoint conditions during cold spells
(typically starting just above the freezing mark) in the early morning
occupied periods (yes, there is a thermostat setback). I have created
hourly reports (all in SYSTEMS), which show:
 
1. System variable 78 (total heating capacity) is always large - in this
particular case, about 200,000 Btu/h
2. System variable 43 (adjusted capacity of heat pump in this hour)
changes moderately with changes in outdoor air dry bulb - about 40,000
Btu/h when OA temp=32F
3. System variable 166 (output of unit) is the same as variable 43
sometimes, typically when OA temp is about 36 or 37F - if OA temps are
lower, variable 166 values are much lower than variable 43 (down to
about 26,000 Btu/h)
4. System variable 5 (total central coil heating energy input) typically
matches variable 166 in more moderate OA temps, but greatly exceeds this
variable when OA temps are lower than about 38F (reaching a peak of
about 75,000 Btu/h)
5. Zone variable 48 (supplemental heat load for zone's heat pump this
hour) is always zero.
 
Some questions that come to mind:
 
1. Does the adjusted capacity of the heat pump (var. 43) not include the
effect of the defrost cycle? Is this why the output of the unit (var.
166) is lower?
2. What does variable 5 represent? Does it include supplemental electric
resistance heating? Defrost energy? (in this case, defrost type is
resistive, the default)
3. Can zone variable 48 be trusted? Is supplemental heat being
delivered? If not, why?
 
For completeness, some pertinent system inputs are shown below.
 
 MAX-SUPPLY-T          =  110
 HEAT-SOURCE           =  HEAT-PUMP
 HEATING-CAPACITY      =  -54589
 HEAT-SET-T            =  110
 HEATING-EIR           =  0.2762
 HP-SUPP-SOURCE        =  ELECTRIC
 HEAT-CAP-FT           =  SDL-C52
 HEAT-EIR-FT           =  SDL-C57
 HEAT-EIR-FPLR         =  SDL-C62
 MAX-HP-SUPP-T         =  40
 HP-SUPP-HT-CAP        =  -170650
 MIN-HP-T              =  23
 DEFROST-T             =  35

I have tried increasing the airflow, but the number of underheated hours
increased. Increasing supplemental capacity has no effect. My apologies
for the length of this email.

Armando,

In DOE-2/eQUEST you can specify them as fixed or movable interior shades and
define schedules for visible transmittance and solar heat gain through the
shade. I think ASHRAE fundamentals has some coefficients for when the blinds
are open and close.

Try the hotel companies such as Hilton and Marriott.
They should have Dual Duct systems, in their older
properties, unless they converted them to single duct
VAV.

Also try hospitals.

Can anybody give me an idea where I can find the numbers of commercial
buildings (grouped by the building usage type like hospitals, offices,
schools etc.) with a dual duct HVAC system in Southern California? I
need these numbers to use in a building simulation study which will
assess the total energy savings potential of a certain efficiency
measure on this type of buildings.

 

Thank you in advance for your help.

You can model daylighting through interior windows using
EnergyPlus/DesignBuilder provided you use the 'Full interior and exterior
solar' distribution method. This method has the requirement that all zones
are geometrically convex i.e. every surface in every zone can fully 'see'
every other surface in the zone.

I have personally never used eQUEST myself, but I know that Ramana Koti,
an MSc student from Arizona State University working with Marlin
Addison, recently carried out a comparison study of the DOE2.1 daylight
calculation engine and Daysim (Radiance-based) for which they imported
Daysim illuminance profiles directly into eQUEST. Ramana or Marlin can
probably share the details with you.

So, in case you have a 3-dimensional model of your building (e.g. in 3ds
or dxf) you can import it into Daysim and calculate the annual
illuminance profiles. You obviously have to use the same climate files
in both programs which should not be an issue since Daysim imports epw
files.

A work around using building shades etc just to calculate the daylight
levels would compromise the thermal calculations. Even if it can actually be
done, depending on the distance of the sensor from the actual external
window, I wouldn't count on the split-flux method to give you very accurate
daylight levels and hence energy savings.

Does anyone have a good idea how to model daylighting for core spaces - i.e. daylighting that has gone through interior windows or air-walls?

THANK YOU, STEVE.

But that is not documentation. Not everyone running
DOE-2 and the like does brain surgery on the files
them selves.

But I WILL look there. Can you use a Text Editor to
read them?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200607211258.AA5855421pd80001173017@gard.com>

Hello Everyone,

 

I am working on an eQUEST model that is giving me significant gas savings in
the winter, spring and fall and a gas penalty in the summer when I reduce
the lighting densities.  I don't know how these savings are being derived.
Can anyone offer insight?  Thanks.  Some model specifics are below.

 

The only thing different with the base and proposed input files are lighting
densities.

Using chilled water meter instead of a chilled water plant.

Using a linear boiler HIR curve with high turn down.

Outdoor air calculation method is Fraction of design.

Air side HVAC system is variable volume.

Amarpeet,

 

There is a chapter on Performance Curves in the "Volume 3 Topics"
documentation file.  This should have the information you are looking
for.  I think Volume 6 New Features has information on changes to the
chiller performance curves as well.

IS it 'LS-A' report which provides peak loads summary ?

Thank you,

I'm tyring to import one DOE2 file into another to make a campus of buildings in eQUEST.  The two buildings keep trying to reference the same schedules, polygons, etc. because they have the same names (eQUEST default names).  Is there any way to fix this without manually renaming every component in one of the buildings so they don't get confused?

Iwamoto, Shigeyuki Nagasaka, Yasuhiro Hamada,

Does anyone know more about this system and/or its installation in North

Ellen:

There have been some research/installation projects done in the US for snow melting systems that utilize ground as heat sources. The following report published by Federal Highway Administration provides detailed information about the snow melting systems for bridge decks that utilized various sources for heating, including geothermal energy in different ways. 

  Minsk, L.D. 1999. Heated Bridge Technology. Report on ISTEA Sec. 6005 Program. Report no.: FHWA-RD-99-158. July, 1999.
  http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/BRIDGE/hbrdeck.pdf

In some of these systems, ground source heat pumps are used to raise the fluid temperature further for better and faster snow melting performance. Depends on the design objective of the snow melting system (i.e. melt all the snow or just prevent bonding of ice), ground temperature, and thermal storage capability of the ground, it may or may not be sufficient to only use the underground thermal storage, which is similar to the vertical borehole field used for GSHP application, as the heat source. 

Oklahoma State University had also conducted some research related to the snow melting systems that utilizes geothermal energy. Numerical models for the hydronic snow melting system with different level of details have been developed. These models have been validated against measured data from lab test and/or real bridge snow melting system. These models have been added in the library of HVACSIM+. Combining the snow melting model with other component models, including vertical ground loop heat exchanger and circulation pump, simulation based studies have been conducted to investigate the impact of several design parameters on the snow melting performance. Following is the citations of a few papers resulting from the above work.

  Rees, S.J., J.D. Spitler and X. Xiao.  2002. Transient Analysis of Snow-melting System Performance. ASHRAE Transactions, 108(2): 406-423.

  Liu, X and J.D. Spitler. 2004. Simulation Based Investigation on the Design of Hydronic Snow Melting System. Transportation Research Board 83rd Annual Meeting, Washington, D.C., January 11-15, 2004.

I was extensively involved in the snow melting research project at OSU. I will be happy to discuss with you more about this topic.

Andrew,

You can get simulation inputs for different building
types tied to a version of 90.1 -- you'd have to put
in the size -- from the EnergyPlus web interface.
Go to the bottom center of this page (E+ example file generator):
http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/interfaces_tools.html

DOE is creating prototypes based on the 2003 CBECS
(Joe Huang is updating work he did based on 1995 CBECS).
We hope to make those available for use late this summer or early fall.
(We will announce their availability on the various email lists.)

I am wondering if anyone is aware of standard/generic prepared building
models that can be used for retrofit evaluations.  I am working on a
project where we are testing various new ventilation technologies in
several climate zones.  The technologies are to be evaluated in several
generic buildings ? a hotel, school, hospital and office building ? to see
what the affect of the different climates is on the technologies.  Has
anyone constructed hypothetical models that fall into these categories?

Thanks,

Andrew

Ian,

Victorville is climatically much more similar to Barstow than Riverside.
Victorville's about 1,000 ft higher in elevation than Barstow though.  

You might want to check out Air Force climatic data also, Edwards AFB
would be pretty similar to Victorville, but I'd be willing to bet
Victorville/Barstow/Edwards AFB are all very similar.

Paul,

You are correct, that the chiller is supposed to be water cooled, and I
also agree that it could be stated more clearly. At the recent ASHRAE
90.1 meeting there was language introduced to clarify this to
specifically state "water-cooled" in the chiller description table. This
should show up in the 90.1, 2007 version of Appendix G.

Table G3.1.1.A of 90.1-2004 uses building type & size to specify base
system parameters including CAV or VAV and direct expansion or chilled
water cooling.  So I would first confirm if your base building will
have
a chiller before addressing chiller type. 

As for chiller type, I have not found it is explicitly stated or
mapped
so I have been interpreting the Heat Rejection Requirement in
G3.1.3.11
to mean that whenever Table G3.1.1.A requires a base with chilled
water
cooling that the base is a water cooled chiller with an axial vane
cooling tower.  I welcome any  corrections or other interpretations.

Also I learned from Bldg-Sim responses this week, ASHRAE has revised
Table G3.1.1.A in an addendum but I am not if the USGBC/LEED
acknowledge
addendums or if those would have to be submitted as CIR's.

For my project, I was using LEED 2.1 guidelines. However, because of
the
changes to LEED from 2.1 to 2.2 you may need to submit a 2.2 CIR
giving
reference to the 2.1 CIR as part of your rationale.

Mitch/Wade and Team,

Is it also true for LEED 2.2 (PRM method app. G 90.1 2004) I cannot
find
a reference to 150 Ton exception in LEED 2.2 manual. 

Searched for CIRs on LEED 2.2 regarding the 150 Ton allowance but
there
were none. However, did find the CIR on LEED 2.1 regarding the 150 Ton
allowance for 'air-cooled'. It is also mentioned under LEED 2.1 EMP
(energy modeling protocol). 

So how does it apply to LEED 2.2 or it doesn't.

Thanks,

Wade,

I had a similar question submitted to the USGBC and it was deemed a
water-cooled system. However, if the capacity is less than 150 tons,
there was a CIR allowing the use of an air-cooled systems.

This may have been covered in a previous thread, but I'm away from my
email archive at the moment.

Regarding LEED modeling with respect to the ASHRAE ECB/DEC method:
Does
anyone have a sense of whether an evaporatively-cooled chiller is
considered air- or water-cooled?   It makes a considerable difference
to
the modeling of the ECB (base case), and thus to the evaluated
savings.

Thanks,

Appendix G in 90.1, 2004 sets the baseline system type based on the size
and program of the building. If the building is less than 150,000 sqft,
the cooling type is direct expansion, either as part of a packaged VAV
system or a packaged single zone system. If the building is > 150,000
sqft, the cooling type is chilled water, and the heat rejection devise
is a cooling tower. In almost all cases if your proposed design has a
peak cooling load of 150 tons or less, it will be to serve a building
less than 150,000 sqft, and your baseline system will be direct
expansion cooling.

Wade,

I had a similar question submitted to the USGBC and it was deemed a
water-cooled system. However, if the capacity is less than 150 tons,
there was a CIR allowing the use of an air-cooled systems.

This may have been covered in a previous thread, but I'm away from my
email archive at the moment.

Regarding LEED modeling with respect to the ASHRAE ECB/DEC method:
Does
anyone have a sense of whether an evaporatively-cooled chiller is
considered air- or water-cooled?   It makes a considerable difference
to
the modeling of the ECB (base case), and thus to the evaluated
savings.

Thanks,

Table G3.1.1.A of 90.1-2004 uses building type & size to specify base
system parameters including CAV or VAV and direct expansion or chilled
water cooling.  So I would first confirm if your base building will have
a chiller before addressing chiller type. 

As for chiller type, I have not found it is explicitly stated or mapped
so I have been interpreting the Heat Rejection Requirement in G3.1.3.11
to mean that whenever Table G3.1.1.A requires a base with chilled water
cooling that the base is a water cooled chiller with an axial vane
cooling tower.  I welcome any  corrections or other interpretations.

Also I learned from Bldg-Sim responses this week, ASHRAE has revised
Table G3.1.1.A in an addendum but I am not if the USGBC/LEED acknowledge
addendums or if those would have to be submitted as CIR's.

For my project, I was using LEED 2.1 guidelines. However, because of the
changes to LEED from 2.1 to 2.2 you may need to submit a 2.2 CIR giving
reference to the 2.1 CIR as part of your rationale.

Mitch/Wade and Team,

Is it also true for LEED 2.2 (PRM method app. G 90.1 2004) I cannot find
a reference to 150 Ton exception in LEED 2.2 manual. 

Searched for CIRs on LEED 2.2 regarding the 150 Ton allowance but there
were none. However, did find the CIR on LEED 2.1 regarding the 150 Ton
allowance for 'air-cooled'. It is also mentioned under LEED 2.1 EMP
(energy modeling protocol). 

So how does it apply to LEED 2.2 or it doesn't.

This paper is part of a research project aiming to model the impact of
air leakage on pressure regimes, resultant air movement and energy use
in high-rise residential buildings using an advanced energy and airflow
simulation tool: ESP-r. Simplified simulations for small sections of the
building for which experimental data are available are carried out
first. Results are also presented for the second stage of the research -
transient whole building simulation.

DesignBuilder provides an easy-to-use interface to the EnergyPlus Airnet
multizone airflow simulation capability. Set the Ventilation building model
option to 'Calculated' to activate Airnet simulations. This allows you to
account for the effect of window opening, cracks in the fabric, buoyancy
driven airflow, wind pressure on each surface etc in your calculations.

Krishna,

You have to be careful in distinguishing Hourly-Reports for LOADS versus SYSTEMS or PLANT. From your description, you seem to be extracting the GLOBAL variables in SYSTEMS, where variable 6 is the current hour of simulation, and 8 is the dry bulb temperature (see DOE-2.1E Supplement, p. A.16). Ground-temperatures in Rankine are available as GLOBAL variable 2 in the LOADS hourly-report (see DOE-2.1E Supplement, p. A.2).

Therefore, you should try moving your HOURLY-REPORT commands from SYSTEMS to LOADS.

  Hi
        I am trying to get the ground temperatures from Doe2.1e. The the Doe2 manual on "Libraries and reports" states that the ground temperature is GLOBAL variable with a variable list number 2. From some examples I have noticed that the we need to add 4 to the stated list number for GLOBAL outputs.
        When I specify 8 as the Variable list I get the expected dry bulb temperature as the output. I am assuming that I should specify 6 for the ground temperatures.   However I get the current hour as the output instead. Please let me know how I could get the ground temperatures.

  Also I am trying to output the BUILDING-LOADS variable list no 10 (building lighting heating loads). When I specify the Variable-Type = BUILDING or even BUILDING-LOADS. I get an error "symbol previously undefined". Please let me know what is to be specified as the VARIABLE-TYPE to get the building loads.
  thanks,
  Krishna

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200607111342.AA4233281pd80001161800@gard.com>

Hi
      I am trying to get the ground temperatures from Doe2.1e. The the Doe2 manual on "Libraries and reports" states that the ground temperature is GLOBAL variable with a variable list number 2. From some examples I have noticed that the we need to add 4 to the stated list number for GLOBAL outputs.
      When I specify 8 as the Variable list I get the expected dry bulb temperature as the output. I am assuming that I should specify 6 for the ground temperatures.   However I get the current hour as the output instead. Please let me know how I could get the ground temperatures.

Also I am trying to output the BUILDING-LOADS variable list no 10 (building lighting heating loads). When I specify the Variable-Type = BUILDING or even BUILDING-LOADS. I get an error "symbol previously undefined". Please let me know what is to be specified as the VARIABLE-TYPE to get the building loads.
thanks,
Krishna

Dear IBPSA Members and Friends

In order to allow the awardees time to plan to attend, it is time to
consider nominations for the up-coming 2007 conference in Beijing, China.
We would now invite nominations in the usual three categories as listed
below and for each category we will require a brief CV or summary of work
(relating to the appropriate category) for the nominee(s) plus the
additional information outlined for each category below (Distinguished
Service Award, Young Contributor Award, and Outstanding Practice).

Nominations should be sent in the first instance to Lori McElroy as
representative of the Awards Committee ? lori.mcelroy at thelighthouse.co.uk by
a closing date of the 31st August 2006.

We hope that there will be a good competition this time, so please contact
me to discuss a possible nomination if required.  We also hope that
nominations will be made for the Distinguished Practice Award this time
around, as no award was made in this category last time, despite the fact
that there is plenty of appropriate talent Worldwide.

Kind regards

Lori McElroy

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200607101235.AA3511218pd80001160542@gard.com>

I jumped the gun on the second email on Friday, and just want to correct
the error...
 
The Electric Misc Equip discrepancy was also a result of the Process
Load that caused the problems on the Natural Gas.  
 
The take-away is that if you assign a process load to your HW
circulation loops, the energy will show up under the end use of "Misc
Equip" in your BEPS/BEPU reports - NOT under "Space Heating."   The
electric add to the "Misc Equip" category is from the EIR associated
with the process load (that is, if you set the EIR to zero, then there
is no change in electric energy use under "Misc Equip").  If you do not
have a process load assigned, the energy use related to the EIR on the
boilers is directed fully to "Space heating" end use category.

for those interested - I figured out the sources of the discrepancies
 
Electric - Misc Equip discrepancy
Under the HW Boilers w/ Draft, there is an EIR that can be to model the
induced draft fans on the natural gas boiler.  When I set this EIR equal
to 0 in both the "Design" and "Budget" case models, the electric KWH
under "Misc Equip" in the BEPS/BEPU is the same.  I expected that the
boiler induced draft fan energy would be listed under the "Heating" end
use (or under "Fans" as a second choice)...  so Heads Up that it goes to
"Misc Equip"
 
Nat'l Gas - Misc Equip discrepancy
The natural gas Misc Equip "mystery" was my OOPS....  there was a
process load assigned to both models on the Secondary HW loop (I forgot
to look there - only checking the primary HW loop), and although both
the load and schedule were the same for the process load between models
(thus not showing up in my .inp file comparison), the different energy
end use probably resulted from hitting different parts of the boiler
part-load curve.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] doe2 "Misc Equip" reporting errors?


I'm getting some strange output reporting in my doe2 SIM file under
energy end uses in BEPS and BEPU simulation file reports for the end use
"Misc Equipment."  It seems that some of my space heating and cooling
energy use is being directed to the "Misc Equip" end use category in the
simulation file....
 
Has anyone experienced something similar?  Anyone know why this might be
occurring and how to correct this?
 
more detail below.....
 
I'm using eQuest v3.55, and am doing an ASHRAE 90.1-1999 ECB method
energy study, so I have a "Design" case model of the building according
to construction documents, and have backed out a "Budget" case model
following the ECB guidelines in 90.1 (and associated HVAC system map
changes).
 
CASE 1
All Equipment plug loads assigned to spaces are assigned as electric
loads, and are identical between by "Design" case model and my "Budget"
case model.  No other internal energy sources are defined in either
model.  All schedules are identical between models.  No process loads
are assigned to any of my circulation loops or plant equipment.
The differences between input files are limited to:  lighting power
densities, construction types (walls, roof, glass, etc), and HVAC system
types are different due to following the ECB modeling methodology.
In my SIM file under "Misc Equip" in the BEPS/BEPU reports, I have very
different electrical KWH used under "Misc Equip", and Natural gas uses
have appeared in this same "Misc Equip" category, again with very
different total Therms used.... 
Does anyone know why the electric use under "Misc Equip" could be
different between the two models, and how natural gas use might have
appeared in the "Misc Equip" end use category
 
CASE 2
I tried reworking the input file a bit to make the "Design" and "Budget"
cases match in all of the HVAC equipment (i.e. including all HVAC
systems and thermal zones, and HVAC circ loops and plant equipment are
now identical).  So, for this run, the only differences between the two
input files are in Lighting loads, and Construction types.  
In this run, the BEPS/BEPU reports for the two models "Misc Equip" end
use category are still different between the two models for both
electric KWH used, and natural gas Therms, but the difference between
the models is much smaller than in "Case 1" above where the HVAC system
types were different.....   
 
Please let me know if you have any advice on how to correct this...

Thank you,
Kate

You are correct. These sections are contradictory. Addendum A to 90.1, 2004 was approved a while back to fix this issue as well as several others. A compilation of approved addenda to 90.1, 2004 is  published  on the ASHRAE website. Here is the link.
http://www.ashrae.org/content/ASHRAE/ASHRAE/ArticleAltFormat/200661121930_347.pdf

 The modified language is as follows:

G4.2.3.12  Supply Air Temperature Reset (Systems 5 through 8). The air temperature for cooling shall be reset higher by 5?F (2.3?C) under the minimum cooling load conditions.

The section numbering has also been changed. Hope that helps.

I would appreciate any clarifications that can be shared on the underlined sentences in these two excerpts from Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2004.  They seem contradictory so I must be missing the author's intent.
G3.1.2.8 Design Air Flow Rates. System design supply air flow rates for the baseline building design shall be based on a supply-air-to-room-air temperature difference of 20?F. If return or relief fans are specified in the proposed design, the baseline building design shall also be modeled with fans serving the same functions and sized for the baseline system supply fan air quantity less the minimum outdoor air, or 90% of the supply fan air quantity, whichever is larger.

G3.1.3.12 Supply Air Temperature Reset (Systems 5 through 8). Supply air temperature shall be reset based on zone demand from the design temperature difference to a 10?F temperature difference under minimum load conditions.

The following is strikethrough:

Supply air temperature shall be reset based on

zone demand from the design temperature difference to a

10?F (5.6?C) temperature difference under minimum load

conditions. Design air flow rates shall be sized for the reset

supply air temperature; i.e., a 10?F (5.6?C) temperature difference.

Hi Kathleen,

obviously hourly data for Bangkok can be found here:
http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data3.cfm/region=2_asia_wmo_region_2/country=THA/cname=Thailand
Dew point and wet bulb temp should be included.

Best regards
Mat

Hi,

 

I am looking for a place to get the dew point temperatures for Bangkok.  I
cannot get Bangkok data or a site close enough from NCDC.  If anyone has any
suggestions that would be great.

I have never found a way to do it directly, so what I have done in the past 
is to create a PIU system with a dummy chilled water system to simulate the 
DX cooling.  You have to remember to change the chiller performance curves 
to DX curves, and set the CHW pump head to 0 so there will be no pump 
energy.

Sir:

Dumb question.

How can you use eQUEST when it hasn't been approved
for Title-24 compliance for the existing 2005 code?

Hi,

I am using eQuest for Title 24 compliance analysis.

When the simulation is sizing the proposed HVAC the simulation ends and
prompts that the compliance analysis could not be completed due to error.

The error message is as below:

Rules Evaluation Error List
Message: Division by zero evaluating rule: Calc ratio of dsn clg system size
to proposed size (2.4.2.25.3)


What does this error mean and where do I look to find a possible solution?

I would greatly appreciate any feedback. Thanks.



Best regards,

Gaurav Mehta

I think you're right.  The problem with that is that it provides no
incentive with respect to EAcr1 to go with a more efficient
evaporatively-cooled chiller if you've already decided not to pursue a
fully water-cooled option (due to first-cost constraints, space
limitations, etc.).

Would this be arguable in a CIR?

Wade

Wade,

I had a similar question submitted to the USGBC and it was deemed a water-cooled system. However, if the capacity is less than 150 tons, there was a CIR allowing the use of an air-cooled systems.

This may have been covered in a previous thread, but I'm away from my email archive at the moment.

Regarding LEED modeling with respect to the ASHRAE ECB/DEC method: Does anyone have a sense of whether an evaporatively-cooled chiller is considered air- or water-cooled?   It makes a considerable difference to the modeling of the ECB (base case), and thus to the evaluated savings.

Hi,
I am looking for a clarification on eQuest report.
When I look at SS-D report and find the Size of system
in tons (maximum cooling load/12000 Btu/hr), it comes
out to be much different than the Summary report at
Air Side HVAC system. I can only think of safety
factor but the difference is almost 100% (in my case
570 tons in summary  vs 298 tons in SS-D). The results
are different if I look at peak demand results (3.5
kW/ton) in summary view. Why is this difference and
which one value should I consider for cooling system
size in tons? I appreciate any explaination and help.

thanks


Leela

Check the SS-R reports to pinpoint the system / zone of concern.  Could be a number of control or sizing issues leading to this result.  Note that hours outside throttling range during optimum start and night ventilative cooling periods get reported within these hours so if you have a lot of nighttime ventilative cooling hours everything may in fact be alright ...

  I was trying to model a VAVS system using DOE-2.1e.
  However, I am unable to get rid the fact that:
  PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE =  5.0
  Can anybody give me pointers to what I should be looking at in order to eliminate this inadequacy in results.
  Your help is greatly appreciated.
  Thanks
  Jaya Mukhopadhyay

You also need to account for the frame width which gets equally distributed around the window and beyond the window dimensions.

  Ramana,
  Check your window sizes - yyou probably have a larger  (or equal) window area than your wall area.
