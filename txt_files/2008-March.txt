Subject: [Bldg-sim] unmet load hours of VAV+baseboard system
Message-ID: <66f63cae0803020905l41807a5eu57c8b52855cf460b@mail.gmail.com>

Dear folks,

I am simulating an office building to be LEED-certified.

The system for the proposed design is VAV+baseboard radiation. The system
contains no reheating and preheating.

The system for the baseline is VAV with reheat, but without preheat.

The unmet load hours for both models are significant and sim file outputs
warnings as below:

"Warning message"

 **WARNING**********************************************************************
             PREHEAT/HEATING-CAPACITY in SYSTEM E1 Sys1
(VAVS)
             is too low to provide the requested supply temperature for
             the calculated mixed air temperature using total ZONE loads
             (on LS-A/B) and SYSTEM design parameters, plus outside air
             conditions (on LS-C), and specified capacities & air flows.
             Requested temperature is  52.00 calculated is  48.87
             Check HEATING-CAPACITY, HEAT-SET-T, PRE-HEAT-T, MAX-SUPPLY-T,
             DESIGN-HEAT-T, and ZONE loads for consistency.


I am wondering if any expert could tell me what accounts for warnings and
the high unmet load hours, and how to reduce it.

Thank you

Jessi Xu

Dear all,

I am modeling an exterior lighitng arrangement using DIALux. As per LEED SS Cr8, there is an upper limit on horizontal and verticle footcandles on site boundary as well as x feet beyond the boundary.

I need to create a calculation grid to measure site illumination at ground plane ,verticle calculation grid at site boundary and at the extents of light zone requirement. 
Normal calculation surface way is not help full in creating a verticle grid at property boundary.

Does anyone know how to simulate it in DIALux?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Equest Cooling Desing Day
Message-ID: <C3F17FC3.7EE%steve@thespinnakergroupinc.com>

I?m hoping someone can help me figure out how to get eQuest to perform a
unit sizing according to a user-defined cooling design day as opposed to the
hourly weather data.

Situation: I?m modeling a four-story residential building in West Palm
Beach, FL where each apartment uses a split system.  I?m getting an odd
situation where eQuest tells me the peak cooling load is being set in
January, and while I haven?t 100% figured that one out, I suspect if I tell
the program to size the unit based on a cooling design day derived from
ASHRAE data then that issue will go away.

Problem: I can?t figure out how to define the outside air conditions for the
cooling design day.

I know there was a recent discussion on using eQuest to do equipment sizing,
but I can? find that discussion on the archives.  Here?s what I have figured
out:
* If you?re modeling a location outside California, you have to manually
input temperatures and humidity for the design day.  These are going to be
worse than probably anything in the weather data file because they?re
extremes (the ASHRAE 97.5% or similar).
* eQuest lets you define ?CDD? schedules where you can specify percentages
for occupancy, lighting, misc equipment, etc.  I know how to do this.

So where do I go in eQuest to define my cooling design day exterior
conditions?  Is it in the Wizard?  Do I do it via Detailed Data interface?
Do I have to go all the way out to the BDL file, alter it in a text editor,
and then run DOE2 separately from eQuest?  (I haven?t figured out how to
make changes to a BDL and run it in eQuest without eQuest overwriting any of
my changes.)

Help.  Please.

Dear folks,

I am simulating a LEED-certified building. Purchased steam is provided to
the proposed design. Baseboard radiation using hot water that is exchanged
from purchased steam is used to heat the zone. In Equest, the zone heat
source is defined as STEAM. Chillers are of absorption-type  connected to a
hot water loop, which is actually a steam loop.

After the simulation, my problem is that energy use for the space heating is
zero in the sim file. Please advise what is the proper setting for such a
baseboard system in Equest.

Please also advise what is the proper practice to set purchased steam.
Thanks in advance.

I only know of creating design days in the Detailed Edit mode, but it's
not hard.  Click on the Project and Site tab to bring up its window pane
and then right click on the top line that says "Project: ...(whatever
your project name is)".  One of the options is "Create Design Day..."
and you can specify whether it's heating or cooling.  

 

Good luck.

Hello Modelers.
 
I am looking for information/experience with applying the ASHRAE
90.1-2004 , Appendix G for labs. 
 
It is well known that  Appendix G cannot be used properly for labs. The
ECB and Labs 21 fixed many of the problems and now they are part of the
2007 version ( not as addenda to the 2004 version). USGBC refers to the
2004 version , but also allows the use of 2004 addenda (per USGBC memo
from April 26 2007). I am wondering if anybody knows what is the
position of USGBC regarding the 2007 appendix G changes. 
 
Thanks

Message-ID: <93D3BFB11717E6438EF8FD2BA87D32701FE53A@UUSNWEI3.global.utcmail.com>

Hi,

I am now using a Loop-Loop heat pump and a normal chiller working
together to supply heating and cooling for a workshop. The Lake/Well
loop is used as condenser water for both L-L heat pump and chiller. 

There are two influential design temperature in Lake/Well panel - Design
CHW Temp and Design HW Temp. According to the help file, the values
represent the design temperature used for components that draw/reject
heat from/to the loop. So I guess the Design HW Temp should be the
evaporating temperature for L-L heat pump in winter. 

Because I use geothermal as heat source and the ground loop temperature
is around 60F, I set the Design HW Temp lower than 60F. However, eQuest
crashed. It seems that the eQuest can only run when the Design HW Temp
is higher than 60F and lower than 101F. I don't understand why this
happens and feel confused about the meaning of this Temperature. 

Anyone who has similar experience could give me some help? Thank you a
lot!!

Best,
Joy

my question is what exact meaning of the name in red cycle in attached.

Hello,

I have a building in my energy model that the roof is sloped one way and
e-quest only allows you to slope a roof either two ways or four ways.
Does anyone know how to fully construct a one way sloping roof using
e-quest?  Thanks.

Greetings-
I believe in DD you can select a roof pitch that will tilt in a single plane.  

Using either the menue on the left side of the screen, or using the mouse in 3-D view, select the roof.  Right click for properties, and input the Tilt.  I do not know how eQeust selects with edge to use as a plane of rotation.  

You can also input the tilt angle on the spreadsheet.

Good luck.

You'll need to calculate (and provide the documentation) for a
calculated $/unit based on the energy prices and equipment efficiencies
for the project.

 

Some of the table prices per unit look a little dated.  Steam and CHW
unit prices could vary quite a bit depending on your energy cost and
equipment efficiencies.  Not that your values can't be these values for
steam and CHW, but you'll have to show how you calculated them.  Don't
forget to include the CUP pumping and heat rejection contributions when
providing a purchased CHW rate.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Ice Rinks and Ice Rink chillers
Message-ID: <b9ccef090803041123s3564aa62y846669c1033debc7@mail.gmail.com>

A few Questions:

1. I am modeling an ice arena with one ice rink in the main zone. I know
that the ice skating keywords available to DOE-2 cannot be utilized through
eQuest, but I included them in the input file anyhow to effectively model
the ice rink "behind the scenes". This has worked thus far: the SIM report
includes an annual load report for the ice rink (RS-I) and the CHW loop
reflects this load. However, the attached chiller does not appear to see
this load and thus does not use any energy to meet it.

Has anyone tried this before and have any advice? I will assume that raw
DOE-2 would work and that trying this behind eQuest is the problem, but I
just want to try anyhow.

2. Does anyone know of a source for Chiller performance curves for a chiller
capable of handling ice rink conditions? The loop temp is ~ 21 F and I have
not ben able to locate any performace curve data for this type of chiller
yet.

3. I have tried to extract the DOE-2 zip file from the website to my C:\ but
I get prompts demanding passwords (password protected files) for all of the
included files. I have looked at the Installation and Execution instructions
and I think I'm following them correctly, so am I missing something?

Thanks,
Tim

in answer to the 1st question, add : 

BRINE-LOOP       = "Brine loop"

to the rink zone.  The "Brine loop" is the CHW loop the chiller is on -- 
this should add the rink load to your chiller.  Hope this helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DHW heater efficiency calculations for baseline
Message-ID: <1204666917.47cdc22515daa@webmail.vt.edu>

The DHW heater efficiency calculations for baseline are based on Table 7.8. For
Gas storage water heaters, the size >75,000 btu/h, and <4000 (Btu/h)/gal, the
baseline performance is:

80% Et(Q/800+110V^1/2) SL, Btu/h = 80%*(400000/800+100*130^1/2).
The input Q for the heater is 400,000 Btu/h, and V is 130 gal. So the SL
calculated is 3077 Btu/h.

Since the SL is defined as standby loss based on 70F temperature difference
between stored water and ambient requirements, is it right to calculate the
efficiency by Q-SL/Q? The result is 99.6%, which appears to be so high!

Could anyone show me if it is right or the right calculation for this?

Thanks in advance!

Ying

Message-ID: <278D42BD376F4C46A2CAE5B7383C7C612FB237@jdrsrv01.jdr.local>

Hi All,

 

I am having difficulty with some modified weather data.  I've taken the
".bin" weather file, converted it to a text file (with the DOE2 weather
utilities programs), made some dry bulb temperature modifications,
converted it back to a ".bin" file (with the same utilities programs).
Everything seems to check out...there are no known problems with the
conversion, and the original and modified ".bin" files are the same size
(146 kb).  I have dropped the new weather file into the eQUEST weather
folder and changed the reference in my eQUEST file (Project Data, File
References, Weather File) to the newly created weather file.  When I
attempt to perform a simulation, the program stops (freezes) before
getting thru any of the simulation.

 

Any help/ideas are appreciated.

 

Thanks!

Bryan---

In the "Project and Site" tab, there is a section for Hourly Reports in the window pane.  Right click on the "Hourly Report Block" folder and choose to create an hourly report block.  Name it "Zone temperature data" or something like that.  In the scroll down menu for "variable type", select the thermal zone you are interested in.  They should be towards the bottom of the list.  Then in the "variable list", check the box that says "Current hour zone temp (deg F)"  To finish, you need to open the hourly report navigation window and make sure that the block you just created is attached to the default hourly report that is created with every project.  

Now simulate the building.  Depending on what version of eQUEST you have, you can either export the hourly results from the .sim file, or export them by selecting "Export hourly results..." from the File drop down menu.

Good luck.

Andrew

Message-ID: <009301c87e7f$8913c620$0600000a@athlonx2>

I spent several years with DOE-2 modeling in the early 1990s, but I am rusty
and I am a new eQUEST user, so I have what should be a basic question:

I was checking the reasonableness of an eQUEST run by comparing the annual
end-use data with data from the California End-Use Survey--CEUS.  

In doing so, I learned that the Vent Fans end-use kWh in eQUEST appears to
only include the kWh associated with providing outside air ventilation, not
the total fan kWh.  I checked Report SV-A, the annual reports, and the
hourly reports, and compared them to what I would calculate for fan energy
based on the input CFM and a reasonable pressure rise, and this seems pretty
clear.  However, this inference seems to contradict the documentation, so I
am not sure.

What is included in the VENT / VENT FANS end-use, and what is included in
the COOL end-use?

FWIW, the systems are packaged VAV.

Thanks,

Bill

Hi Linda,

Funny you ask, I am currently experimenting with modeling UFAD systems in
eQuest (and would appreciate feedback on my methods from the bldg sim
group).

The application I'm working on is for core zones only, so the loads are
people, lighting, equipment (cooling loads) and outdoor air ventilation.

A few notes on UFAD systems in general:

Supply air for UFAD (under floor air distribution systems) is supplied
through diffusers in floor panels.  Correct design results in stratification
(see http://www.hpac.com/Issue/Article/38686/38686#f1 for explanation).

Cooling supply air temperature is usually around 63-65 F

The thermostat is usually located at 48"

In cooling mode, air is supplied low at a relatively high temperature and
returned high at a higher temperature, this allows a greater dT across the
cooling coil.

In order to model this system, the stratification of the space and higher
return air temperatures must be taken into account.  To achieve this, I
split each room into an upper and lower section at about 5'.  The upper
space is designated as a return air plenum and contains all lighting loads
(except for task lighting loads).  The lower section contains the people
loads and the equipment loads.  Any exterior windows or doors should be
distributed across the elevation of both spaces representing actual building
design.  The upper and lower sections are split with a horizontal partition
of type "air barrier."  I then run the model to determine the difference in
space temperature between upper and lower room sections, during hours when
the building is conditioned (fan "on" hours).  I look for a difference of
about 2 degrees F for times when the space is in cooling mode.  For the
systems I have tried, I usually end up the yearly average for "fan-on" hours
to be about 1 degree F.  This number can be changed by adjusting the U-value
of the partition, and adjusting the internal loads (within reason), if
necessary.

I set the thermostat for the space to be 1 degree cooler than the baseline
case.

Supply air temperature is 63-65 degrees, depending on design.  The supply
fan may also have a lower pressure drop than the base case.

I have modeled the system as Packaged Multizone with heating locked out
above 65 degrees, and cooling locked out below 65 degrees to simulate bypass
(this method is documented in the DOE2.2 help file).

So far with this method, I have come up with energy savings of 15-20% for
both cooling and fan energy, which is consistent with the range given by
UFAD documentation.

If anyone has information regarding UFAD systems and heating energy use, I'm
interested.

~karen~

Message-ID: <F94102E3F5278A41AE61586593CB484402601193@sv04005.rmf.com>

Hello All,

I have finally figured out how to make a one-sided sloped roof by making
polygons.  Now that I am finished with that part I am trying to simulate
the building's design performance but a "bad building component message"
pops up on the screen.  The way that I constructed the roof was I took
the dimensions of the used to be flat roof and used those to make a
rectangular polygon and tilted it.  After that it left openings on both
sides near the top b/c it's going from being flat to slope so I made
triangular polygons on both sides to fill in the space.  Also the
building was divided up into two zones with a partition wall separating
the two and it went up to the roof/ceiling, so could that be the problem
and if that is so then how to I construct a ceiling in the detailed edit
wizard screen?

Thanks.

Bryan,

 

The DOE2.com website has some Weather Data Processing Utility programs that you can download to modify TMY2 files.  The programs are DOS based, but the bin files can be converted and then read in an excel spreadsheet (and then converted back).

 

I?m having a bit of trouble with some of my conversions, but am trying to work thru the process.

- In the 'Compilance Analysis options' screen from eQuest, there is a 
check box named 'Write LEED energy summary report', but it is not 
activated. ?how can this capability be used?

- The eQuest 3.60 and 3.61 seem to como without any documentation (when 
installiong the EXE files available in the web). Is there a place where  
complete documentqation on eQuest is available?


Looking forward to hear from you,

Tim,

I don't think eQuest has an option for a boiler stack economizer.

I had one on a past energy model.  I increased the efficiency of the boiler based on the heat I was recovering from the economizer.

Hope this helps.

I think Mark is right. That is the way I always did ii in DOE-2.1E, and
I am unaware of any enhancements to 2.2 (eQuest engine).

Xavier:

You need 3.61B or later to get the on line
documentation. Current "stable" version is 3.61e.

Of course, California T-24 only recognizes 3.60
currently. Politics.

The Compliance area is only for California Title-24.
As far as I know, THAT LEED is a railway spur in need
of future expansion.

LEED means different things to different Codes. There
is hope that an ASHRAE 90.1 RuleSet will be developed
soon. But the Codes seem to change faster than the
eQuest code writers can accept them.

Don't expect everything to be "cookbook" in these
progrmas. You STILL need to:

1) Make sure a particular analysis makes common sense.

2) Confirm EVERY Base vs. Proposed input, and not
accept eQuest automatic inputs.

Hello All,

Every time that I try to run a simulation of my building using e-quest an error message pops up that says "errors during hvac simulation or design calculations.  See sim file for details."  I went under the simulation file and found the error and it was for one of my air handling units, and it said that "cooling coil leaving temperature must be at least 6?F higher than entering water temp."  I've been looking all over in the different files and pretty much my question is where do I go in order to change this to be correct?  Another question is every time that I go to make a custom roof in the detailed edit wizard and go back to the building creation wizard the custom roof changes back to the previous shape and I was wondering why that was.  

Thanks.

Hi Christofer,
About the cooling coil error, try reducing mass flow in this water circuit.
About loosing information you change in the detailed interface once you 
go back to the wizards, eQuest is just like this. Make sure you have 
done everyting you need within the Wizard before you go to introduce 
changes in the detailed interface!

Hi Bryan
I used weather converter before and got also some problems but then I
changed my regional settings from(.) to (,) after that it worked i
converted  Energyplus data to Bin data. What is the problem for you
exactly? does the program give an eror  ?

Apologies for cross posting, however I wonder if someone here can help
me:

I'm investigating the potential for thermal labyrinth cooling in a
desert climate such as New Mexico.  Although I haven't looked in detail
at the weather data, I imagine the diurnal range would be sufficient to
provide cool enough night air to dissipate the heat accumulated
within the mass of the labyrinth walls during the day.  At least that's
the idea.  I'm not sure about the best way to prove the effectiveness -
does anyone have experience of design and modelling such a system?  It
would be great if you could give me any suggestion or pointers to
further information and/or design guidance.

In addition I wonder if there are any existing buildings you know of
that utilise such a technique.  It would be great if I could find some
case studies demonstrating successful application of thermal labyrinths
for passive pre-cooling of supply air in hot/desert climates.

Thanks for your help,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] buildings with floors with different shapes in eQuest
Message-ID: <47D1883D.6040204@aiguasol.coop>

Hello,
To create a building with floors that have different shapes with the DD 
Wizard from eQuest, is there any other possibility than creating a 
diffrent shell for each group of floors with the same footprint and 
putting one shell on top of the other? If it is so, I guess that the 
only possibility for the floor that separates both shells is the 
adiabatic condition, and therefore heat transfer betwwen floors is not 
modelled. ?is there another possibility?
Thanks,

Hi,
I am having a problem w/the equest program.  When I run a simulation, it
gets to 18% complete, and the freezes up.  It displays 'ready' in the
bottom right corner, but no calculations are being performed.  If I
click anywhere in the program window, it lists 'not responding'.  I've
already uninstalled and reinstalled the program with similar results.
Is there any way to solve this problem?  I am currently at a dead end
and am not sure of any way to perform a simulation at this point.  Any

The eQUEST download site has all releases including the latest, 3.61e.  There is a version 3.62 that is being used, but it applies more for people doing energy work in Oregon because of the minimum code compliant module built-in to the program.

Are you running in Windows Vista?  If you are, eQUEST must have
administrator privileges to write files where it needs to.  If you are
getting any kind of output file, the end of the .sim file or the .bdl file
should give you an indication of what is going wrong.

I had a similar problem some time ago.  The issue was resolved with 
minimum data loss by opening a new, blank file and then importing the 
.inp file from the original.  I lost my Wizard data but was beyond that 
in the project. 

Good luck!

While trying to model an existing apartment complex, I am running into a
bit of a roadblock- it appears that eQuest only has the option for a
Natural Gas-Fired Boiler, and the building I am modeling has Oil-Fired
Boilers. Does anyone have experience with this issue, or have any
insight as to what might be the best way to model this situation? I
would have thought eQuest would have something as common as an oil-fired
boiler as a standard option for a heat source.

 

Any help is appreciated!

 

Thanks,

Brian,

I did see that option as available, but what I'm unsure of is how the
boiler efficiency will be modeled by eQuest, since Natural Gas is the
only energy option in the DD Wizard. 

Any other thoughts?

Thanks for the quick response.

Can you not simply change the fuel meter for the boiler to an oil fuel

Hello all,

When I try to perform a simulation of my building I get an error message
that says "cooling coil temperature must be at least 6F higher than
entering water temp."  I am using a single zone air handler with
electric heating that is on a chilled water loop, and in the building
creation wizard under this unit it doesn't ask anything specific about
entering and leaving water temperatures.  I trying to find the window
that I need to make this change in so I can run the simulation.  Thanks
for any kind of help that you can provide.

Xavier:
 
Why would you want to do it any other way than with the separate shells and glue them together? If your 2nd floor, for example, is larger and your 1st floor, and you put the floors on top of each other (exactly where you want them to mate), eQuest will make the "adiabatic floor/ceiling" between them where they meet, and have the exposed floor meet the outside (won't see the sun upside down, but will feel the temperature).
 
Which is how reality would expect it to be.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] buildings with floors with different shapes in eQuest


Hello,
To create a building with floors that have different shapes with the DD Wizard from eQuest, is there any other possibility than creating a diffrent shell for each group of floors with the same footprint and putting one shell on top of the other? If it is so, I guess that the only possibility for the floor that separates both shells is the adiabatic condition, and therefore heat transfer betwwen floors is not modelled. ?is there another possibility?
Thanks,

Use 3.61e if you are doing anything other than California Title-24. 3.61b is the first version (i believe) to have the extensive on line manual for "fingertip" answers.
 
3.62 is not yet officially "blessed" - still has a few bugs.
 
3.61e has had many of its bugs fixed - I really have no problem with it.

I?ll echo John on this.  I?ve been using 3.61e for several months and have
had no problems with it so far.  

 

However, as an Oregon user, I?ll be testing the 3.62 Oregon code compliant
version on my next analysis project.

I have been struggling with an issue on a large campus energy model.  I am
trying to model the chilled water system, which is a campus system simply as
metered energy.  I have basically indicated a chilled water meter of the
chilled water loop.  My problem is that when I simply replace a chiller with
the chilled water meter and re-run the model my space cooling energy
consumption goes up dramatically (over 2 times).  I have been working on
this for a long time, and cannot seem to figure out what is causing the
chilled water meter to (virtually) create additional chilled water energy
consumption on the chilled water loop.

Does anyone have familiarity with this issue?

I had a similar problem some time ago.  The issue was resolved with 
minimum data loss by opening a new, blank file and then importing the 
.inp file from the original.  I lost my Wizard data but was beyond that 
in the project. 

Good luck!

Ying, 

You might consider using the weather file for Accra. I think it should
have the same weather conditions. The weather file for Accra is
available from EnergyPlus.

You can also use Meteonorm.

Jaume SalomGreetings-
I have been running 6.0b for a few months.  I would like to upgrade to 6.1e. 

I was a littel confused with the site: http://doe2.com/equest/

Do I need to install 6.1, then 6.1b then 6.1e?  How will this affect my current models.

Any guidance would be appreciated.

Make sure you are looking at comparable reports - the chilled water
demand should be the same in the two cases, but the purchased energy
will be quite different as in one case you are purchasing the chilled
water btu's directly, the other you are purchasing electricity to
produce CHW at some COP, so the two quantities will be different by that
ratio.

Peter:
 
COPY your Projects File and your Weather to off site files (so they still reside as well in the 3.61 folder). Then delete your 6.0b. Re install 3.61e. Your weather and Projects files SHOULD be intact (I always copy them to temp files as a precaution). 3.61e will then run your files JUST FINE. It's trying to run 3.61e files on 3.61B or back that cannot work. No backward compatibility, but no problem with forward compatibility.
 
$5, please...

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Residential or Nonresidental? And sizing for PTAC units.
Message-ID: <3fa6123f0803090030s3f267dfp27b43330f3e5840a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm modeling a 6 story hotel, and am confused with how I should classify the
building.  The hotel is all guest rooms, and is not really mixed use.  So
according to ASHRAE this seems that it would fall under the residential
category, and I would be using PTAC or PTHP systems.  Under table G3.1.1A it
specifically says hotels are considered residential building types, not just
space types... so I assume I'm correct?   However, would I use a VAV or PSZ
system for areas that are not technically guest rooms, or does this not
matter as a hotel is considered a residential "building type"?


Also, when modeling a PTAC system it appears to me that you would get the
EER information from 6.8.1D using the equation, however, sometimes it my
system summary gives me a peak/capacity of a unit as 30KBtu or even 40 for
one room and I know that PTAC units usually don't go much about 20.  So
would the equation in this table still hold?  Finally, if I am getting
varying capacities for each unit as would be expected, would you suggest
taking an average of all the systems, and then use this capacity as the one
to enter into the equation to get the EER and then apply this EER to all
systems across the board?

Thanks so much for the help!

Loren---

You are correct in treating the hotel rooms as residential spaces.  With condo projects, I have served the Appendix G model corridors or first floor offices with a HVAC system that makes more sense, such as packaged rooftop units.  There is wording in Appendix G about parts of the building that fall into other uses:

Exceptions to G3.1.1:
(a) Use additional system type(s) for non-predominant conditions
(i.e., residential/nonresidential or heating source)
if those conditions apply to more than 20,000 ft2 of conditioned
floor area.

This might not apply to your project because of the area threshold, but suggests using different HVAC systems when you have spaces of different end use.

As far as AppG PTAC efficiencies go, I would use the highest capacity in the equation and use that in the model (Resulting EER = 8.805) since you have larger loads.  In an actual project, they would just have to install multiple 1.25 ton PTACs in the room to meet the load.

Good luck,
Andrew

Message-ID: <001401c88253$0d66b370$28341a50$@edu>

Hello,

HELP!!! I am a Purdue University Graduate Student, and I have an equest
model that's fairly well calibrated against real data from a small one-story
office complex. It is set up as a single zone reheat system. This particular
building is very small and utilizes a small electric steam humidifier. I
cannot figure out how to include this in my equest model. I have played with
the humidistat in equest, and when the humidity setpoint is low, I can see
the increased power consumption from the chiller. When the humdiity setpoint
is high, however, I cannot get the system to consume more energy due to the
need for added humdification. Does anybody know how to model a standalone
humidifier in equest. Are there other ways of doing this. Alternatively, Is
there a way I can get the equest model to just add a constant value to the
system's energy consumption if I can measure that value from the real
building? Any help at all would be appreciated.

  Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] current eQuest version - Updates vs. Releases & Vista info


  There are two types of files posted on the DOE2.com eQUEST website, full/complete installations and updates.
  Every link to an update should include the word "update" in the text of the link and either "update" or "upd" in the name of the file that the link downloads.  Minor updates, such as v3.60 to 3.60b often indicate only the updated version in the update file name, in this case "eQ_3-60b_Update_06-08-19.zip".  Updates are posted as either .zip or .exe files.  The ".zip"s are to be unzipped over the base release and ".exe"s (self-extracting zip files) provide a more automated mechanism for updating a release, including a screen which enable the user to specify the directory of the eQUEST version to be updated (that defaults to the default directory name for that release).

  Links to full/complete installations use words including "complete", "installation" and "setup", are always posted as .exe files and the downloaded file always includes the word "Setup".  The full installation files tend to be quite a bit larger than the updates and never require the presence (or absence) of previous versions in order to install properly.
  Multiple versions of eQUEST can peacefully co-exist on a single computer, though once multiple versions are present the user needs to keep closer track of how they start the application and where the projects are being stored in order to prevent projects from being opened or saved by an unintended version.  A simpler approach however is to uninstall previous versions of eQUEST before installing new ones.
  Any project files created by a user SHOULD NOT be removed (by the system) when a version is uninstalled, but to be safe we do recommend that you copy/archive project files to a location not under the eQUEST program directory prior to uninstalling a version.  If a new version of eQUEST is not installed in the same directory as the previous version and access to the projects produced by the previous version is desired, then those older version project files should be manually copied over to the new version's "Projects" subdirectory in order to be easily accessed by the new version.

  VISTA Compatibility:  As stated in a previous post - eQUEST does need "administrator" privileges to operate most effectively (in a manor that is consistent w/ its operation on prior Windows operating systems).  The easiest way we have found to accomplish this is to use Vista's Program Compatibility Wizard.  Here is some guidance on doing this (assuming the default Control Panel settings and a user with administrator privleges):
  (1)  From the start menu, choose Control Panel -> Programs -> under "Programs and Features" choose "Use an older program with this version of Windows", which will start up the "Program Compatibility Wizard"
  (2)  Select the eQUEST program via either selection from a list of programs or "manually" by browsing to the eQUEST program directory ("C:\Program Files\eQUEST X-XX" by default) and selecting eQUEST.exe.
  (3)  We recommend selecting "Microsoft Windows 2000" as the "compatibility mode" for eQUEST
  (4)  No boxes should be checked on the "display settings for the program" screen.
  (5)  Make sure to check the box labeled "Run this program as an administrator" and continue through the wizard following instructions provided.
  We are in the process of designing program changes that will serve to modify the default storage locations of files created and/or modified by eQUEST to prevent the need for using the compatibility wizard on future versions and appreciate your patience as we integrate this work into our pipeline.

      Use 3.61e if you are doing anything other than California Title-24. 3.61b is the first version (i believe) to have the extensive on line manual for "fingertip" answers.



      3.62 is not yet officially "blessed" - still has a few bugs.



      3.61e has had many of its bugs fixed - I really have no problem with it.

Dear all,

For space heating and/or domestic hot water, is there a way to directly
model a hot water loop coming from a heat hydronic heat pump
(fuel:electricity) in eQUEST?

Is there a good workaround via an electric hot water boiler? what would be a
good EIR number for an electric HW Boiler that's connected to such a hot
water loop ? I notice DOE-2's default number in eQUEST is 1.02 but can't
tell if that's a good default to fall back on. The range is as wide as 0 to
10 and the Heat Input Ratio field is greyed out.

Message-ID: <1901717528DF6E4EA2EEB294C11E78503EDD92@MULTIORG1.cgnetmo.org>

Loren,

 

One of the notes under Table G3.1.1A of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 states,
"Residential building types include dormitory, hotel, motel, and
multifamily. Residential space types include guest rooms, living
quarters, private living space, and sleeping quarters. Other building
and space types are considered nonresidential." The User's Manual also
says, "If a building has both residential and nonresidential spaces, for
instance a residential tower with retail and restaurants at the base,
then the HVAC system type is determined separately for the residential
and nonresidential portions."

 

I recently did an energy model for a motel that had first floor retail
spaces, a swimming pool, an indoor parking garage, and a fairly large
lobby. I used realistic systems for these spaces instead of PTACs or
PTHPs. For a different motel I modeled, the nonresidential spaces were
rather insignificant, so I used PTHPs throughout.

 

Regarding which capacity to use for the EER calculation, I would use
realistic capacities. For example, for the space that needs 40 kBTU/h, I
would assume that there would be two 20 kBTU/h units and use 20 kBTU/h
for the capacity in the EER equation.

 

I think the decision to use an average EER for all the units is a
judgment call depending on how complex you want your model to be. It's
the usual trade-off between making assumptions to simplify the model or
adding complexity to get more accuracy (presumably).

Hi All,

I'm modeling a 6 story hotel, and am confused with how I should classify
the building.  The hotel is all guest rooms, and is not really mixed
use.  So according to ASHRAE this seems that it would fall under the
residential category, and I would be using PTAC or PTHP systems.  Under
table G3.1.1A it specifically says hotels are considered residential
building types, not just space types... so I assume I'm correct?
However, would I use a VAV or PSZ system for areas that are not
technically guest rooms, or does this not matter as a hotel is
considered a residential "building type"?


Also, when modeling a PTAC system it appears to me that you would get
the EER information from 6.8.1D using the equation, however, sometimes
it my system summary gives me a peak/capacity of a unit as 30KBtu or
even 40 for one room and I know that PTAC units usually don't go much
about 20.  So would the equation in this table still hold?  Finally, if
I am getting varying capacities for each unit as would be expected,
would you suggest taking an average of all the systems, and then use
this capacity as the one to enter into the equation to get the EER and
then apply this EER to all systems across the board?

Thanks so much for the help!

(Sections 5.4, 6.4, 7.4, 8.4, 9.4 and 10.4) in Standard 90.1- 1999 as
well?

The project will have to comply with the mandatory provisions of 90.1
for EAp2.

Any info that can be shared is greatly appreciated.

I posted a question regarding UFAD last week-Thanks for the responses.  

 

1.	I want to double check and make sure I've made the correct
assumptions for modeling ENVELOPE ONLY in EnergyPro for Title 24
compliance.  My plant, systems and zonal systems are all undefined.  I
did not change my Sq.Ft/Occ. for neither my conditioned spaces nor my
plenum spaces.  Proposed Lighting load is at 1.2 W/sf (office spaces)
and Receptacle/Process sensible heat load is default 0.5 W/sf in both
conditioned spaces and plenum spaces.  (I did not apply the %load
adjustments suggested by your reference document.)  

 

2.	When I leave my plant and systems undefined, am I correct to say
that EnergyPro assumes and sizes the plant and systems for me?  If so,
where can I find these output files?

 

Any confirmation or corrections are greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance--

This is a comment/suggestion for Mr. Criswell and the other eQuest
developers to implement in future releases, and I think it would be helpful
for other eQuest users to comment on their perception of the utility of the
following suggestion:

 

I've run into a few projects now where it would be helpful on the
spreadsheet view for spaces to have an option to show all schedules that
apply to the spaces.  On several projects I've created a number of different
occupancy, lighting, and office equipment schedules for different room uses
(storage, office, conference, classroom, break, etc) both to simulate
diversity and enable detailed ECMs that are based on schedules.  Being able
to make sure each space has the proper set of matched schedules would be,
IMO, made much easier by a schedule comparison tab in the interface.

Thank you both Andrew and Keith,

Understanding the exceptions, and also correct calculations for the EER
(didn't realize there was a limit of 15,000 BTU for the calculation until I
read the small print!) are very helpful.  It brings up another question,
now, though:

When modeling a PTAC unit, and taking this EER value, would you use this to
include the supply fan energy?  G.3.1.2.1 states that you should separate it
into various components, which confuses me a bit.  I know this is getting
down to minutia, however, just trying to make sure I'm doing this
correctly.  If this is something that is common practice to look over, and
just make sure to include the supply fan efficiencies within the EER for
entire unit (something that would make sense to me as it is a packaged
unit), also let me know.

Thanks again,

Loren

Ying,

I believe the correct interpretation is that there are two minimum
efficiency requirements implied by "80% Et(Q/800+110V^1/2) SL, Btu/h".
You don't multiply the two factors together.

The heater must have a minimum efficiency of 80%, and
the standby loss must be less than "(Q/800+110V^1/2)" in Btu/h.
You use these minimum values in your baseline model.

Using your heating and storage capacity numbers below,
SL = (400000/800)+(110*130^.5) = 1754 Btu/h

This is based on 70F temperature difference so
UA = (1754 Btu/h)/70F = 25.06 Btu/h-F

Use this value for your standby loss UA.

Regards,
Bill

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DHW heater efficiency calculations for baseline

The DHW heater efficiency calculations for baseline are based on Table
7.8. For
Gas storage water heaters, the size >75,000 btu/h, and <4000
(Btu/h)/gal, the
baseline performance is:

80% Et(Q/800+110V^1/2) SL, Btu/h = 80%*(400000/800+100*130^1/2).
The input Q for the heater is 400,000 Btu/h, and V is 130 gal. So the SL
calculated is 3077 Btu/h.

Since the SL is defined as standby loss based on 70F temperature
difference
between stored water and ambient requirements, is it right to calculate
the
efficiency by Q-SL/Q? The result is 99.6%, which appears to be so high!

Could anyone show me if it is right or the right calculation for this?

Thanks in advance!

Ying

I am trying to determine chiller power draw at reduced condensing temperatures. The load is constant (100%) for all condensing temps. I have manufacturer data for 100% 90% 80% ... 20% at both constant condensing temperature (85F) and with ARI relief (but a partial loads).

Any suggestions to get full load kW/ton at different condensing temperatures?

Thanks.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Selection of Chilled water system in Energy cost budget
	method
Message-ID: <009501c8839a$727854b0$1cb2a8c0@ZAH>

Hello, All

I got a question about energy simulation for LEED CI. Would you please help to clarify it? 

I am doing the energy simulation for a project pursing CI, which is in a 20-floor-height building. The whole building is served by one HVAC system, and the chilled water system is primary/secondary systems with variable-speed drives on the secondary pumping loop.  Energy cost budget method is used to determine the budget case, which will be system type 1 (chilled water for cooling). In ASHRAE90.1-2004, it is said that 'Pump system power for each pumping system shall be the same as the proposed design; if the proposed design has no chilled water pumps, the budget building design pump power shall be 349 kW/1000 L/s . The chilled water system shall be modeled as primary-only variable flow with flow maintained at the design rate through each chiller using a bypass.' (page 75).   I am confused here. In budget case of my project, shall the chilled water system be primary/secondary systems as proposed case, or be primary-only system?

Thanks & Best Regards,

Han Lin

During Detail Edit, I assigned a control zone to my HVAC systems that
had none listed under spreadsheet view.  After saving several times, I
closed the program.  Upon reopening the control zones were unlisted
again.  I relisted them and saved several times, including to a backup

unlisted. 

 

Has anybody noticed this themselves?

I haven't had to get into that much detail for my energy models (not
LEED), so I won't be much help on this. I suggest finding out from the
manufacturer if the published EER includes fan power or not.

Thank you both Andrew and Keith,

Understanding the exceptions, and also correct calculations for the EER
(didn't realize there was a limit of 15,000 BTU for the calculation
until I read the small print!) are very helpful.  It brings up another
question, now, though: 

When modeling a PTAC unit, and taking this EER value, would you use this
to include the supply fan energy?  G.3.1.2.1 states that you should
separate it into various components, which confuses me a bit.  I know
this is getting down to minutia, however, just trying to make sure I'm
doing this correctly.  If this is something that is common practice to
look over, and just make sure to include the supply fan efficiencies
within the EER for entire unit (something that would make sense to me as
it is a packaged unit), also let me know.

Thanks again,

Loren

One of the notes under Table G3.1.1A of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 states,
"Residential building types include dormitory, hotel, motel, and
multifamily. Residential space types include guest rooms, living
quarters, private living space, and sleeping quarters. Other building
and space types are considered nonresidential." The User's Manual also
says, "If a building has both residential and nonresidential spaces, for
instance a residential tower with retail and restaurants at the base,
then the HVAC system type is determined separately for the residential
and nonresidential portions."

 

I recently did an energy model for a motel that had first floor retail
spaces, a swimming pool, an indoor parking garage, and a fairly large
lobby. I used realistic systems for these spaces instead of PTACs or
PTHPs. For a different motel I modeled, the nonresidential spaces were
rather insignificant, so I used PTHPs throughout.

 

Regarding which capacity to use for the EER calculation, I would use
realistic capacities. For example, for the space that needs 40 kBTU/h, I
would assume that there would be two 20 kBTU/h units and use 20 kBTU/h
for the capacity in the EER equation.

 

I think the decision to use an average EER for all the units is a
judgment call depending on how complex you want your model to be. It's
the usual trade-off between making assumptions to simplify the model or
adding complexity to get more accuracy (presumably).

Hi All,

I'm modeling a 6 story hotel, and am confused with how I should classify
the building.  The hotel is all guest rooms, and is not really mixed
use.  So according to ASHRAE this seems that it would fall under the
residential category, and I would be using PTAC or PTHP systems.  Under
table G3.1.1A it specifically says hotels are considered residential
building types, not just space types... so I assume I'm correct?
However, would I use a VAV or PSZ system for areas that are not
technically guest rooms, or does this not matter as a hotel is
considered a residential "building type"?


Also, when modeling a PTAC system it appears to me that you would get
the EER information from 6.8.1D using the equation, however, sometimes
it my system summary gives me a peak/capacity of a unit as 30KBtu or
even 40 for one room and I know that PTAC units usually don't go much
about 20.  So would the equation in this table still hold?  Finally, if
I am getting varying capacities for each unit as would be expected,
would you suggest taking an average of all the systems, and then use
this capacity as the one to enter into the equation to get the EER and
then apply this EER to all systems across the board?

Thanks so much for the help!

Assuming this is a fixed-speed centrifugal chiller, a reasonable first cut
is that the power is proportional to the lift (compressor pressure out-
pressure in).  Look at the refrigerant pressures at the expected condensing
and evaporating temperatures, and ratio the lift at the new condensing temp
to the lift at the old condensing temp.
 
This approach neglects the change in compressor efficiency that probably
occurs, but I've done this in the past prior to getting a complete chiller
map, and the approach works out pretty well.  It also matches with the
common rule of thumb that the power changes 1 to 2% per deg F change in
condensing temp.
 
With nagging, it may be possible to get a complete chiller map from the
manufacturer.  You can almost certainly get it in a competitive procurement
situation.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modeling partly exposed roof in each floor with eQUEST
Message-ID: <860618.34539.qm@web32107.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello, all,

I have a question regarding modeling roof in eQUEST. In the high-rise building that I am going to model, each floor will have partly exposed floor (the bottom floor has the largest footprint and gradually reduced foot print in the upper floors) and shape is complicated. 

Does someone has some experience to model the roof? Since each floor has partly exposed roof, when I model the roof as adiabatic, then the exposed roof will be missing. If I model the whole floor with roof, then lots of roof will be redundant. If I delete these redundant roof, then some zones will be exposed to the exterior without roof while there should be some roof area.

I found it is difficult to create roof shape with plolygon in eQUEST. Is the separation of the parts with and without roof into different shells the best way to model this condition or is there any better methods?

Thanks a lot for your help.

Regards,

David

I BELIEVE, Sir, that eQuest will treat any exposed roof will be roof and
any adiabatic floor to floor will be floor.
 
Where you can get goofed up is a plenum that covers the entire floor.
Try to keep each space with its own plenum, or can the plenums all
together.

For an 90.1, it asks you to separate the fan from the compressor.  This is because the standard will ask for fans to run constantly, however if you have a combined EER (entered as cooling-EIR) the fan power will not be calculated when the compressor cycles off.
 
That may be okay for non-App G analysis, particularly if your project will cycle with the compressor.

You hit on one of eQUEST's weaknesses.  When you model one shell on 
another, eQUEST does not determine the exposed roof area.  You either 
put a roof on the entire lower shell or on none of the lower shell.  I 
tend to put no roof (adiabatic as you suggested) on the lower shells 
then in the detailed edit I add equivalent area roofs on the lower zones 
with exposed roof areas.  I don't tend to create the roof polygons 
(unless the 3D image is really important to the client), I just add 
square roofs of equivalent area to the lower zones or plenums. 

Hope this helps. (Can't wait until this one is resolved. -- I discovered 
it when I built a building with 4 stacked shells and ended up with 
triple the expected roof area -- hard to explain in a design meeting!)

Dear All,

I am trying to model PV Collecotrs on top of a roof by using the

?mit,

I had the same thing happen to me yesterday (which was the first time I tried doing an electric generator).  I actually had to use the Windows Task Manager to close eQUEST because the warning window kept opening again every time I closed it.  I eventually stopped getting the warnings after I filled in all the blank fields in the "Basic Specifications" and "PV Array" tabs (including the "Operating Limits/Conditions" tab under the PV Array tab).

A good resource for filling in these fields is the SMA website:
http://www.sma-america.com/solar-technology/products/grid-tied-inverters/sunny-boy/index.html
They also have a string sizing program:
http://america.sma.de/newstringsizing.aspx

Xantrex and SatCon are also good resources, especially for larger systems.

Bill

Another thing you can do from the wizard mode is make a zone or zones
with interior walls that are directly below the exterior wall of the
shell above it.  Then it is easy to remove the roofs from the interior
zones and leave them on the spaces where they are needed.  If the
interior wall(s) that you create are not actually in the design, make
them "air" walls.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Modeling partly exposed roof in each floorwith
eQUEST

You hit on one of eQUEST's weaknesses.  When you model one shell on 
another, eQUEST does not determine the exposed roof area.  You either 
put a roof on the entire lower shell or on none of the lower shell.  I 
tend to put no roof (adiabatic as you suggested) on the lower shells 
then in the detailed edit I add equivalent area roofs on the lower zones

with exposed roof areas.  I don't tend to create the roof polygons 
(unless the 3D image is really important to the client), I just add 
square roofs of equivalent area to the lower zones or plenums. 

Hope this helps. (Can't wait until this one is resolved. -- I discovered

it when I built a building with 4 stacked shells and ended up with 
triple the expected roof area -- hard to explain in a design meeting!)

Message-ID: <2253.62.8.254.35.1205330374.squirrel@unimail.uni-dortmund.de>

Dear all,

my second question today. I would like to be sure if my understanding is
right or not about not met loads. Currently  I am trying to fill up the
LEED EA Credit 1 submittal. Section 1.3 Advisory Messages There are :
1. Number of hours heating loads not met
2. Number of hours cooling loads not met

I turn back to my e-Quest outputs ( BEPS Report) in the report I read:

a. PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE (Question:
this value is number of heating loads or should be written in LEED
submittal?)(20,9 for Proposed and 23,0 for Baseline, I am not mechanical
engineer but as much as I understood from ASHRAE number of hours not met
should not exceed 300)
b. PERCENT OF HOURS ANY PLANT LOAD NOT SATISFIED ( Question: this value is
for both number of hours heating and cooling not met or just for
Cooling?)(Both in baseline and Proposed 0,0)

regards

Short answer:  don't worry - that message has no affect on your model or 
simulation results.

Long answer:
The error message "Unable to locate default data for Command=..." is 
posted by the user interface, not DOE-2, and is reporting the lack of 
information the user interface is looking for in order to know how to 
display certain required inputs that it needs to collect from the user, 
such as descriptive labels for inputs and decimal precision of numeric 
values.  After posting this error message, the interface continues on to 
collect the required inputs using the DOE-2 keyword names and input 
labels and default decimal precision settings, so that in the end the 
required data IS collected and the occurrence of the user interface 
error does not affect the building model itself.

Umit-

I'm not sure if I fully understand your question but I'll try to help you
out.  The number of hours that are not met can be found in the summary tab
of the "Air-side HVAC" tab in eQuest.  It's also listed in the .sim file,
but its easily found within eQuest.  The BEPS report does not give the
number of hours, rather just the percentage.  If your model is showing over
20% of the hours out of range you will definitely need to go back and resize
your systems.

thank you very much indeed, yes you understood my question right. I was
just not sure because in the archiv of Bldg-sim I read that the results
can be found in BEPS and SS-F for each Zone.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest Title Changes to Parameteric Runs
Message-ID: <000901c88459$671abb20$35503160$@com>

I have liked to add explicit titles changes to parametric run title so I can
easily distinguish each run when reviewing the output reports.  I have done
this using the "Title" Component Type in the past.   However, when using
3.61e I can't seem to make it work.  It is apparent that changes have been
made to the Parametric Run Definitions input window which now includes a
"Category" drop down column in the Data Modification area.

 

The Component Type "Title" does appear in the 3rd row dropdown list, and a
checkbox is displayed in the References box when I select "Title".
However, it does not  have an adjacent label identifying what the check box
is for.  I would expect it to display "Title".  This was also occurring in
eQuest 3.61b, but all other parametric changes worked properly using 6.61b. 

 

My issues seem to be occurring in the Data Modifications portion of the
Parametric Run Definitions window.  Under the Category column, my only drop
down menu choice is " - none -" after selecting "Title" as a Component Type.
I would expect it to display blank (just as the label next to the checkbox)
or "Title".  Because I am unable to make a Category choice, I am unable to
access the KEYWORD drop down selection box.  That is where I would expect
"LINE-1", "LINE-2", etc. to be available for selection to identify what
title I want changed for the run.  

 

Has anyone else experienced this?  Does anyone know a work around?

Did anyone respond on this?
As best as I can tell, addendum ac to 90.1-2004 revised the Ch. 6 fan power limitation but not Appendix G's baseline fan power.  But now in 90.1-2007, Apdx. G looks aligned with Ch. 6.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] USGBC- LEED NC 2.2 / ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G- Labs applications

Hello Modelers.

I am looking for information/experience with applying the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 , Appendix G for labs.

It is well known that  Appendix G cannot be used properly for labs. The ECB and Labs 21 fixed many of the problems and now they are part of the 2007 version ( not as addenda to the 2004 version). USGBC refers to the 2004 version , but also allows the use of 2004 addenda (per USGBC memo from April 26 2007). I am wondering if anybody knows what is the position of USGBC regarding the 2007 appendix G changes.

Thanks

Itzhak

I've encountered the same problem. It is easy to add VSD to chillers, pumps and towers. But not sure how to simulate it's control algorithm such as having each chiller simultaneously run at the same loading 
rather than conventional sequence control.

Message-ID: <459908de0803131451p711225c1j12790f867b59625f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,
I'm working on a (LEED) project that is heated and cooled entirely with
passive strategies, and we'd like to claim energy savings for EA credit 1.
I would like to model the proposed building with the passive strategies,
prove that there are not excessive hours of loads unmet, and compare it to a
Baseline model with an HVAC system.  90.1 does say explicitly that it
doesn't apply to buildings that don't use electricity or natural gas,
though.  Is there another code/ rating system that applies to passive
buildings?  Has anyone ever applied Appendix G to a passively designed
building to show savings for LEED?

Thanks for your input.
Aleka

Message-ID: <47D9465B.01DF.005E.0@archenergy.com>

For the purposes of LEED analysis, I have 3 questions:
 
1.  is the cost comparison (ES-D) between:  
 
PROJECT NAME - T24 Standard Building.SIM 
and 
PROJECT NAME - T24 Proposed Building.SIM
 
or are these two compared:
 
PROJECT NAME - T24 Standard Building.SIM 
and
PROJECT NAME - Baseline Design.SIM (i.e. just the regular building without any T24 requirements)
 
2.  I realize that process energy needs to be included for these runs, but are there any other ways in which the auto-generated T24 models need to be modified (as compared to a Title 24 analysis)?
 
3.  What are we allowed to modify from T24 in the Proposed that Title 24 doesn't allow you to modify (schedules?)?

The eQuest developers have been noticeably quiet about this.  I suspect

Message-ID: <59A7B0D103185D4D9FB3A714DD4CAC3927563E@sbssvr.Fuller.local>

Hello all,

I am modeling a four floor building in which there are many multi-level
spaces. Each floor of the building has a different footprint and I have
created a shell for each.  Some of the multi-level spaces are two floors
high, some three, and some four.  The lowest level may start at the 1st,
2nd, or 3rd floor.  When I create a multi-level space with the 1st floor
as the lowest level things work fine, the 3-D geometry shows up as it
should.  When I create a similar space in which the lowest floor is not
the 1st floor then the roof and walls do not go up to the top level of
the space.

 

I am working in the wizard and using the zone characteristics button
(wizard screen 2 of 25 of the shell component) to modify the thermal
zones.  In the first instance (when the geometry works well), I am given
the opportunity to input the conditioned height.  In the second (things
don't work well), the conditioned height input box does not appear.

 

Can this be fixed within the wizard or do I have to fix it in detailed
mode?  If this were just one space I wouldn't bother to ask.  But it is
many, many spaces.

 

Sincerely, 

 

Daniel T. O'Carroll, EI

I am trying to determine if LEED-NC is a viable avenue for an existing
building.
 
We are going to use the existing boilers and chiller.  
 
My question is, what are the requirements for the existing boiler and
chiller efficiencies.  Do we have to meet the performance requirements
of section 6 in 90.1?
 
Does anyone have experience with this?

Mike,
I'm running XP SP2, so that's not an issue.  I checked the bdl file and
sim file, no obvious issues.

Are you running in Windows Vista?  If you are, eQUEST must have
administrator privileges to write files where it needs to.  If you are
getting any kind of output file, the end of the .sim file or the .bdl
file should give you an indication of what is going wrong.

Hi, 
I am having a problem w/the equest program.  When I run a simulation, it
gets to 18% complete, and the freezes up.  It displays 'ready' in the
bottom right corner, but no calculations are being performed.  If I
click anywhere in the program window, it lists 'not responding'.  I've
already uninstalled and reinstalled the program with similar results.
Is there any way to solve this problem?  I am currently at a dead end
and am not sure of any way to perform a simulation at this point.  Any
help would be greatly appreciated. thx.

I had a similar problem some time ago.  The issue was resolved with
minimum data loss by opening a new, blank file and then importing the
.inp file from the original.  I lost my Wizard data but was beyond that
in the project. 

Good luck!

Daniel,
 
The way I have always done this is by making that specific zone the same
up through all the shells, so if there was a 3 story atrium the "atrium
zone" on the lowest floor would define the height of the atrium, the
"atrium zone" in the second and third shells I would specify open to
below.  I am not completely certain that this is the correct way of
doing this, does anyone know if this is the best way to model multi
story spaces?

Hello all,

I am modeling a four floor building in which there are many multi-level
spaces. Each floor of the building has a different footprint and I have
created a shell for each.  Some of the multi-level spaces are two floors
high, some three, and some four.  The lowest level may start at the 1st,
2nd, or 3rd floor.  When I create a multi-level space with the 1st floor
as the lowest level things work fine, the 3-D geometry shows up as it
should.  When I create a similar space in which the lowest floor is not
the 1st floor then the roof and walls do not go up to the top level of
the space.

 

I am working in the wizard and using the zone characteristics button
(wizard screen 2 of 25 of the shell component) to modify the thermal
zones.  In the first instance (when the geometry works well), I am given
the opportunity to input the conditioned height.  In the second (things
don't work well), the conditioned height input box does not appear.

 

Can this be fixed within the wizard or do I have to fix it in detailed
mode?  If this were just one space I wouldn't bother to ask.  But it is
many, many spaces.

 

Sincerely,

I had a similar problem once and it turned out to be the result of a blip in
the weather file.  I can't remember which file it was (one of the standardly
available TMY/TMY2), but perhaps try running your model with a different
one.  Or, run the model with 'pause on errors', and that should give you a
better idea of where the problem is coming from.

Cheers,
Aleka

Franc,

 

Thanks for the reply.  I have done exactly what you are suggesting and
it works for me if the lowest level of the multi-level space corresponds
to the lowest shell.  However, if the lowest level of the multi-level
space does not correspond to the lowest shell then it does not work for
me.

 

Have you had success using this feature when the multi-level space does
not sit on the ground floor?

Thanks,

Dan

Hello friends,

Anyone know what the BASELINE system should be if the design system is a
ground source heat pump?  I have a non-residential building, 3 floors and <
75,000 square feet.  The design system type is groundsource heat pump, which
leads to system 4-PSZ-HP, which nobody would ever choose for this climate
(Burlington, VT).

Any thoughts?

I specified only an electric screw chiller.  There is no "Engine Driven"
chiller or any piece of equipment that provides cooling which consumes
Natural Gas.

Somehow, you seem to have a chiller/heater specified. Are you SURE you
specified an electric chiller (you said CENTRAL chiller)?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Equest - Space Cooling Provided by Natural Gas!?

I am modeling a New Orleans High School with a VAV system with Electric
Heat.  The packaged rooftop units have Heating Hot Water Coils served by
a Center Boiler and Chilled Water Coils served by a Central Chiller.  

 

For some strange reason, my summer and spring months have some space
cooling provided by Natural Gas Consumption.  Since the boiler is the
only equipment consuming Natural Gas, how is the boiler providing
cooling?  Very odd.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Large Unmet Heating/Cooling in Baseline
Message-ID: <003c01c88609$cee37560$2c01a8c0@rob>

I am modeling a school gymnasium building that has two gyms and a two story
office/locker room wing.  The office/locker room wing has several zones that
have very different loads, but are designed to all be served by the same
packaged, constant volume, 100% outside air ERV.  In the design case model,
heating is supplied to these zones primarily by HW baseboards, while cooling
loads are satisfied by the supply air.

Appendix G dictates that the baseline HVAC system be Type 3, PSZ-AC with
constant volume DX cooling and furnace heating (no reheat).  When modeling
this system type, I am getting a large amount of unmet heating and cooling
hours (as many as 1,500 hours for a given zone) in the office/locker room
zones.  My guess is that this is happening because the baseline HVAC system
has no heat source at the zone level (where the proposed case has
baseboards), and many of the slave zones have very different heating/cooling
loads than the control zone.  I am not sure how I can adjust the model to
eliminate these unmet hours while still being consistent with Appendix G.
The only method that has worked for me so far is to drastically increase the
system supply flow, but this creates large fan savings that may not be
reasonable.  Is it appropriate to add zone reheat even though it is not
called for in Appendix G? 

 

Hopefully I've presented my problem clearly enough.  Any help would be much
appreciated!

 

Thanks,

Hi all,

Can some one please guide me on how to define and control the outdoor
air in a Compact HVAC system? 

 

I have set the outdoor air method to "flow/person" at the zone level.
The occupancy profiles are set. However the results show a constant
volume flow rate of mechanical ventilation air intake. Shouldn't the
outside air intake vary with the occupancy? What other schedules/objects
may be effecting the calculation of outdoor air flow?

Please help,

You can ALWAYS regenerate any file outputs with the .PD2, .INP, and (if
parametrics are used) the .PRD files. All others can be canned.

Possible answer.
 
Your Flr 1 East VAV has a Solid Desiccant System attached to it, the
only system which does. As I perceive it, Desiccant is a
dehumidification device, which eQuest MAY interpret as cooling. You
attach it to a hot water loop to recharge the desiccant, so gas is used
for a "cooling" purpose.

Rob -

 

I ran into the same problem, only with a much more complex building.
Mike's approach should work fine for the number of zones you have.
However, I don't think Appendix G precludes reheat for a PSZ-AC baseline
system. For System type 3, heat source is specified as fossil fuel
furnace in Table G3.1.1B (furnaces can serve individual zones), but I
don't see where it says you can't use reheat. Section G3.1.3 addresses
system specific baseline system requirements, but none of the
subsections therein say anything about System type 3. I don't see it
address in G3.1.2, either. In reality, PSZ's are known to be pretty
lousy at maintaining space temperature setpoints even with reheat.

 

-Lynn

I am in need of some help and guidance on using E-Quest to qualify for 
LEED credits.  I am working on a California project with water source 
heat pumps, that was initially analyzed using Energy Pro and showed 
barely passing Title-24 requirements.   The majority of high usage was 
in the cooling tower fans, which appeared to be modeled as running 
whenever a cooling load was present.   We were then asked to try for 
LEED certification and knowing that the Energy Pro run was barely 
passing, we needed a better modeling tool and probably a more efficient 
system.  In order to model this better, we decided to use E-Quest so we 
could put individual cooling tower cells into the model and also use 
some add-ons provided by Climate Master for their higher efficiency 
units .  The first run of E-Quest failed to pass the Title-24 
requirements. 

I admit to being inexperienced on E-Quest, but I did read everything I 
could find and followed every guidance I could find, but I could fine 
nothing about using E-Quest to compare with ASHRAE 90.1 (which I believe 
is an option for LEED certification).  I also believe that when the 
Title-24 compliance run is done, some default values are used that may 
make our project seem less efficient, so I am trying to work around that 
as well.

I would appreciate hearing any ideas that anyone has, but I would most 
appreciate finding some written guidance regarding using E-Quest to 
qualify for LEED certification.  Alternatively, any written guidance 
that is available regarding using E-Quest for comparison with ASHRAE 
90.1 (which I do believe would allow for LEED certification) would be 
helpful.  I have found nothing on these topics in any of the published 
E-Quest documentation that I have found.  One guide says that comparison 
with 90.1 is "planned for the future" but that is about it.  That guide 
was published in 2003, so I hope that we are in the future, but I do not 
know for sure.

Lastly, if anyone has any written or anecdotal guidance regarding using 
E-Quest to show compliance with Title-24, I'd really like to see that 
too.  Is there something that prevents E-Quest from using the actual 
model set (not the defaults) that can be defeated to show compliance?  
Again, I am not asking for somebody to show me how to do it, just for 
somebody to show me an FAQ or a publication of some sort that I can use 
in this situation.

Lastly, if I fail to figure this out, if there is someone who would be 
willing to work as a consultant on the project, please contact me 
off-list at 916 966 9060 or via robert at wichert.org .  E-Mail is probably 
best.

Thanks for your time in reading this and for any advice that you might 
provide.

Christopher,

 

I've been working through issues with this same message, and here is
what I have found so far:

The entering water temperature comes from the chilled water loop "Design
CHW Temp" value.

The cooling coil temperature comes from the HVAC system's "Cooling" tab,
the "Coil Cap/Control" subtab, the "Cold Deck Min Leaving Temp" value.

 

A related issue that I have found is that if you specify the "Zone
Entering Min Supply Temp" on the same tab and subtab, and if you specify
a Supply Delta T on the "Fans" tab "Fan Power and Control" subtab, then
the program will give you the same error message if the "Zone Entering
Min Supply Temp" minus the "Supply Fan Delta T" is less than 6 degrees
greater than the "Design CHW Temp" value.

 

It would be nice if there were two separate message for these
conditions.  It would also be nice if this error could be made into a
warning instead, since we occasionally have a 5 degree difference on
coils with large numbers of coil rows.

 

I hope this helps.

Hello all,

When I try to perform a simulation of my building I get an error message
that says "cooling coil temperature must be at least 6F higher than
entering water temp."  I am using a single zone air handler with
electric heating that is on a chilled water loop, and in the building
creation wizard under this unit it doesn't ask anything specific about
entering and leaving water temperatures.  I trying to find the window
that I need to make this change in so I can run the simulation.  Thanks

Robert,

You are correct in that presently eQuest does not have a built-in 90.1
compliance module.  You will have to create two buildings using Appendix
G (Performance Rating Method) as a guide: one will be the ASHRAE
reference building, and the other will be your actual design, which has
to comply with the mandatory provisions of 90.1 (sections 5.4, 6.4, 7.4,
8.4, 9.4 and 1.4).

Personally I can't wait for the compliance module.

Hope that helps.

Steve...

I agree with your comments... We have developed a couple of free 
design tools that might be of 
interest:  www.aud.ucla.edu/energy-design-tools  HEED (Home Energy 
Efficient Design) will show graphically the time lagged heat flow 
through each of the different building elements, including slab edge 
loss. The Thermal Mass screen lets you explicitly define the mass 
inside the insulated envelope. To see the plot of heat flow into and 
out of this mass you can run a 12-day analysis from the Climate 
screen. One of our other programs called OPAQUE will calculate the 
required time lag and decrement as well as U-factor of any wall section.

Dear all,

For LEED EA Credit 1:

How does proposed design model take credit over a baseline design model in
terms of increased space heating efficiency in a setting where the building
is using steam from the campus central facility? Is there something in
ASHRAE 90.1 that addresses this?
Is the efficiency of the steam producing equipment and the source-to-site
efficiency constant between the two models?

Thanks,

Ramana Koti.

2) Define 2nd floor like 1st in Design Development Wizard. Then go to

Remember - do ALL changes you can in the Wizard mode. Once you get to

Message-ID: <47DE543A.2D7D.00A5.0@aeieng.com>

Hi there,

I have a question regarding chilled beams in eQUEST. I read the
articles on the Bldg-sim web site and tried to confirm my approach but
the information there is very general and inconclusive:

My inputs according to the building design: Using IU in eQUEST
SA temperature = 48F (entered as zone entering min. supply temp.)
AHU CHW loop temperature = 42F (created a primary loop)
CB CHW loop temperature = 57F (created a secondary loop based on the
gpm - % to primary)
Room set point temp. = 75F

Getting an error message:
C coil leaving temp. must be at least 6F higher than entering water
temp. 

Unclear:
- Is the ?zone entering min. supply temp.? a temperature of air
coming from the AHU or it is a temperature anticipating the induction
ratio (such as induction ratio of 3, i.e. 1portion of air at 48F and
3portions of air at 75F >> (1*48+3*75)/4 = 68.25F ??? (Does IU treat the
SA as only air from the MUA / OA unit or does it treat the SA as the mix
of return air and OA)
- In the cooling tab is the CHW Coil Delta T a temperature related to
the CC of the AHU or CB ???
- It doesn?t allow a SA temp. lower than a CHW temp???


Thanks,
Norbert

Hi Mark,

1)  You can change the wall type for one wall only in the detailed edit mode
after you are finished with the wizard.  Just beware that if you make
changes in detailed mode, and go back to wizard mode, your detail mode
changes will be lost.

2)  To create a building with different floorplans for each floor, make a
new shell for each floor.  On wizard screen 1, "General Shell Information,"
position floor 2 immediately above floor 1.  You may also want to specify
exact site coordinates so that the floors line up properly.

Good Luck,

~Karen~

Karen,

 

I agree with your interpretation -- the system would be 4-PSZ-HP -
assuming you are using the 2004 edition of ASHARE 90.1. The User's
Manual states that if the heating energy source for the proposed
building is electricity, then the heating energy source for the baseline
building has to be electricity too. This system would not actually be
used in Wisconsin either. Fortunately for me, the utility programs that
I model for allow me to use "engineering judgment" (common sense), so I
can use a realistic system for the baseline. But if you have to go by
the book, then 4-PSZ-HP it is! I can see how this could overstate the
savings for a ground-source heat pump system in a cold climate like
ours.

Hello friends,

Anyone know what the BASELINE system should be if the design system is a
ground source heat pump?  I have a non-residential building, 3 floors
and < 75,000 square feet.  The design system type is groundsource heat
pump, which leads to system 4-PSZ-HP, which nobody would ever choose for
this climate (Burlington, VT).

Any thoughts?

Thanks for all the comments.  This is for LEED EA Credit 1.  The system has
no fossil fuel supplementation, so PSZ-HP it is.  The poor baseline benefits
the project in terms of LEED points, however, this leads to something I've
been thinking...

Why not use the same baseline for all buildings?  Or at least make baseline
system selection appropriate for different climate zones.  This baseline
would make choosing electric resistance heat look somewhat reasonable in
this climate.  Use of electric resistance heat is actually no longer legal
in the state of Vermont for commercial construction.

You can check the .CAL file to find _some_ information on why the building didn't pass T24.  Check for spaces that are outside the throttling range in the SIM files.  Verify that your constructions in the compliance section are from the Joint Appendices.
 
Also, if you brought the model into eQuest by opening the INP and making a new eQuest PD2 file, verify that the weather file is correct.

The system selection does self-regulate to some degree based on the
predominant conditions in any particular location, climate and energy
prices.  I think it probably hits the mark much more than it misses in
Vermont, although you have found an exception.

 

As you mention, a project putting in PSZ-HP in Vermont is probably not
anywhere close to using Appendix G.  I doubt very many LEED projects in
that region end up taking the electric heating path, most will be on the
natural gas side.  Are you seeing many geothermal projects in the area?

 

Someday, if geothermal heat pumps became the conventional type of
system, then a revision to the standard would definitely be in order.

 

Obviously it would be misleading to tell your client that they are
saving that much money per year, you may want to perform some
intermediate system selection for that purpose.

 

David

Hi Eric and others,

Our firm is currently trying to evaluate the various simulation programs to
select the one that may be best for us.  We're currently using VisualDOE and
testing out eQuest, but are also starting to look at Trace.  I like the
flexibility that VisualDOE offers regarding geometry but also know it is a
bit behind using the 2.1E engine instead of the 2.2 found in eQuest, and
then we may be starting to model VRV systems which is something that only
Trace can do as far as I am aware.

So what I am asking is if anyone has any information comparing the various
programs or any opinions or advice as to where to find more information.  It
seems to me that the majority of modelers are using eQuest right now, and
I'm not sure if that's just cause of the wonderfully cheap price of free or
it really has many advantages over the others.  Any help would be great.

Thanks so much!

Loren,
 
TRACE is able to model variable refrigerant systems as you have
indicated below.  If you want to evaluate TRACE, you certainly can using
our demo version.  It's not limited in terms of trial period, however
the number of rooms and the output is limited.  If you wanted to
download it, you can find it at
http://trane.com/Commercial/DesignAnalysis/DownloadCenter.aspx?i=909.
You can use the drop-down boxes to limit the search for the TRACE Demo.
If you have questions about the program, let me know.

Hi folks,

I am simulating a 24-floor building to be LEED certified. The software is
Equest. In order to achieve as many points as possible in EA CR1,
demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) has been modeled in the proposed design.
But we are not sure if this stragety needs Exception Calculation Method
requested by USGBC. In one of CIR historical archive of LEED online, USGBC
requested exceptional calculation method for schedule-based DCV models. I
have no idea if USGBC would treat DCV models in Equest as those of
schedule-based.

The use or removal of DCV will decisively impact the achieveable points of
EA CR1. I am wondering if anyone in this community has clear picture on this
issue.

Thanks in advance.

Hello,

 

I was wondering if anyone has any experience modeling Indirect-fired
water heaters in eQuest.  I am trying to model a small apartment complex
that has their boiler feeding the domestic hot water loop through
several of these heaters that are essentially just heat exchangers
supplying DHW to a storage tank.  I can't seem to find much information
on this type of arrangement.  I could just assign the DHW load to the HW
loop and define the pumps correctly, but that would not take into
account the storage or correct supply temperature.  It doesn't appear to
be possible to connect the HW and DHW loops directly either. 

 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Jessi,
I got a LEED submittal review last month that didn't allow modeling DCV in
eQuest without using the 'exceptional calculation method'.  You can model
DCV with the keyword in eQuest, but (some) LEED reviewers want to see
savings isolated from the measure.  It just ends up being a bit more
modeling/ reporting time on our end.

Unlike the experience that Aleka Pappas described, I have never been asked
by the USGBC to provide an Exception Calculation Method when using DCV in
eQuest.  This only proves that the review process is not consistent...
 
Regardless, I've only modeled DCV using the minimum flow control options
under the Air-side HVAC tab within the thermal zones (MIN-FLOW-CTRL).  You
have the option of DCV with reset up, reset up/down, or reset down.     
 
If you're trying to model DCV in a different way, you probably should
provide documentation for an Exceptional Calculation Method.  These are not
hard to put together.  On the EAc1 template, there is a specific area that
you'll need to fill in - essentially describing the method you've used and
your reasons for it along with the energy and cost savings that method is
calculating.  Read the instructions on the template - they're pretty
straightforward.  
 
When I've done Exceptional Calculations Methods in the past, I've created a
new proposed case model as the USGBC will want to see output from the
proposed case model with the Exceptional Calcs and without it.  You'll
document Table 1.8.2 on the EAc1 template with the data reported in the
proposed case model without the Exceptional Calculation Method.

Follow up question. I have just run a building using a DVC method and have
seen a significant savings between 20% and 30%. Does this surprise anybody?
(It surprised me, but cannot find any errors in the model). It is an all
electric building in the Northeast region. Thanks for any input.

Hi folks,
I am trying to model an office building that is served by an energy recovery ventilator (ERV) w/ heating and water source heat pumps. The ERV supplies 100% fresh air to conditioned spaces, and the heat pumps provides space cooling and heating. In general, each room/space has one ceiling mounted heat pump. I have two questions:
1. How to handle the relationship of ERV and heat pumps in eQUEST for this case? The difficulty for me is that in eQUEST one space only can be served by one air system and an air system must have at least one zone for service.2. How to handle the boilers in the water loop of heat pumps and hot water loop of ERV? In reality, the water loop of heat pumps connects to hot water loop through heat exchanger.
 
Thanks!
George

Hi All,

I am new to eQuest, and am using version 3.60 (build 5200).

I have a question regarding the Hourly Reports Entry : Temp of air  
leaving heat coil - hot deck temp (deg F) (under HVAC system).

Disregard of the building locations, building configurations (single  
zone, multi-zones), system type (CAV, VAV), the "Temp of air leaving  
heat coil" is always very cold, and even colder than "Temp of air  
entering coil" during winter heating season. However, at the same time  
"Total central heat coil output (Btu/hr)" indicates there is heat  
output, just that it is not reflected in the "Temp of air leaving heat  
coil".

I would appreciate any advices. Thanks in advance.

Under Primary System < Heating < Coil Cap / Control, you will see "Hot Deck Max Leaving Temp". This will specify the temperature of the air leavint the hot deck. From the eQUEST help file for Heat-Set-T:

"For variable-volume systems, specifying HEAT-SET-T enables a main air-handler heating coil; the value in this case is the maximum temperature off of this coil. For single duct systems (VAVS, PVAVS and PIU), the default is MIN-SUPPLY-T (indicating no central heating coil).

On occasion, you may not want the control point of the hot deck to be equal to MAX-SUPPLY-T. A variable-volume system has the potential of supplying 100% outside air (and therefore cold air) to the zone VAV box. Preheat will raise the supply temperature up to PREHEAT-T, but only the main heating coil can hold a constant supply air temperature or the modified temperature of a WARMEST or RESET controller. Use of HEAT-SET-T for systems SZRH and PSZ is discouraged because it simply overrides the maximum leaving air temperature specified by MAX-SUPPLY-T."

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Lab Core&Shell Modeling
Message-ID: <018d01c88a12$07645740$2501a8c0@Mickey>

We are working on a laboratory building that will be pursuing LEED Core &
Shell.  We are trying to confirm the modeling requirements for heat recovery
and laboratory supply airflow control.  It appears that these two questions
are interrelated.  

 

Based on Appendix G section 3.1.2.10, it appears that if we model heat
recovery in the proposed case, we will need to model it in the base building
also. (Note the building is in climate zone 5a)  Can anyone please confirm
that lab heat recovery can not be counted as savings?  It is my
understanding that this supersedes Section 6.5.6.1 discussion of energy
recovery, is this correct?

 

The core air handling units design supply and exhaust rates are based on 2.0
cfm/sf.  The design team expects that the lab supply and exhaust will be
VAV, but since this is a Core & Shell design the minimum required flow rates
are unknown.  Also, the potential for resetting air flow rates during
unoccupied hours is unknown.  It is my understanding that baseline and
proposed models will need to assume the same supply and exhaust rates, but
is not clear what those flows should be.  According to Section 6.5.7.2,
buildings with fume hood exhaust rates greater than 15,000 cfm (the building
under consideration) shall include at least one of the following:

 

(a)     VAV Exhaust and Supply capable of minimum flows of 50% or less of
design.

(b)     Will not be met...

(c)     Heat recovery

 

 

What minimum supply and exhaust flow rates do we need to assume?  Do we
assume that the flows are constant (24/7) at the design values?  Or, do we
follow item A listed above? 

 

Any insight into lab Core & Shell makeup/exhaust flow and/or heat recovery
modeling requirement is appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Mickey

I have been working in the eQUEST wizard for the last 2 weeks. Yesterday
I transferred from the wizard to the detailed input. Before I switched
over I saved a copy of the project in the wizard on both my c drive and
my companies server. I then went on in the detailed edit mode to adjust
the model. This morning I can't get into any of my models or back ups.

 

I was planning to use the wizard version to create my baseline building
as required by ASHRAE 90.1. Without access to the pd2 file I can't use
this.

 

I can access the detailed model through the inp file but I really need
to get into the wizard.

 

Any assistance in solving this problem would be gratefully received.

Mickey -

I am not too dialed into the LEED issues you reference.  Much of lab design is not really addressed by LEED.  The folks at Labs21 are working on that.

Addressing the air flow though, here are the issues.

1)  Each lab space must maintain, at a minimum, the owner's specified Air Change per Hour rate.  The owner can select his own value, but Labs21 folks are suggesting 6 ACH in the absence of any compelling reason to do otherwise.

2)  Chemical fume hoods must, at a minimum, exhaust 25 CFM per square foot of fume hood work surface.  If you are using VAV, you will most likely be controlling the hood's face velocity to 100 lineal feet per minute once the minimum is reached.

3)  VAV systems do a great job of minimizing the exhaust volume when the sashes are closed, but rely on the users to do so.  As a rule, they aren't that good at keeping the hoods closed.  You might look at the New Tech Automatic Sash Positioning System to accomplish that.  (www.newtechtm.com)  With ASPS installed, the exhaust volumes should be much less than 50% of max.

By the way, since you will be reducing the demand on the supply and exhaust system, you can also reduce the size of your heating and cooling equipment, and supply and exhaust fans and some of the ductwork. 

I hope this is helpful.

Does both the .INP and .PD2 files still exist? I had a problem sometime
back where I lost the .PD2 file.
 
Send what you have to Scott Criswell (Scott.Criswell at doe2.com), tell him
what version you ran the model in. He got me straightened out.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQUEST crashing



I have been working in the eQUEST wizard for the last 2 weeks. Yesterday
I transferred from the wizard to the detailed input. Before I switched
over I saved a copy of the project in the wizard on both my c drive and
my companies server. I then went on in the detailed edit mode to adjust
the model. This morning I can't get into any of my models or back ups.

 

I was planning to use the wizard version to create my baseline building
as required by ASHRAE 90.1. Without access to the pd2 file I can't use
this.

 

I can access the detailed model through the inp file but I really need
to get into the wizard.

 

Any assistance in solving this problem would be gratefully received.

Karen,
 Yes, we have. We used CONTAM, which is a bulk air flow modeling tool 
available from NIST (www.nist.gov) coupled with TRNSYS . TRNSYS did the 
thermal model and CONTAM did the interzonal air flows. If your building 
model is a single zone, however, I don't think CONTAM or other bulk air 
flow models (such as COMIS) will be appropriate, however. Bulk air flow 
models define pressure nodes (much like the thermal zones of a building) 
and predict air flow between those nodes based on the resistance offered 
by gaps around doors, the porosity of building materials, joints between 
walls, window frames, operable windows, etc.). If you are just dealing 
with one large space then the internal resistance to air flow is quite 
low and you would probably need to use a CFD tool such as Fluent to get 
at it.
Kind regards,
 David

Message-ID: <66f63cae0803200833k3a0b9f99k8a42ed1adcfe4a6a@mail.gmail.com>

Dear folks,

APP G3.1.3.7 specifies centrifugal chillers in baseline models where
conditioned area is greater than 22,296 m2. I always take them as
water-cooled chillers by default.

Today one of my clients challenged why air-cooled centrifugal chillers can't
be modeled in the baseline. His argument is that there is not any
"water-cooled" explicitly specified in G3.1.3.7, but there are air-cooled
centrifugal chillers available in the market.

I was attemping to convince him of my understanding by searching
ASHRAE 90.1and the associated user manual. But I failed to find any
evidence. I doubted
if I was wrong.

Is there anyone in this forum who can give me an answer? And if I am still
right, how can I convince my client who is hungry for points of EA cr1?

Tons of thanks in advance.

Jessi

Jessi,

You are correct, all chillers modeled in the baseline building per Appendix G are water cooled. See G3.1.3.11 Heat Rejection (Systems 7 and 8), which states "The heat rejection device shall be an axial fan cooling tower with two speed fans...". 

Since this issue was confusing to others as well as your client, it was clarified in the 2007 version of Appendix G, and now specifically adds "Water-Cooled" to the chiller type in the table.

"water-cooled" explicitly specified in G3.1.3.7, but there are air-cooled
centrifugal chillers available in the market.

I was attemping to convince him of my understanding by searching
ASHRAE 90.1and the associated user manual. But I failed to find any
evidence. I doubted
if I was wrong.

Is there anyone in this forum who can give me an answer? And if I am still
right, how can I convince my client who is hungry for points of EA cr1?

Tons of thanks in advance.

Jessi

Hi,
I am trying to model the effects of changing static pressure on fan energy
use. I notice that when I change the static pressure across a fan, it
resizes the fan. Alternatively e quest (in the detailed data edit mode) does
not let me input a constant kW/cfm value to define a fan.

Message-ID: <47E2AAA5.2060205@wichert.org>

I am modeling a water loop heat pump system for a California 
installation and in trying to get the E-Quest Compliance part to run, 
E-Quest is asking for "Heat Pump Configuration" and states that the 
default is "zero".  The DOE-2 documentation in Volume 5, Compliance 
Analysis, states that the variable is C-HP-CONFIG and the options are:

TYPE = ALL OTHERS
0 - Single Package
1 - Split System

TYPE = PTAC
2 - Pkg Terminal Heat Pump
3 - Room HP with louvered sides
4 - Room HP w/o louvered sides

No matter what System Type I put in, the screen does not appear to 
accept an entry, but it will accept a "default" from the "Required 
Inputs" screen.  I believe that this enters a "zero" which would be 
"Single Package".  It would seem to me that "Pkg Terminal Heat Pump" 
would be more accurate, but I can't seem to get it to allow me to input 
a "2".

I have a feeling that this is one of those "must use manual entries" 
issues, but I have never done that and I am not anxious to try it.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Sincerely,


Robert Wichert

Equest3.6 Outside Air System with Demand Control Ventilation - ReportsHello, colleagues:

I met a question durning use Equest modeling for LEED certification.

There exist a big workshop, no existing internal wall inside.  And this workshop was equipped with many AHUs. 

I recognized this big workshop as one HVAC zone, and I appoint The air side system of this zone as Multi-zone in Equest 3.61.

Am i right, If not ,what should i do for this problem.

Any advices for it will be very appreciated.

For EAC1, the comparison is about energy cost.  The ice storage will save money IF you have time-of-day electricity rates in place.  If you are using the EIA state average rate data, it won't show a savings.
 
Ice storage actually uses more energy not less -- you can get more out of the ice, but remember that you have to spend the same amount of refrigeration energy to make the ice, plus the chiller will be working against unfavorable temperatures and fluid properties which will use more compressor energy compared to conventional chilled water, per ton-hr.
 
Maybe there is merit if you can say what savings there are from night-time electricity compared to day-time electricity, or if there is some major problem with electricity distribution in your area.
 
Your client may be interested in first cost savings if you design a partial storage system, but don't expect any LEED credit for that.
 
David

Dear folks,

I am always confused which report I shall use to count unmet load hours. The
under-cooled or heated hours to  be summed in the SS-R is different from
PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE to be
multiplied by 8760 hours.

Please advise which numerb I shall use to fill in the LEED EA Cr1 template.

Leed give credit for energy cost saving. So my guess is that if you can 
save energy cost with ice storage system with the right tariff, then you 
should get some advantage with leed with the use of ice storage system.

Agree with everything David pointed out. While ice making chillers would use more energy to create the colder temperatures needed for phase change, they often do this at night when cooling tower doesn't work as hard and ambients drop (in some climates) so net energy is often less. In other words, the kWh consumption can be less as well as peak kW savings under rate tarriff considerations.

Greetings,

I am trying to run my baseline simulation as apart of ASHRAE 90.1 by
running all four exposures and taking averages of them.  I heard that
running a parametric run is the best solution for this, and if it is can
someone tell me the procedure of doing.  To provide some help I have
created parametric runs in the parametric runs windows based on the
North, South, East, and West azimuths, and now I need to find how to
actually start the simulation based on this.  Thanks!

BTW, for ease of use I like to name them as 090, 180, 270 in the
parametric names, rather than 1, 2, 3.

 

Anyway, when you click on the button to simulate, it should bring up
your baseline plus any parametric alternatives.  Just check the boxes of
all that you want to simulate at the time.

Greetings,

I am trying to run my baseline simulation as apart of ASHRAE 90.1 by
running all four exposures and taking averages of them.  I heard that
running a parametric run is the best solution for this, and if it is can
someone tell me the procedure of doing.  To provide some help I have
created parametric runs in the parametric runs windows based on the
North, South, East, and West azimuths, and now I need to find how to
actually start the simulation based on this.  Thanks!

I am not sure where in the program, equest, where you can manually enter

Hello Everyone,

I recently constructed my building in eQuest and with it, one of the things
I would like to do is figure out how much energy is used when abiding by the
criteria of LEED EQ credit 3.2.  14,000 cubic feet of outside air must be
provided while maintaining the building at 60 degrees F and RH of no higher
than 60%.  The systems would be on for 3-4 days and I was thinking of
simulating it during the spring sometime.  Does anyone have any ideas to go
about this? Thank you for your help.

Message-ID: <000001c88e8c$42824b60$c786e220$@com>

I am modeling a slab-on-grade floor using the methods described under the
help for the U-EFF.  This is the described in the Volume 3: Topics/ Envelope
Components / Underground Wall eQuest 3.61e help files.  A sample calculation
is presented for the 100 ft x 50 ft slab-on-grade floor.  The sample input
is given as follows;

LAY-SLAB-1 = LAYERS
     MATERIAL           = ("Soil 12in","Conc HW 140lb 4in (CC03)")
     INSIDE-FILM-RES    = 0.77 ..

CON-SLAB-1 = CONSTRUCTION
     TYPE               = LAYERS
     LAYERS             = LAY-SLAB-1 ..

SLAB-1 = UNDERGROUND-FLOOR
     HEIGHT             = 50
     WIDTH              = 100
     TILT               = 180
     PERIM-EXPOSED      = 300
     PERIM-CONDCUT      = 0.50
     CONSTRUCTION       = CON-SLAB-1 ..

eQuest 3.61e does not appear to accept the PERIM-CONDUCT and PERIM-EXPOSED
keywords as input.  Instead it uses the keyword U-EFF.

In Vol 23, No.6 of the Building Energy Simulation User News for DOE2.1E,
slab-on-grade calculations were presented using the following;

Reff = A/(F2 x Pexp) where Reff = Reffective, A = area of slab (ft), F2 =
perimeter conduction factor, and Pexp = exposed perimeter length (ft).

So, is U-EFF required in eQuest 3.61e calculated as U-EFF = 1/Reff = (F2 x
Pexp)/Area using F2 factors from Table 9?

Or, is there a way that I should be entering PERIM-EXPOSED and PERIM-CONDUCT
for each floor?

Thanks in advance for any help clearing this up for me.

On the "Project & Site" tab, under "Simulation Options" where it says
"Entire Year" you can set the start and end dates of your simulation.  The
default is Jan 1 to Dec 31.  If you are going to simulate less than a 12
month period I suggest you also specify heating and cooling design days for
equipment sizing.  If you don't use design days I believe equest will
autosize based on the 3-4 day simulation period you specify.

You can include them as fixed shades or building shades. (see project 
tab) The advantage is they will shade more than 1 window whereas a 
window shade will only shade that window regardless of how long it is.

Consider a building with an air handler with a 54F supply temperature, and a
45F entering CHW temperature.  If the fan is draw through, and the fan heat
is 4F, then the temperature leaving the cooling coil must be 50F in order to
produce 54F downstream of the fan.  But 50F - 45F = 5F, which is a delta too
low for the coil curves to handle.  

 

To resolve, either raise your SYSTEM:MIN-SUPPLY-T, or lower the
CIRCULATION-LOOP:DESIGN-COOL-T

 

A version of the program currently in development will better resolve this
issue, but is not expected to be ready until late in the year.

When constructing the baseline energy model, Appendix

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Central plant modeling/software question
Message-ID: <001601c88ea1$89e6eaf0$0200a8c0@vlynne>

Hello - We have an interesting modeling situation coming up: a complex of
buildings on a central heating plant, though actually there are 2 central
plants - one old steam plant and one newer plant.  We'll be modeling one
building in detail (using eQuest) and 2 other buildings in less detail
(maybe only an UA).  

 

Among other issues we need to analyze these options for the 3 buildings: 1)
stay on the old central plant, 2) shift to the new plant, 3) install stand
alone boilers in the individual buildings.  This is complicated by the fact
that one of the plants has geothermal preheating.  

 

My question is this: I suspect that eQuest may not be the best choice for
analyzing the central plant options - is there a (not very expensive) piece
of software out there somewhere that would help us in this analysis?  I've
visited the DOE site that lists 345 software tools and didn't find anything
(though with that many choices I could have easily missed something)

 

Any suggestions are gratefully appreciated.

 

v.

cooling tower in consideration during the simulation?  Thank you very

Hello all,

 

ASHRAE Appendix G requires an air side economizer with a high limit shut
off of 75 F for some climate zones base cases.  Typically  on projects I
have specified these type of economizers with a 65 F high limit shut off
and to have the compressor locked out during the economizer cycle.  Does
ASHRAE require the compressors to be locked out with a 75 F high limit
shutoff or can I have the compressor running during the economizer
cycle?  I have not found anywhere in 90.1 that requires the compressor
to be locked out, but am I overlooking it?

 

Thanks for all your help!

Appendix G states the baseline model "does not shade itself", this simply
means that the envelope of the baseline model should have surface shading
turned off.  You should have surface shading turned on for the proposed
model.

You need to be in the Detailed Edit mode to add individual loops and
cooling towers to individual chillers. In Detailed Edit Mode, go to the
Component Tree on the LH side, go to Water Side Tab on the top of the
screen. Then go to the Component Tree again on the "project"line above
the "Global Parameters" line, right click, and, behold, you can create
additional components (circulation loops, chillers, cooling towers, etc.
 
THIS is where you can create separate towers for separate chillers.

I was wondering if anyone knows the answer to this question.  I
specified for three chillers and three cooling towers on my energy model
and when I go into the detailed edit mode it shows the three chillers
but it only shows one cooling tower.  I was wondering why this was the

the other advantage of building shades is that they can have a shading
schedule - to allow for variations in vegetation density throughout the

You can include them as fixed shades or building shades. (see project
tab) The advantage is they will shade more than 1 window whereas a
window shade will only shade that window regardless of how long it is.

Myrene,
 
You could consider any shading provided by the balconies as building self-shading, which isn't allowed in the Baseline and is allowed for the Proposed Design.  Whether you call them shading projections or call their shading self-shading, I think they are not allowed in the Baseline and are in the Proposed.  Let me know if anybody disagrees!

Message-ID: <1901717528DF6E4EA2EEB294C11E7850422335@MULTIORG1.cgnetmo.org>

Bill makes a good point about taking advantage of the lower temperature
of the ice system. I worked on a project that had an ice storage system
that took advantage of the colder temperature. We made the chilled water
supply temperature 38F and return temperature 62F (DeltaT=24F). The
pumping power saved was pretty significant, since the chilled water had
to be pumped underground more than 1200 feet from the Chiller Plant to
the main building. The lower chilled water temperature allowed me to use
lower supply air temperature at the air handlers, which allowed me to
select smaller air handlers (due to lower cfm), which allowed me to
actually fit the air handlers into the allotted space! So there are more
benefits than just energy cost benefits...if you take advantage of the
opportunities.

I doubt that night-time wet bulb depression is sufficient in most places
to compensate for the difference between saturated evaporating
temperatures associated with typical chilled water and ice production
systems.  However, break-even seems to be attainable for air-cooled
systems.

Variable speed compressors and thermal storage are a good match because
VS operation maximized the impact of a lift reduction.

A key to saving energy with ice storage or any other low temperature
production scheme is to take advantage of the low temperature source.
The most common examples are low temperature water distribution and low
temperature air distribution to achieve larger temperature differences
and reduce transport energy consumption.

Other benefits of  thermal storage that are significant, but frequently
poorly quantified, if quantified at all, are load management
effects--more efficient part loading, preferential loading of  more
efficient equipment, etc.

Agree with everything David pointed out. While ice making chillers would
use more energy to create the colder temperatures needed for phase
change, they often do this at night when cooling tower doesn't work as
hard and ambients drop (in some climates) so net energy is often less.
In other words, the kWh consumption can be less as well as peak kW
savings under rate tarriff considerations.

For EAC1, the comparison is about energy cost.  The ice storage will
save money IF you have time-of-day electricity rates in place.  If you
are using the EIA state average rate data, it won't show a savings.

Ice storage actually uses more energy not less -- you can get more out
of the ice, but remember that you have to spend the same amount of
refrigeration energy to make the ice, plus the chiller will be working
against unfavorable temperatures and fluid properties which will use
more compressor energy compared to conventional chilled water, per
ton-hr.

Maybe there is merit if you can say what savings there are from
night-time electricity compared to day-time electricity, or if there is
some major problem with electricity distribution in your area.

Your client may be interested in first cost savings if you design a
partial storage system, but don't expect any LEED credit for that.

Dear colleagues,

I would kindly ask for an information please.
I am thinking of designing an ice storage chilling system that would
generate ice at night, during low electricity rates, and will be used
during the following day for to reduce peak cooling demands of the
building.

Could I get LEED credits in Energy and Atmosphere section for reducing
the cooling cost?

In addition, taking into account that ice can absorb more heat than that
of water and therefore will lead to much more chilling capaciity or
"tons" of refrigeration from the same size/horsepower rating of
compressors than a conventional type of chiller.
I gues I could get more LEED credits for being environmentally friendly?

Please advise.
Thanks muchly.

Regards Sasa Pantic

July,

 

"Multi-zone" is a type of AHU. It does not mean that there are multiple
AHUs serving the same space. A multizone air handler separates the air
in the unit and blows some air across a cooling coil and the rest of the
air blows across a heating coil. Dampers at the end of the AHU then mix
some of the hot air with some of the cold air to get the mixed air
temperature needed to meet the load in the space for each of the zones.
If the air handlers are like this, then your air system selection is
correct. I would not expect a multi-zone air handler to be used in a big
open space. They are used where there are different thermal zones that
need to be served by the same system. I suspect that the air handlers in
your building are constant volume, single zone, instead of multi-zone.
Hope this helps.

Exterior lighting is easily handled as a base load. Here's how:

 

1.      Go to Create Plants

2.      Click on the Base Utility/Misc. Accessory Tab

3.      In the Base utility section of that window, choose parking lot
lighting from the drop down menu.

4.      You can enter a description, specific the peak kW load, and
assign a schedule for the lighting. Use the Schedule Library to create a
unique schedule, as needed.

5.      If you want to call it something other than "parking lot
lights", just create a new base utility in the library. 

 

In the equipment report, the parking lot lighting will be a separate
line item so you can track the changes of various design options (or
design vs. minimum compliance).

 

Personal regards,

One thing to be careful of when considering the impact of low temperature
air distribution on energy use:  Depending on climate, many hours of
economizer cooling may be lost.  This can be a huge impact in mild climates,
and should be evaluated in all climates that have moderate temperatures for
at least a few months a year.  The increased plant energy use from the loss
of "free" cooling can dwarf the air transport savings, unless this is
accounted for in the design and control of the air systems.

Bill makes a good point about taking advantage of the lower temperature of
the ice system. I worked on a project that had an ice storage system that
took advantage of the colder temperature. We made the chilled water supply
temperature 38F and return temperature 62F (DeltaT=24F). The pumping power
saved was pretty significant, since the chilled water had to be pumped
underground more than 1200 feet from the Chiller Plant to the main building.
The lower chilled water temperature allowed me to use lower supply air
temperature at the air handlers, which allowed me to select smaller air
handlers (due to lower cfm), which allowed me to actually fit the air
handlers into the allotted space! So there are more benefits than just
energy cost benefits.if you take advantage of the opportunities.

I doubt that night-time wet bulb depression is sufficient in most places to
compensate for the difference between saturated evaporating temperatures
associated with typical chilled water and ice production systems.  However,
break-even seems to be attainable for air-cooled systems.

Variable speed compressors and thermal storage are a good match because VS
operation maximized the impact of a lift reduction.

A key to saving energy with ice storage or any other low temperature
production scheme is to take advantage of the low temperature source.  The
most common examples are low temperature water distribution and low
temperature air distribution to achieve larger temperature differences and
reduce transport energy consumption.

Other benefits of  thermal storage that are significant, but frequently
poorly quantified, if quantified at all, are load management effects--more
efficient part loading, preferential loading of  more efficient equipment,
etc.

Agree with everything David pointed out. While ice making chillers would use
more energy to create the colder temperatures needed for phase change, they
often do this at night when cooling tower doesn't work as hard and ambients
drop (in some climates) so net energy is often less. In other words, the kWh
consumption can be less as well as peak kW savings under rate tarriff
considerations.

For EAC1, the comparison is about energy cost.  The ice storage will save
money IF you have time-of-day electricity rates in place.  If you are using
the EIA state average rate data, it won't show a savings.

Ice storage actually uses more energy not less -- you can get more out of
the ice, but remember that you have to spend the same amount of
refrigeration energy to make the ice, plus the chiller will be working
against unfavorable temperatures and fluid properties which will use more
compressor energy compared to conventional chilled water, per ton-hr.

Maybe there is merit if you can say what savings there are from night-time
electricity compared to day-time electricity, or if there is some major
problem with electricity distribution in your area.

Your client may be interested in first cost savings if you design a partial
storage system, but don't expect any LEED credit for that.

Dear colleagues,

I would kindly ask for an information please.
I am thinking of designing an ice storage chilling system that would
generate ice at night, during low electricity rates, and will be used during
the following day for to reduce peak cooling demands of the building.

Could I get LEED credits in Energy and Atmosphere section for reducing the
cooling cost?

In addition, taking into account that ice can absorb more heat than that of
water and therefore will lead to much more chilling capaciity or "tons" of
refrigeration from the same size/horsepower rating of compressors than a
conventional type of chiller.
I gues I could get more LEED credits for being environmentally friendly?

Please advise.
Thanks muchly.

Regards Sasa Pantic

Hello,

 

 

I have been a VE user for about 6 months. I found it very interesting
specially for creating 3D models, SunCast, Load Calculation .etc  

Now I'm trying to run simulations for a design case and a baseline case
according to ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G as required by LEED EAc1. 

 

I summarized Appendix G in terms of Envelope, HVAC System, Service Hot Water
System .etc and finally I got a pretty good idea 

about what is needed to create a baseline and a design case (Walls, Windows,
Equipment efficiency, Equipment Capacities, sizes .etc). 

 

The problem that I'm having is that I found limited input entries in IES<VE>
to describe what  ASHRAE requires to simulate the building. For example the
water side is 

Very limited and controls are not very user-friendly. 

 

Was anyone successful with IES<VE> to work on LEED EAc1 / ASHRAE 90.1-2004
Appendix G? And if the answer is yes how did you go about documenting the
results?

 

Thanks to all the participants on this mailing list for their support and
good luck.

Hello,

 

I know that I have to enter the detailed design interface in eQuest to
model a flat, one way sloped roof.  However, when I specify a tilt
angle, the roof plane doesn't rotate around the axis that I want it to
with respect to the outward normal.  It seems like there should be three
different rotation angles - one about each orthogonal axis - to cover
all of the degrees of freedom, but there are only two.  Is there any way
around this?  Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

Brett,

 

My understanding is that the PERIM-CONDUCT and PERIM-EXPOSED keywords
are not yet implemented in the DOE-2.2 engine (used by eQuest). The
U-EFFECTIVE keyword, taken from the DOE-2.1E engine, is no longer used
in DOE-2.2 (but for some reason the program doesn't complain when you
try to use it - instead it just ignores any input for this keyword).
This doesn't seem to leave much for us to work with. *Does anybody know
if eQuest does something other than specifying the U-EFFECTIVE keyword
when it asks for a U-eff input for underground surfaces? 

 

The concept for all of these keywords comes from a paper released by
Fred Winkelmann in Building Simulation User News Vol. 23, No. 6
(http://gundog.lbl.gov/dirun/23n_d_1.pdf). The article suggests creating
a fictitious resistance layer in the wall to create the correct overall
U-value for the foundation configuration. Using the U-EFFECTIVE keyword
in addition to specifying this fictitious layer seems redundant, and you
should be able to get the same results without specifying it.

 

My suggestion would be to specify the fictitious layer in detailed edit
mode. That is of course if eQuest isn't already doing something behind
the scenes to calculate this layer.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest: Slab on Grade Ueff Calculation (Underground
Wall)

 

I am modeling a slab-on-grade floor using the methods described under
the help for the U-EFF.  This is the described in the Volume 3: Topics/
Envelope Components / Underground Wall eQuest 3.61e help files.  A
sample calculation is presented for the 100 ft x 50 ft slab-on-grade
floor.  The sample input is given as follows;

LAY-SLAB-1 = LAYERS
     MATERIAL           = ("Soil 12in","Conc HW 140lb 4in (CC03)")
     INSIDE-FILM-RES    = 0.77 ..

CON-SLAB-1 = CONSTRUCTION
     TYPE               = LAYERS
     LAYERS             = LAY-SLAB-1 ..

SLAB-1 = UNDERGROUND-FLOOR
     HEIGHT             = 50
     WIDTH              = 100
     TILT               = 180
     PERIM-EXPOSED      = 300
     PERIM-CONDCUT      = 0.50
     CONSTRUCTION       = CON-SLAB-1 ..

eQuest 3.61e does not appear to accept the PERIM-CONDUCT and
PERIM-EXPOSED keywords as input.  Instead it uses the keyword U-EFF.

In Vol 23, No.6 of the Building Energy Simulation User News for DOE2.1E,
slab-on-grade calculations were presented using the following;

Reff = A/(F2 x Pexp) where Reff = Reffective, A = area of slab (ft), F2
= perimeter conduction factor, and Pexp = exposed perimeter length (ft).

So, is U-EFF required in eQuest 3.61e calculated as U-EFF = 1/Reff = (F2
x Pexp)/Area using F2 factors from Table 9?

Or, is there a way that I should be entering PERIM-EXPOSED and
PERIM-CONDUCT for each floor?

Thanks in advance for any help clearing this up for me.

Dear all,

The project is a mixed use building with offices and a hotel. The system is
VAV  with chillers and cooling towers. The hotel rooms use fan coil units.

In eQUEST, after the condenser water loop is utilized for a water side
economizer loop for the office floors, the space cooling in the BEPS report
shows up as zero. Any ideas on what's going wrong? Any suggestions on
troubleshooting the issue are appreciated.

Thanks,

Thank you all for your responses.  I am having trouble finding the fixed

Help but not the eQuest Help files.  Is it possible to have trees as

Also, when I click on the 'Project & Site' tab, the screen says "no

Dear all,

 

I have a question for you about e-Quest. I have a typical floor in a high
rise that I'm trying to simulate according to ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G for
LEED EAc1. The floor area is about 1200 m2 or 12916 ft2 the system applied
in the design case is Fan Coil units for the different zones + DOAU for the
fresh air. The system applied in the baseline case is system 7 (VAV with
reheat).

 

My question is how long do you think it will take for someone without very
much experience with e-Quest but with some simulation experience with other
tools to run the simulation with e-Quest. Thank you very much and hope to
hear from you soon.

 

 


Best regards,

Hi Anis,

Could you specify where exactly you are stuck with IES VE? We have done
the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G using it.

Hello,

 

 

I have been a VE user for about 6 months. I found it very interesting
specially for creating 3D models, SunCast, Load Calculation ...etc  

Now I'm trying to run simulations for a design case and a baseline case
according to ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G as required by LEED EAc1. 

 

I summarized Appendix G in terms of Envelope, HVAC System, Service Hot
Water System ...etc and finally I got a pretty good idea 

about what is needed to create a baseline and a design case (Walls,
Windows, Equipment efficiency, Equipment Capacities, sizes ...etc). 

 

The problem that I'm having is that I found limited input entries in
IES<VE> to describe what  ASHRAE requires to simulate the building. For
example the water side is 

Very limited and controls are not very user-friendly. 

 

Was anyone successful with IES<VE> to work on LEED EAc1 / ASHRAE
90.1-2004 Appendix G? And if the answer is yes how did you go about
documenting the results?

 

Thanks to all the participants on this mailing list for their support
and good luck. 

 

 


Best regards,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Residential ERV in Equest
Message-ID: <47F02166.3010502@sustainablybuilt.com>

I'm looking for help in how to correctly specify an ERV for a 
residential application. Unfortunately, the two available HVAC systems 
in Equest for residential do not support an ERV. I'm afraid if I choose 
any of the other commercial based systems that the fan loads, internal 
gains and the rest will be very inaccurate.

Does anyone have much experience with modeling HVAC systems for 
residential buildings? Even more tricky is that I'm doing this on a 
single family home, not multifamily, which seems to be all that Equest 
can really support.

Please cc a reply to my email address as well: adam at sustainablybuilt.com

Thanks for any advice!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED-ASHRAE 90.1-App G - Fan Power calc
Message-ID: <323165.39646.qm@web45113.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

All,
Can anyone please confirm/clarify how the fan power calc should be performed for the baseline model for ASHRAE 90.1- App G (with addendum ac).
 
I have an air handling system that contains a supply fan, a return fan, and a room exhaust fan.  Article G3.1.2.8 states:...."if return or relief fans are specified in the proposed design, the baseline building design shall also be modeled with fans serving the same functions...." and it goes on to specify how those return and relief fans should be sized.
 
My question is:
When determining the baseline fan power, do I only get to perform the calculation once based on the supply air cfm (plus adjustments per addendum ac for each applicable SA, RA and EA component)?  And then that equals my total fan KW allowed for all the fans in the system?  If this is the case, would that total fan KW then be spread across the 3 fans in a prorated fashion?
 
Or, do I get to perform the calc 3 times: once for the supply fan, once for the return fan, and once for the exhaust fan....(each calc including their respective adjustments allowed for for that fan).
 
Obviously, I'm hoping the answer is the latter since the other (single calc) method yields a puny total horsepower number.
 
Your feedback and experience regarding successful applications for LEED submittals in this regard is appreciated.
Julia

Hello Andrew,

I am not sure if building shades can be created from the wizard mode. 
However, they can be created from the detailed mode. From the building 
shell module, right-click on the 'Building Shades' folder and select 
create building shade. There  are further  instructions in the DOE 2 help 
file, just search 'building shades.'

Regards,

Eddie

[Bldg-sim] Shades in eQuest or DOE-2?






Thank you all for your responses.  I am having trouble finding the fixed 
shades and building shades in eQuest.  I noticed the shades are in the 
DOE-2 Help but not the eQuest Help files.  Is it possible to have trees as 
building shades or fixed shades in eQuest?  Could I be missing a plug-in? 
Also, when I click on the ?Project & Site? tab, the screen says ?no 
spreadsheet currently defined?.  I am obviously missing a step as far as 
implementing these building shades.  Any ideas?
 
Thanks everybody.
 
Andrew

Message-ID: <59dad9d9fb8f4a4587b4f1eeaa2b58ae@staff-mail.lboro.ac.uk>

Dear All,

 

We have four new posts available at Loughborough University (UK), in the field of "Building Performance Modelling"; one each at the grades of Professor, Reader, Senior Lecturer, and Lecturer. The four posts are part of a University wide initiative to address the reduction of carbon emissions and the mitigation of anthropogenic climate change - more information on the background to the posts and a link to the job descriptions can be found below.

 

For cross-reference, the post of UK Professor is equivalent to a full US Professor, a "Reader/Senior Lecturer" is equivalent to a US Associate Professor, and a "Lecturer" a US Assistant Professor. Note, however, that all posts have the same "conditions of service" (the issue of "tenure" does not apply to academic posts in the UK).

LOUGHBOROUGH UNIVERSITY 

 

Lead the way in energy and climate change - An outstanding opportunity to meet the greatest challenge of the 21st century

 

Loughborough University is a world-class centre for research into energy and climate change. It has a strategic commitment to supporting the UK's energy and climate change goals with particular emphasis on advancing the deployment of new low-carbon energy technologies, including the efficient generation and use of energy.

 

In September 2007, the Midlands Consortium, comprising the Universities of Birmingham, Loughborough and Nottingham was selected to host the ?1bn national Energy Technologies Institute with its hub based at the heart of Loughborough's Science and Enterprise Park. To capitalise on this, we are now making a major investment in new academic posts, building on an already enviable position in an area regarded by many as the greatest challenge for the 21st century.

 

Over the last 15 years, the Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology (CREST) has become the pre-eminent centre for research in Renewable Energy in the UK, with particular focus on solar and wind power and power distribution systems. With this foundation, our strategic commitment to the energy and climate change agenda was enhanced in 2005 by the formation of our Sustainability Research School, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration between experts across campus in wide-ranging, world-class research activities including Sustainable Design and Manufacture, Sustainable Energy and Transport, Water Supply and Management, Built Environment and Building Performance, Environmental Science and Natural Resource Management, and Sustainable Societies and Economics. From a base in the host academic department and working with the Research School, the successful candidates will significantly enhance our reputation in energy and climate change, and our contribution to meeting the challenge.

Chris,

A DOE-2.1E function was developed to model VRF systems. The VRF function 
works for code compliance type calculations - always meeting the zone 
cooling and heating loads. The VRF function works for heat pump and heat 
recovery type VRF systems. Daikin and Mitsubishi are filing a joint 
application to California Energy Commission to get credits for their VRF 
systems. So far EnergyPro from EnergySoft is the only GUI that 
incorporates the VRF function.

The EnergyPlus development team has a plan to implement the VRF function 
in the next one or two releases.

Julia,

The total allowed fan kW is for all three fans that are part of your system. Appendix G does not really give direction on how to divide up this fan power. If they are all running with the same schedule, then it does not matter. If they are not, I would use a ratio based on the fan power of your three fans in your proposed design.

All,
Can anyone please confirm/clarify how the fan power calc should be performed for the baseline model for ASHRAE 90.1- App G (with addendum ac).

I have an air handling system that contains a supply fan, a return fan, and a room exhaust fan.  Article G3.1.2.8 states:...."if return or relief fans are specified in the proposed design, the baseline building design shall also be modeled with fans serving the same functions...." and it goes on to specify how those return and relief fans should be sized.

My question is:
When determining the baseline fan power, do I only get to perform the calculation once based on the supply air cfm (plus adjustments per addendum ac for each applicable SA, RA and EA component)?  And then that equals my total fan KW allowed for all the fans in the system?  If this is the case, would that total fan KW then be spread across the 3 fans in a prorated fashion?

Or, do I get to perform the calc 3 times: once for the supply fan, once for the return fan, and once for the exhaust fan....(each calc including their respective adjustments allowed for for that fan).

Obviously, I'm hoping the answer is the latter since the other (single calc) method yields a puny total horsepower number.

Your feedback and experience regarding successful applications for LEED submittals in this regard is appreciated.
Julia

Message-ID: <000601c89356$d6012950$6e00000a@mcw.com>

I am attempting to model a Multi-Level space like atrium with eQuest. In the
eQuest DD Wizard (zone names and characteristics), it is possible to define
the zone as it is "open to below". However, if we delete the ceiling of the
first floor in the detailed mode, the results will be different from the
previous scenario. I was wondering which one of these two is the correct
method of modeling the Multi-Level spaces.
 
Thanks,

Hello,

I am modeling a building with several Utility and Sub-Meters. I have a
Chilled Water Meter and Steam Meter attached to the building as well. For
some reason, the PS-B, PS-E reports, report double the sum of the monthly
MBTU or KWH under the column "Total"? I am using the 3.61e version of
eQuest. Has anyone seen this before?

Thanks.

over ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G system 7?

 

I have currently modeled one and I am not sure whether the results I am
getting are accurate or I have done something wrong.

 

Any information would be much appreciated.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Anyone successfully used eQUEST for Federal
	Energy-Efficient Building Tax Deduction?
Message-ID: <533335130803312045l293d5225ud938b782c85f258f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I'm curious if anyone has used an eQUEST model to apply for and receive the
$0.60 to $1.80/sq ft Federal Energy-Efficient Commercial Building Tax
Deduction under Internal Revenue Code ?179D?
The list of qualified software
http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/info/qualified-software/  includes
DOE2.1E and DOE-2.1E-JJH,  but not eQUEST.

Has anyone had an eQUEST-modeled building qualify?
Thanks,
Geert H. Aerts, P.E.
