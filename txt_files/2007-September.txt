Actually a good online resource for sizing, estimating and getting
installers for solar systems is  www.findsolar.com . They have a
property value calculator as well. Hires an excerpt from it:
 
How do you calculate the increase in property value? 

We assume installing solar energy systems will increase the value of
your property. In many states this increase in value is exempt from
property tax. 

How much your property appreciates depends upon many factors. For our
calculations we have assumed the value of your property will increase
by:

*	Solar Electric (PV): Twenty times (20x) your 1st-year utility
savings. (So Brian this matches your estimate) 
*	Solar Thermal (water, pool, spa): Fifteen times (15x) your
first-year utility savings.

Actual situations will vary.

Annual savings from a solar system should appreciate for the first 10-15
years for PV (about 10 years for solar thermal), in line with utility
rate inflation. After that, the savings may start to diminish as the
solar system nears its end of life.

Here's another paper they reference:

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] property values and solar energy



Anyone have information on property value increases for including/adding
solar energy (photovoltaics, and or hot water) to residential and/or
commercial buildings.

 

There is a reference out there to the Appraisal Journal saying 1$
reduction in utility bills equals $20 in increased property values.  But
this is for conventional conservation improvements for residential.
Does it apply to solar energy generation?

John wrote on a toasted coconut shell with an electric tattoo needle;

I believe this is akin to the "swimming pool situation" with residential 
housing.
If the buyer wants a swimming pool it increases the value, and an 
outstanding swimming
pool could  seal the deal on a sale.  On the other hand a person who was 
not looking for a
swimming pool could consider the pool a detriment, just extra 
maintenance costs.

A  PV installation, although not nearly as economically beneficial as an 
active closed loop hot
water system; has no moving parts and takes almost no maintenance.  An 
active closed loop
system can require significant operator skill and day to day involvement 
to wring out all the
energy available. That's why Westwind calls it "Solar Sailing"  it's 
very much like sailing a
small boat in light  variable winds......

In our east coast mid-Atlantic region most solar systems are lost when 
the second owner needs a
new roof.  They just duck the extra expense and lack of repair trade 
skill with the new roof.....
PV increases value flat out even if some of the increase is Politically 
Correct desirability.
Active Solar is a swimming pool.  Wanna get your toes wet?

ESP-r TRAINING SESSION
Concordia University, Montreal
November 21-23, 2007

In conjunction with the NSERC Solar Buildings Research Network, Natural
Resources Canada is offering a free ESP-r training session at Concordia
University in Montreal. The session will include a one-day introductory
course, as well as four half-day advanced modules that focus on
modelling solar energy systems in ESP-r.
 
REGISTRATION
To register, please email Lyne Dee (lynedee at solarbuildings.ca) NO LATER
THAN OCTOBER 5th. Also indicate which modules you wish to attend.

EQUIPMENT
Please bring your own laptop; the necessary software will be provided. A
limited number of spare computers will also be available at the course.
If you require one, please inform Lyne Dee when registering.

INTRODUCTORY COURSE
November 22, 9:00am -- 4:00 pm
 
The introductory course is intended for users new to ESP-r. Over this
one-day session, students will learn basic ESP-r concepts, including
model
creation, simulation and results analysis.  Topics include:
 
* Defining geometry
* Creating opaque envelope components
* Creating windows
* Applying boundary conditions
* Imposing air flows and internal gains
* Modelling plant and controls ideally
* Performing simulations
* Analyzing results
* Adding an air-flow network
 
ADVANCED ESP-r MODULES
November 22-23.
 
Four half-day advanced modules are being offered. Completion of an
introductory ESP-r course is a recommended prerequisite for these
modules.
 
Plant modelling in ESP-r
November 22, 8:00--11:30am
-------------------------------------
This half-day session will introduce ESP-r's advanced mechanical plant
modelling environment. During this session, students will construct a
plant
network and associated controls for a solar hot water heating system in
a
Canadian residence.
 
Electrical network modelling in ESP-r
November 22, 1:00--4:30pm 
-------------------------------------
This half-day session will introduce ESP-r's power-flow modelling
environment. During this session, students will construct a PV network
with
grid connection and electrical storage. Students will also couple plant 
component models such as pumps and fans to the electrical network; for
this
reason the "Plant modelling in ESP-r" module is a suggested
prerequisite.
 
Working with ESP-r source code
November 23, 8:00--11:30am
-------------------------------------
This half-day session will introduce ESP-r development practices.
Students
will learn how to use the Subversion version control system to access
ESP-r
source code, manage their modifications and contribute their changes to
the
community. Recommended development practices will be discussed, and
starting-points for creating new ESP-r models and capabilities
identified.

Using TRNSYS components with ESP-r
November 23, 1:00--4:30pm
-------------------------------------
During this half-day session, students will learn how to couple TRNSYS
plant 
component models to ESP-r. The "Working with ESP-r source code" module
is 
a suggested prerequisite.

Hello All,

 

I am wondering if there is an option in eQuest to choose an oil fired
furnace?  I didn't see one which is why I'm asking.  Any idea on how to
get this resolved?

 

Thank you,

Thanks, Kendra & Rohini

The input summary list for the EA Cr1 example that Rohini refers to does
include separate lines for tradable and non-tradable exterior surfaces.
In the non-tradable row, the kW is same for baseline and proposed.

I have taken credit for exterior lighting savings in the past, and it
was never challenged.  I believe the non-tradable surfaces statement in
Chapter 6 only applies when you are complying with 90.1-2004 via the
prescriptive method.  Any time you move to the performance method, you
can trade off your exterior lighting with other things such as
mechanical and interior lighting.  For LEED energy modeling, your design
must meet all mandatory requirements of 90.1-2004, but not all
prescriptive requirements.

 

The way I have approached this in the past was to calculate allowed
exterior power for each type of exterior lighting (based on the areas
being lit in the Proposed design) and sum the total kW + 5% (Section
9.4.5 of 90.1-2004).  Then, I modeled the actual kW in the Proposed
design.

 

Again, I have never been challenged on this, but I am not certain that
this is the correct approach.

I'm confused as to whether any exterior lighting power can differ
between the proposed & baseline models. Any one have any experience from
EA Cr1 submissions? 

 

The Users Manual for App G states at the end of the "Baseline Lighting"
Section, ".... credit may be taken for improvements in exterior lighting
efficacy or wattage... the proposed building can take credit for a more
efficient system." So proposed parking lot lighting at 0.08 W/sf or
whatever would be compared to a baseline of parking lot lighting at 0.15
W/sf. I believe fa?ade lighting must be the same in both, as these are
"non-tradable surfaces" in Chapter Six. 

 

But an apparently poorly-considered Credit Ruling from 4/25/07 simply
states "No. Appendix G does not allow trade-offs for exterior lighting,"
directly contradicting the UM. 

 

Perhaps a post like this should be on the USGBC "engineers"
"member-to-member" forum, but I don't see much traffic there.

Google Groups? Allows one to get digests, view in email format or go to website and submit. Price is right as well. Can be moderated or open to public, search (naturally) and resides on public server.

Personally I could go either way with a separate eQuest forum/list since I don't use eQuest very often (but would like to get to know it better). Perhaps a forum approach with separate sections for various tools/software as well as general simulation questions, LEED inquiries, ASHRAE 90.1 questions, etc. Would be useful and drive the number of "how do I turn it on" questions down.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Loads not met interpretation in ASHRAE 90.1-2004
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200709251614.AA1402812pd80003772976@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709261114.AA1438718pd80003794294@gard.com>

My interpretation is that the unmet load hours are by zone. Otherwise,
as has been pointed out, with large numbers of zones it can get
ridiculous, and with fewer zones one could game the system.

e.g. if you did have over 300 zones (why you would do that to yourself,
I don't know, but it could come up) you would be allocated less than 1
hour per zone, which I cannot believe is the intent of the standard.

In my submittals I report the largest # of unmet hours for the worst
case zone (yes, it takes a little time to go through the report) and
have not had any issues with regards to USGBC review.

The BEPU/BEPS reports are not the best place to look for this info -
SS-R is the place to go. I often include a copy of the SS-R summary in
my submittal.

In DOE2.1E and in DOE2.2/eQuest, you can view the number of unmet loads
hours on a zone-by-zone basis in the SS-F report. This reports the
number of hours that the zone loads were not met broken down by month
and by category (i.e. heating or cooling).

In addition, the BEPU report gives you the total of unmet loads hours as
a percentage for the system simulation and the central plant simulation.
Be aware that the system unmet loads fraction can be misleading as it is
the number of zone loads not met by the system summed over all the
zones.
Therefore, if one zone has unmet loads for 8760 hours then the fraction
will be reported as 100% even if all the other zones have zero unmet
loads. 

With regard to the loads not met by the plant in the BEPU report, if
these occur at the same time as an unmet system load there will be
double counting of loads not met by the simulation.

My own view is that the Appendix G definition of unmet loads unfairly
penalises simulations with large numbers of zones. For example, in a 10
zone simulation, each zone would need to have 30 hours with unmet loads
to reach the 300 hour limit. But in a simulation with 100 zones each
zone would only need 3 hours of unmet loads to reach 300 unmet loads
hours. 

If I were to rewrite the relevant section of Appendix G to correct this
problem I would multiply the number of hours of unmet load for each zone
by that zone's fraction of building floor area. This would normalise the
measurement of unmet loads to the size of the building and the number of
zones in the simulation so that the maximum possible percentage of unmet
loads would be 100%.

You can click on the building level in the left-hand panel explorer when
you are in the air-side module of eQuest, and then go to the summary
tab.  It will summarize the zones and systems that have unmet loads.

(If you have selected a particular air system in the explorer you will
get the summary for only that system rather than all of the systems.)

I haven't experimented enough to know how it calculates the "building
total"
unmet hours...if simultaneous unmet zones/systems count double or not.
It does provide an overall project system unmet hours for you to use.

The temperature and humidity reports are also useful in the full output
-- in the sim viewer program you can scroll through the zones with the
down arrow once you've selected the desired report to spot any irregular
temperatures.  This might be hard to spot that one spurious hour, but it
will help you see if you are getting a lot of unmet hours at a time you
thought the system was supposed to off for example, or if the unmet
hours are at start-up.  Or perhaps there is a zone that has high
temperatures in winter due to a west facing window and the cooling is
off.

Last idea, make sure you have consistent zone setpoint schedules and
zone design heating and cooling temperatures.  Maybe you have changed
the setpoint schedules during the project and not gone back to the
design setpoint to make the corresponding change.

Kristin:

Thanks for your reply. I will forward your response to the list.

If the standards only address sensible load, I'm wondering whether the
Unmet Load Hours is sufficient to evaluate the performance of a HVAC
system, especially in humid climate where indoor humidity control is an
essential part of the HVAC system. Since indoor humidity control may
consume significant energy depending on the equipment/system used, I
think the unmet latent load or the indoor humidity level should also be
accounted for in the building energy performance evaluation to get fair
comparison between proposed and baseline building designs.

Xiaobing,

I tried to send this email to the list, but there's a glitch that
doesn't allow my messages to get through. 
Anyway, here's my response for you at least:

My interpretation is that the standard is addressing sensible load only
and that it is for building-wide hours of load unmet, not by zone.
Anyone disagree?

For eQUEST/DOE-2.2, this would mean that I'd say to use the number on
the BEPS report instead of from the SS-R reports (although those are
very helpful to look at for other reasons).

I like the forum idea also.  A good forum package is sold by 
http://communityserver.org.  This is a commercial package and costs 
$400 - $2000.  There must be open source (free) 
alternatives?  Possibly IBPSA-USA and/or some vendors could kick in 
some $ if there is not a good free choice.

There is the additional question of who would host the forum.  Jason 
probably doesn't want to make a career out of public service for the 
simulation community.

I think you lose a little bit in the forum as under the listserv format
everyone gets your question.  I occasionally will offer a suggestion if
I see something on the listserv.  I don't know that I'd do it as often
with the forum -- I'd be going there more often to ask my own questions.

I could see maybe listserv as-is, and separate eQuest forum.  (Or heck,
most bulletin board software that I've seen could accommodate multiple
software groups and topics for each.)

Certainly wouldn't want to see the bldg-sim go away.

Aleka,

IBPSA-Germany is working on a world-wide simulation Wiki ... Dru just 
distributed the URL for it 
(<http://129.187.44.165/index.php/Simupedia/en>http://129.187.44.165/index.php/Simupedia/en)


I think a forum would serve a different purpose ... quick, informal 
user-user and user-vendor communication.  Some of the forum material 
could get boiled down and added to Simupedia.

Completely not interested in a forum, I can just see everyone with their
avatars and stars and number of posts and forum ranking just emoticoning
away.  Good Grieve Charlie Brown.

You know, it doesn't have to be anything elaborate.  It can be as simple
as a phpbb based message board which is hosted online by whatever
company you sign up with.  I have experience as an administrator on a
few different forums and I can tell you that they are very simple to
maintain and moderate.
I would be very interested in helping with this idea.

I like the forum idea also.  A good forum package is sold by 
http://communityserver.org.  This is a commercial package and costs 
$400 - $2000.  There must be open source (free) 
alternatives?  Possibly IBPSA-USA and/or some vendors could kick in 
some $ if there is not a good free choice.

There is the additional question of who would host the forum.  Jason 
probably doesn't want to make a career out of public service for the 
simulation community.

I think Peter is on to something.  As much as my heart goes out to
eQuest, sometimes it's a bit too much information to weed through.  At
an IBPSA meeting last year some people were talking about creating a
wiki for building simulation, similar to Wikipedia.  Has anyone thought
more about this?  It would make all the information that we're gathering
through this list serve much easier for everyone to access.

I completely agree with you on the idea of a forum.  It would be the
best suited environment to document and categorize various topics while
maintain e-mail alerts and search features. If those maintaining
gard.com require funding or assistance for such an upgrade I imagine
many companies would be willing to make a contribution and possibly even
government and environmental groups if we got the word out. For such a
technologically advanced group of people (forgive me for making a
generalization) we should look into such a platform for this group.

If there is any assistance I could provide, please contact feel free to
contact me.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] An eQUEST mailing list?


I've been listening to both sides of this thread, and I have to say I
kind of agree with both!  Yeah, it does get a little burdensome to get
all of the eQUEST/DOE2-related questions in my mail box because I'm not
a user of those programs.  But sometimes it IS hard to separate the
general modeling questions from the program specific ones.  And it can
be informative to see what the other programs are up to as well.

My proposal is to move BLDG-SIM to a forum format.  There's some
powerful--and widely used--software out there these days for managing
web-based forums.  I think most forum programs offer standard features
like dedicated topics, searching of threads, customizable interface,
etc.  I'm sure most of us have run across this type of web-based forum
before.

To address our specific problems, it seems like it would make sense to
have a dedicated topic for eQUEST on there, as well as topics for
"General Simulation Questions", "LEED", "ASHRAE 90.1", and I'm sure
several others would be appropriate too..."Simulation Interfaces"...who
knows...  Usually the forum software will let you put in hyperlinks to
posts in other threads as well.  So if one post in the "eQUEST" topic is
also relevant in a "General Simulation Questions" thread, someone can
post a hyperlink cross-reference.  

Otherwise, if BLDG-SIM were to not go the forum route, I would vote for
an eQUEST-only mailing list.

To get one message per day that is a digest of all of the 
days emails, send an email to

    mdaemon at gard.com

with a blank subject line and the following line in the body 
of the message:

    DIGEST bldg-sim at gard.com

To stop getting digests and get each message individually 
send the following line to the same address

    NORMAL bldg-sim at gard.com

When you subscribe to the digest, you will get one message 
per day with all of the messages sent that day one after 
another. The subject line will look like:

[BLDG-SIM] BLDG-SIM at GARD.COM message digest 09/26/2007 03:01 
(#2007-1027)

Because of this, when replying to a message, please use the 
subject line from the specific message. The digest subject 
line has no meaning and will not help others.

Also, at times, message formats will not be converted 
properly and a specific digest message will not be readable. 
I cannot fix that problem.

Please let me know if you have any problems with this.

  Dan,

  You can search the BLDG-SIM archives quickly at Google.com by entering the following syntax for your search:

      "key word" site:gard.com

  where "key word" is any string you would likely find in a BLDG-SIM message. For example, you can search for "heat recovery" like this:

      "heat recovery" site:gard.com

  or for DWG drawings, like this

      "DWG"  site:gard.com

I find myself constantly opening and deleting BLDG-Sim emails, all 
day long... Is there a way to collect each day's postings into one 
email like EnergyPlus does... That way there would not have to be 
this split/no-split issue because it would be easy for each of us to 
do a quick sort for whatever topics might be of interest...

You should be able to simply delete the boilers and chillers defined
by the Wizard.  Right clicking on the component tree item should give
you a delete option on the menu.  There may also be pumps, the cooling
tower and the condenser loop to clean up.

The steam meter and chilled water meter provide hot water and chilled
water as required by the building (unless a maximum meter capacity is
defined.  Note that their energy is not shown on all the eQUEST
summary reports.  It is in the detailed .sim output reports.

The documentation from the DOE2.com download area goes into this a bit
-- probably the topics volume.

This is an equest detailed edit mode question.

I have a building that is on campus steam and chilled water.  I have
added a
steam meter and chilled water meter to my building loops.

1) How do I "turn off" the boiler and chiller that are still attached
to
these loops?

2) Is there a good tutorial source on what the inputs on the chilled
water/steam meter screen do?

Thanks in advance.

Your project will be saved to a directory folder (normally c/program
files/eQUEST/projects/**project name**
 
In this folder you will find a *.SIM file for each of the simulations
you run. The SIM file has all your reports. For LEED, the ones you
really need are you BEPS & BEPU reports. 
 
If your wondering what each report tells you, there's a useful download

How do I print input reports for E-Quest?
 
I am using E-quest v3-61 to model a building for submittal of LEED
credit EA 1 Optimize Energy Performance using ASHRAE 90.1 - 2004
Appendix G.  Section G1.4 (c) requires input and output reports to be
included in the submittal.  Other than a print screen of each wizard
page, I am at a loss of what to submit for the input report.  Is there a
method used by anyone which has been submitted and approved by the

I've been listening to both sides of this thread, and I have to say I
kind of agree with both!  Yeah, it does get a little burdensome to get
all of the eQUEST/DOE2-related questions in my mail box because I'm not
a user of those programs.  But sometimes it IS hard to separate the
general modeling questions from the program specific ones.  And it can
be informative to see what the other programs are up to as well.

My proposal is to move BLDG-SIM to a forum format.  There's some
powerful--and widely used--software out there these days for managing
web-based forums.  I think most forum programs offer standard features
like dedicated topics, searching of threads, customizable interface,
etc.  I'm sure most of us have run across this type of web-based forum
before.

To address our specific problems, it seems like it would make sense to
have a dedicated topic for eQUEST on there, as well as topics for
"General Simulation Questions", "LEED", "ASHRAE 90.1", and I'm sure
several others would be appropriate too..."Simulation Interfaces"...who
knows...  Usually the forum software will let you put in hyperlinks to
posts in other threads as well.  So if one post in the "eQUEST" topic is
also relevant in a "General Simulation Questions" thread, someone can
post a hyperlink cross-reference.  

Otherwise, if BLDG-SIM were to not go the forum route, I would vote for
an eQUEST-only mailing list.

Go to the Detailed report option once you run a simulation, then go to 
the BEPS report if it doesnt direct you there automatically. To get 
there use the pull down menu at the top of  the program.

In DOE2.1E and in DOE2.2/eQuest, you can view the number of unmet loads
hours on a zone-by-zone basis in the SS-F report. This reports the number of
hours that the zone loads were not met broken down by month and by category
(i.e. heating or cooling).

In addition, the BEPU report gives you the total of unmet loads hours as a
percentage for the system simulation and the central plant simulation.
Be aware that the system unmet loads fraction can be misleading as it is the
number of zone loads not met by the system summed over all the zones.
Therefore, if one zone has unmet loads for 8760 hours then the fraction will
be reported as 100% even if all the other zones have zero unmet loads. 

With regard to the loads not met by the plant in the BEPU report, if these
occur at the same time as an unmet system load there will be double counting
of loads not met by the simulation.

My own view is that the Appendix G definition of unmet loads unfairly
penalises simulations with large numbers of zones. For example, in a 10 zone
simulation, each zone would need to have 30 hours with unmet loads to reach
the 300 hour limit. But in a simulation with 100 zones each zone would only
need 3 hours of unmet loads to reach 300 unmet loads hours. 

If I were to rewrite the relevant section of Appendix G to correct this
problem I would multiply the number of hours of unmet load for each zone by
that zone's fraction of building floor area. This would normalise the
measurement of unmet loads to the size of the building and the number of
zones in the simulation so that the maximum possible percentage of unmet
loads would be 100%.

You can click on the building level in the left-hand panel explorer when you
are in the air-side module of eQuest, and then go to the summary tab.  It
will summarize the zones and systems that have unmet loads.

(If you have selected a particular air system in the explorer you will get
the summary for only that system rather than all of the systems.)

I haven't experimented enough to know how it calculates the "building total"
unmet hours...if simultaneous unmet zones/systems count double or not.  It
does provide an overall project system unmet hours for you to use.

The temperature and humidity reports are also useful in the full output
-- in the sim viewer program you can scroll through the zones with the down
arrow once you've selected the desired report to spot any irregular
temperatures.  This might be hard to spot that one spurious hour, but it
will help you see if you are getting a lot of unmet hours at a time you
thought the system was supposed to off for example, or if the unmet hours
are at start-up.  Or perhaps there is a zone that has high temperatures in
winter due to a west facing window and the cooling is off.

Last idea, make sure you have consistent zone setpoint schedules and zone
design heating and cooling temperatures.  Maybe you have changed the
setpoint schedules during the project and not gone back to the design
setpoint to make the corresponding change.

Kristin:

Thanks for your reply. I will forward your response to the list.

If the standards only address sensible load, I'm wondering whether the Unmet
Load Hours is sufficient to evaluate the performance of a HVAC system,
especially in humid climate where indoor humidity control is an essential
part of the HVAC system. Since indoor humidity control may consume
significant energy depending on the equipment/system used, I think the unmet
latent load or the indoor humidity level should also be accounted for in the
building energy performance evaluation to get fair comparison between
proposed and baseline building designs.

Xiaobing,

I tried to send this email to the list, but there's a
glitch that doesn't allow my messages to get through. 
Anyway, here's my response for you at least:

My interpretation is that the standard is addressing
sensible load only and that it is for building-wide
hours of load unmet, not by zone.  Anyone disagree?

For eQUEST/DOE-2.2, this would mean that I'd say to
use the number on the BEPS report instead of from the
SS-R reports (although those are very helpful to look
at for other reasons).

1) How do I "turn off" the boiler and chiller that are still attached to

2) Is there a good tutorial source on what the inputs on the chilled

oops, here is a more helpful response

glare index
A method of predicting the presence of discomfort glare due to
delighting. Factors affecting the glare index include the size and
relative position of fenestration, sky luminance, and interior
luminance. Most widely used in Europe, the glare index is similar to the
index of sensation and the discomfort glare rating, which are used in
North America for electric lighting applications.

oops,
and for actual formula,  it seems there are some varying interpretations
though.

Mark,

The DOE-2 glare index is the Hopkinson glare index, which is basically 
the ratio of window luminance to the average surrounding surface 
luminance within the field of view.

The same glare index is calculated in EnergyPlus and is described in the 
EnergyPlus Engineering Reference documentation.  Search for Daylight 
Discomfort Glare, or Hopkinson for more details.

Yoko,

In note 5 under Table 11.3.2A, 90.1-2004 says for systems using
purchased chilled water, no chillers shall be modeled and CHW costs
shall be determined using the adopting authority's utility rates.  For
both the baseline and proposed buildings, you would not include central
chillers and instead use purchased chilled water.

Hi, everyone,

 

I am modeling a building that is served chilled water from a central
chiller, and the building doesn't have any individual chiller. 

I am wondering if  the baseline model (by ASHRAE 90.1-2004) should
follow ASHRAE specified "type and number of chillers" (TABLE G3.1.3.7,
ASHRAE 90.1-2004) depending on building conditioned floor area, or it
should be modeled with a Central chiller as proposed/designed model.  

 

Thank you for your help

Drawing a line between eQuest & DOE2/general modeling questions can be
difficult, especially to question-posers.  Also, I sometimes find the eQuest
dialog educational for my understanding of modeling beyond eQuest.  

Unless there is a way to shunt just the "I'm a new user and wondered.." type
questions to a different forum, consider this a vote for keeping them
together.

All,

I support the idea of a separate eQUEST mailing list.  The people 
speaking in favor of the combined list seem to be eQUEST users.  If 
there were separate lists, they could subscribe to both.  Those of us 
who are not interested in eQUEST operational details could subscribe 
to only the general list.

Anyone have information on property value increases for including/adding
solar energy (photovoltaics, and or hot water) to residential and/or
commercial buildings.

 

There is a reference out there to the Appraisal Journal saying 1$ reduction
in utility bills equals $20 in increased property values.  But this is for
conventional conservation improvements for residential.  Does it apply to
solar energy generation?

electric energy use related to the space cooling end-use is higher in the HP
model than in the PTAC model.  I would think the HP model would use less
energy since the EER is better....but this is not the case.  Does this make
sense?  Has anyone else run into this problem?  If so, any suggestions on
how to correct?
 
Thanks,

Dear All,
I am in the process of evaluating some free softwares and some paid softwares for my company. The intention is to be able to disseminate the information to even the design team and not keep it exclusively for the energy modellers or Eco-Services team.
A brief background of the company. It is a 120 people firm with a design team, production teams and Eco-services team. The design team should be able to do energy analysis, shading and daylighting analysis etc.

I think any kind of blog or mailing list will be a good idea. The best thing would be if these articles or any kind of information is  archived by topic.
eg: shading, daylighting, plug loads, energy consumption.
Archives can include different softwares, problems with softwares, design strategies etc.
Right now the bldg-sim archives are by thread and it is a tedious process, to go check the threads which look relevant until you find the answer to your question or post your question (where you will be the zillionth person to ask the same thing) and irritate everybody who feels that you should have checked the archives before posting the question.

this will reduce the number of threads(e-mails in inbox) and get the everyone's questions answered.

Thanks,
Ruju.

kind of a virtual simulation coffee shop.  Although presented with a

I do search the archives with google periodically, especially when I

some grant money from google for that?  I'd rather someone find grant
money to expand the library of simulation modules available in the
various software packages :)  I think the blog is good also, picking out
some of the most interesting topics and archiving them in addition to
the archives here.  

So I would vote for bldg-sim status quo, but kudos for raising the idea

It's great that we can even have this discussion involving different
software and methods.  If each vendor had their own board we'd be the
lesser for it.

Don't worry, I'm not trying to stuff the ballot box.  Just wanted to ask
the question "what about the archives"?  

Following this list (or multiple lists) to me is only part of the value.
Perhaps even more valuable is the archival knowledge base, and its
simply easier to search if all the information is in one place.
Personally I wouldn't mind it a bit if EnergyPlus was combined with this
list, as gigabyes more valuable information would be searchable with the
same query used on BLDG-SIM info.  

We all I think agree that whenever software-specific questions are
raised or answered that the software be identified in the subject line.

There are newbies who don't know, and oldies that sometimes forget this
simple etiquette courtesy.  But please don't throw out the baby
(integrated searchable archive) with the bath water (over occasional
breaches of etiquette).  

Ultimately I think we need a BLDG-SIM Wiki.  Google has a roll-your-own
hosted wiki service in the works (similar to blogger, rumored soon-to-be
released), which may make the topical differentiation issues moot.

Let's think about this a bit before pulling the trigger on a new list
too quickly... unless of course you're tired of reading my posts!

I would like to support the start of a separate eQuest list. Subscribing
to different groups is not a big deal; I follow the EnergyPlus digest
just like BLDG-SIM. However, especially from a non-US viewpoint, one
sometimes does get the feeling that eQuest is a bit too prominent on
BLDG-SIM (especially when specific messages on its use fail to mention
this in the subject line). Having a dedicated list for eQuest would also
allow more focus for those with an active interest.

My vote would be to keep the status quo.  

We use Trace and HAP as do I'm sure many BLDG-SIM subscribers, but the
difference I think in terms of traffic on BLDG-SIM is lack of telephone
support for eQuest -- and that's not a knock, we wouldn't be using
eQuest if we didn't think it was an excellent product.

FWIW...

I completely agree with Vikram, its always great to talk about the other
tools as well without having to belong to another mailing list and then
have the cross postings etc.  This certainly works great for me.

Personally, I don't see the need for it. Unless non-eQUEST users are
getting irritated by the eQUESTions, the current listserve works really
well. I use eQUEST mostly, but its always nice to hear some of the news
from other software.  I would say that the building sim list works just
fine - lets not try and fix it.

I personally think it's a great idea...enough people use eQUEST in the
built-environment to warrant a separate mailing list.  Furthermore,
since there isn't really a concise instruction manual for how to use
eQUEST, the archived information could be of great import to someone
just getting into the field or even seasoned modelers.

I completely support the idea of a separate list. The BLDG-SIM list 
should be for general discussion of modelling issues - topics that are 
of general interest to the modelling community, whatever program they 
are using. Most other simulation programs have their own lists for 
program-specific questions, so that everyone is not inconvenienced by 
questions that are of limited general interest.

I also agree to not having a separate eQUEST list, considering use of
one tool (such as eQUEST) very often touches on other tools (solar PV,
etc.) and other topics (LEED) very quickly while trying to find out
capabilities and limitations of each tool and goal of the modeling. For
example, are you doing something that is a quick check or is it a LEED
model. Another point I'd like to make is that even though an answer is
made in regards to eQUEST, the philosophy or basis may still be equally
applicable to other modeling programs and methods.

I completely agree with Vikram, its always great to talk about the other
tools as well without having to belong to another mailing list and then
have the cross postings etc.  This certainly works great for me.

I am trying to use the DOE-2 weather processor to convert measured data (dry
bulb temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, radiation, wind
speed, wind direction and sky cover) into a .bin file. I am using the OTHER
format and the PACK command.

I tried to use the weather processor that is distributed with EE4, called
'wth' and it reads the input file, and does not cause errors, but the data
it LISTS must be default data, (db = 0, pressure = 0.2 for, etc for all 8760
entries) - it is definitely not the data I have listed in the WEATHR.TMPfile!!

When I use the weather processor from the DOE website, "DOEWTH" it reads the
INPUT.TMP file, but does not read the weather file.

Any idea where I am going wrong, or what may be happening. If anyone has
successfully converted an OTHER file to .bin, could you send me the
WEATHR.TMP file??

Thanking you in advance.

I personally think it's a great idea...enough people use eQUEST in the
built-environment to warrant a separate mailing list.  Furthermore,
since there isn't really a concise instruction manual for how to use
eQUEST, the archived information could be of great import to someone
just getting into the field or even seasoned modelers.

eQUEST only mailing list. Please let me know what you think whether you

Hello Steve,
 
There are plenty of time-traps in eQuest.  One of my objectives as
defacto "Energy Program Manager" here is to develop clear, repeatable
processes for jr. engineers and energy analysts to follow.  Follow these
links to some eQuest tips, learned the "hard way": 
 
Multi-Level Spaces <http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/search?q=atrium> 
<http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/search?q=atrium>  
eQuest Wizard Checklist
<http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/2006/11/equest-wizard-checklist.html
> 
 
There are others on the blog, some specific to what we do here, but many
are generally applicable.  Two of our biggest time-savers are 1)
simplification of geometry, i.e. 'flat roofs everywhere', and 2)
elimination of plenums.
 
FWIW...

Hello,

I have been sub-ing out modeling work for some time now and have enough
base knowledge to take a crack a doing my own.

Besides the DOE manual and specific software manuals  are there any
handbooks etc... that give a good information concerning energy modeling

Any "rules of thumb" for estimating time required for developing models
in eQuest? I recognize there is a learning curve, I am asking more for
someone who know what they are doing. What are you looking at, time
wise, for example for a 3 storey, 30 000 sq. ft office with straight
forward RTU's and curtain wall?

One week, two week, 3 days?

 Cheers,

Steve

its easy, just do it and when you get to a wall, there are lots of

I don't know if this has been answered but anything entered in the wizard can be changed in detailed edit mode, you just have to find it. Better than relying on the GUI you can delve into the inp file with a text editor and find the COP/SEER manually to make the change.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Question about Inputting COP and SEER values in Detailed Data Edit Mode



I was wondering if anyone knew how to input COP and SEER values in the Detailed Data Edit Mode? I am comparing design variations for a building and am just changing the values from the first file rather than inputting everything all over again in a new file. Can I change the COP and SEER values in the Detailed Data Edit Mode or do I have to go back to the Building Creation Wizard to accomplish this? 

 

Thanks,

Dear All,
I am trying to calculate the cost savings of using EnergyStar equipment
vs conventional equipment in a 25000 sq ft office.
Does anyone know of an equipment listing for an office with its power
consumption or power density (W/sq ft).
The baseline in eQuest is 1.213W/sq ft. Does anyone know the equipment
and power consumption that eQuest is taking into consideration?
 
Let me know.
 
Thanks,
Ruju.

Ruju,

 

You might look at the article by Hosni and Wilkins / ASHRAE Journal /
June 2000 "Heat Gain from Office Equipment." It has an overview of
measured W/sf and discusses the impact of nameplate vs. average energy
consumption as well as typical diversity factors.

 

The article should be available from ashrae.org through the bookstore.
An excerpt is published in the ASHRAE 2005 Fundamentals pp30.8-30.12.

No need to manipulate the models to get to 25%.  It is common for an
elementary school to not have 25%.

 

If you do not achieve the minimum of 25% all you need to do is submit a
detailed list of the equipment planned for the building to demonstrate the
actual plug load.  Be sure to include all loads including cooking,
refrigeration, computers, etc.  The last sentence in the third box at the
bottom of page 173 of the LEED v2.2 Reference Guide refers to this
supporting documentation.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] 25% Process Load in ASHRAE baseline building

 

Hello All-

 

I am using eQUEST to model an elementary school that will be submitted with
the projects LEED documentation.  LEED NC 2.2 from October 2005 states that
the proposed building "must be compared against a baseline building that
complies with Appendix G to Standard 90.1-2004 (without amendments). The
default process energy cost is 25% of the total energy cost for the baseline
building".  

 

My question:  What is the best way to incorporate a 25% process load into
the eQUEST file?  I know that I could put in a misc load into the ASHRAE
baseline building I created, and play with that number until it reaches 25%
of the total energy use, but it seems like there should be a better way to
incorporate this load. 

 

Any help is much appreciated!

 

Thanks,

Bridgette

Kendra,

Yes, one can take credit for low flow fixtures that reduce the gpm for 
domestic hot water. This issue has been addressed in the Addendum to ASHRAE 
Standard 90.1-2004, Section G4.3. You can download the addenda supplement 
package from:

 http://www.ashrae.org/technology/page/132

Sometime ago, USGBC accepted the use of Addendums to 90.1, so this would be 
acceptable.

For baseline gpm, see Section 7.2 of 90.1, which further refers the ASHRAE 
Handbook- HVAC Applications for load calculations.

Quick question on the LEED Energy model based on ASHRAE 90.1-2004
Appendix G.

In Table G3.1 of ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the section on Schedules (#4) states
that the schedules for the baseline and Proposed buildings may differ to
model non-standard energy efficiency measures such as "measures that
reduce service water heating loads."  Does this mean that we can take
credit for low flow water devices that reduce the gpm consumed for
domestic hot water?

This gpm is never regulated in the standard, but a baseline is
calculated for the LEED Water Efficiency credit.  It seems as though you
should be able to take credit for pumping/heating energy savings from
reducing the gallons of domestic hot water consumed per year.  If so,
what do you use as your "baseline" gpm?

Thank you!

The newer GLASS-TYPE-CODE entries in the library are identified by 
longer, more descriptive names rather than just the four digit number.  
You can search through the BDLLib.dat file in your \DOE-2 subdirectory 
for "7054" and you will find that the corresponding library 
GLASS-TYPE-CODE is actually called "Clr/Air1/HM44 Susp/Air1/Clr 6".  If 
you use that complete name when referencing this glass type then the BDL 
error will go away.

All-

Has anyone modeled an Ice Rink in DOE2?  Most of the keywords seem to work, however the "CEILING-EMISS" and the "RINK-EMISS" do not change anything.  This is troubling since the emissivity of the ice and especially the ceiling should have an effect on the radiant heat exchange between the two.  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Fred,
 
DOE 2.2 is capable of using a schedule with a unique value for each hour
of the year.  This allows capabilities similar to the file-load feature
in DOE2.1e.  This is a good way to assign an external load to a
circulation loop.   
 
For anyone interested I have attached a template for an hourly value
schedule to use in DOE2.2.  It has 53 weeks and 375 days.  The annual
week end-dates are currently set up for 2005.  The holidays are not set
up to match their corresponding day, that would have to be done by the
user.
 
The schedule I included is a fraction schedule so you will need to
normalize your data similar to the method for making performance curves.
I mentioned one way of doing this in my earlier email.
 
I recommend making changes within the template first and then importing
the file into your DOE2.2/equest project.
 
I recently used this to model the performance of an ERV system on a heat
pump   
 
 
Regards,
 
Mike

circulation loop.   
 
For anyone interested I have attached a template for an hourly value
schedule to use in DOE2.2.  It has 53 weeks and 375 days.  The annual
week end-dates are currently set up for 2005.  The holidays are not set
up to match their corresponding day, that would have to be done by the
user.
 
The schedule I included is a fraction schedule so you will need to
normalize your data similar to the method for making performance curves.
I mentioned one way of doing this in my earlier email.
 
I recommend making changes within the template first and then importing
the file into your DOE2.2/equest project.
 
I recently used this to model the performance of an ERV system on a heat
pump

Hi, 
 
For a new building addition 5000sqft tied into existing 30,000sqft
building, when the HVAC system is tied into the existing chiller and
boiler plant, does it mean I will need to model the whole building new
and existing? From interpretations of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 appendix G, table
G3.1, "on alterations and additions", it sort of listed the new building
will need to be completely excluded from existing HVAC in order to be
modeled separately. 
 
And how will the LEED credit be accounted for EA credit 1?
 
Thanks

Hello all,
   
  I experienced a problem when I use DOE2.2 today. I use the the DOE2.2 library (Usrlib.dat) for defining windows. But it seems that DOE2.2 only allows me to use 1,2,3 series glass from the library. I use "3672" type glass, but when I change to type "7054", the .bdl reports "SYMBOL PREVIOUSLY UNDEFINED", while I can change to other 3 series glass type (for exampe 3684) without any problem.
   
  Does anybody knows that what I am doing wrong?
   
  Thanks a lot. I appreciate your help.
   
  Regards,
   
  David Tian

Vikram,
 
Perhaps you are using older version of IGDB in WINDOW 5.2.  The PPG's
Solarban 70XL is available in IGDB from ID 5431 to 5434 in thicknesses
from 2 to 5 mm.  To update IGDB in WINDOW 5, go to windows.lbl.gov web
site, navigate to WINDOW program pages and see instructions how to
update IGDB.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think your design building can vary from
the 90.1 prescriptions (at least for the ECB which is what I am assuming
your using it for - give the design case reference). For example if you
use daylight sensors and you want to use a lighter glass to take
advantage of it, I think you can as long as there's an overall energy
savings - am I correct?
 
Speaking of high performance glass - I am trying to model PPG's Solarban
70, and it doesn't seem to be available in the window 5.2 database. (Its
a new product with a 0.63 Tviz & 0.27 SHGC - a light to solar gain ratio
of 2.33). Is it possible to manipulate the numbers in Window 5.2? Is the
simplified glazing option acceptable for 90.1 ECB analyses?

International Glazing Database (IGDB), which is part of WINDOW 5.2
program (windows.lbl.gov) contains several hundred individual glass
layers whose solar transmittance is at or below 0.3, which, as a part of
glazing system and whole fenestration product, would produce SHGC of
0.25 or lower, which meets ASHRAE 90.1 for all climate zones.  The best
choice for low SHGC windows is so called spectrally selective low-e, and
there are at least 100 glass products with this type of low-e coating.
The cost of these products is only marginally higher than the cost of
clear glass.
 
I think that you are definitely overlooking something.
 
Having said that, I do want to state that the use of low SHGC products
in heating dominated climates (anything at or above climate zone 5) is
wrong and is the major flaw of both ASHRAE 90.1 and IECC 2006,
particularly for orientations with potentially high solar gain in the
winter, such as South orientation.

When modeling my design case, I find that most windows cannot achieve
the minimum SHGC suggested in ASHRAE 90.1.

 

Why would ASHRAE set unattainable minimum values?      

 

Am I overlooking something in ASHRAE 90.1???

 

Any help would be appreciated.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709181621.AA2152500pd80001496483@gard.com>

Hello all,

 

My question involves the use of a water-side economizer for achieving
"free cooling" during the off peak months.  Has anyone been able to gain
the benefits from this system?  I believe the source of my troubles is
in the control of the CHW temperature in the Condenser Loop.  When
looking at the hourly reports, I find that the air to water delta T
never exceeds the limit defined in the definition of the water-side
economizer.  Is there some type of temperature control method for the
condenser water that I am not using?  

 

Thank you for your help.

Hey,

 

I'm trying to model PV power generation on a rooftop using eQuest. Does
anyone know how to calculate the Minimum/Maximum Tracking Voltages for
an Electrical Generator?? These values define the operating limits for
the generator.

 

Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709181149.AA4951968pd80001496169@gard.com>

Dear all:
 
Does anyone have suggestions or experience on these two issues?
 
1) My eQuest case is created using an INP file. After I change in the Detailed Data Edit mode and ran it, the Export Hourly Results was grayed out. Is there a way to get the 8760 data output?
 
2) In a different file, I am trying to create a water source heat pump which supplies hot water for radiant heating. No matter how I set the loop and the heat pump temperature, I kept getting this message
 
***ERROR***********************************************************************
             In zone-sp-1-1F_Core               , heating coil leaving
             temperature must be at least 10F lower than entering
             water temp.  EWT = 100.0 LAT = 112.0

What should I change to resolve this problem? 
 
Thanks a lot.

EnergyPlus allows the import of frame performance.  It also lets you do
single and double vision windows, as opposed to DOE 2 that allows you only
singe vision windows.  When comparing window performance, it is also
important to have standard buildings, so that meaningful comparison of
different windows can be made.  EFEN tool
(www.designbuildersoftware.com/efen.php), based on EnergyPlus, incorporates
several standard commercial building types, allowing window performance
comparison.  Size and shape of the building can be changed and windows
created in WINDOW and THERM can be imported into the program.  Energy and
cost savings are calculated including HVAC downsizing.  Over 500 generic
windows and glazing options are included for selection of baseline windows.
Typical baseline window would be single or double clear glazing in Aluminum
frame.

Charlie

Kevin,

 

ASHRAE 90.1 defines the window performance of the entire window assembly
which includes both the frame and glass.  DOE2.2 requires that you enter
glass performance and frame performance separately.  DOE 2.2 has libraries
of GLASS performance which means you still have to define the frame
performance.  The WINDOW software does not export frame performance into
DOE2.2 only the glass performance.  You would input any frame performance
you calculate using THERM directly into DOE2.2 as FRAME-CONDUCTANCE and
FRAME-WIDTH.

 

There is no library of baseline glass because every window assembly has
different performance based on the differences in frame and glass area.  The
best you can do is select baseline glass performance and baseline frame
performance so that the area-weighted performance of all the window
assemblies in your project equals the baseline window performance criteria
(ie U-value and SHGC) from whatever code (ie. ASHRAE 90.1) your modeling.


 

Charlie,

Does Energy Plus allow you to import FRAME performance from the WINDOW
software?      

 

 

Mike

Is there a library of baseline windows available?  Perhaps one that may
compare a performance window to an ASHRAE standard.  This sounds like
something that would be very useful.  Instead of using inaccurate baseline
models for government incentive programs and LEED certifications.

Kevin,

 

The best way to accurately model windows is with WINDOW and THERM software
(windows.lbl.gov).  These tools are also used for NFRC (National
Fenestration Rating Council) certifications.  However, you will need all of
the details of frame and glazing design to be able to utilize these tools.
WINDOW program is used to model glazing system and THERM program is used to
model frame and edge of glass sections.  The whole product is then assembled
again in WINDOW program, so WINDOW has dual role.  While WINDOW program is
easy to learn and can be accomplished in half a day, THERM program requires
2-3 days of training for novice users.  Several companies offer training and
our company (www.designbuildersoftware.com) is one of them.  WINDOW program
creates DOE2 report file, which can be used with DOE 2.2 to assign windows.
That provides the most accurate way to model windows energy performance in a
building.

 

If you don't have all of the details and wish to get estimated performance,
you can use one of the predefined windows in DOE 2.2, closest to what you
have.  You should not use simplified way (i.e., by assigning simple
U-factor, SHGC and VT as single number), because that produces gross errors.
EnergyPlus program, which is newer generation energy simulation engine from
DOE does not even have an option to specify windows and doors that way.  You
have to have WINDOW EnergyPlus report file (equivalent to DOE2 report file)
or use one of predefined windows in EnergyPlus.  Our tool DesignBuilder uses
EnergyPlus simulation engine, so you can try it out.

 

If you have further questions, you can contact us directly.

Charlie Curcija

IBPSA-USA is now accepting abstracts for SimBuild 2008! 
Abstracts may be submitted via our website at
http://gaia.lbl.gov/ocs/index.php/simbuild/2008

Please note that Dec. 1, 2007 is a firm deadline for all abstracts. See
below for more information about SimBuild 2008 including other key
deadlines. 

 

SimBuild 2008

IBPSA-USA will hold its third national conference, July 30 to August 1,
2008 on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley. The
format will be similar to the two previous SimBuild conferences held at
the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2004 and at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 2006.

The conference organizers are limiting the number of peer-reviewed oral
presentations in order to maintain a high level of quality in the
papers.  Submissions will therefore be rigorously peer-reviewed.
Abstracts are due by 1 December 2007 (firm deadline) and may be on a
variety of building and environmental simulation topics, such as: system
or component modeling, simulation algorithm development, CFD
applications, IAQ, acoustics, energy, lighting, life safety, weather,
city-scale environmental simulations, or case studies that exhibit
in-depth use of simulation software.  Authors should indicate a
preference for poster or oral presentation.  In addition, a limited
number of non-peer-reviewed oral presentations are sought in order to
enable practitioners and researchers to address simulation-related
issues of strong current interest - please contact Philip Haves
<phaves at lbl.gov> <mailto:phaves at lbl.gov>  (510) 486 6512.

The meeting is open to all, world-wide. Being near San Francisco,
Berkeley is a convenient destination for travelers from major cities in
the U.S. and in many other countries.  U.C. Berkeley is the oldest
campus of the University of California system, which also operates the
well-known Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Lawrence Hall of
Science, the Space Sciences Laboratory, and the U.C. Botanical Garden.
The city of Berkeley contains a variety of neighborhoods with diverse
character and excellent restaurants.  The "Bay Area" is full of visitor
attractions accessible within 20 minutes, such as the city of San
Francisco, scenic mountains, and rich architecture (including the Frank
Lloyd Wright Civic Center).  Numerous wineries are within one hour
travel to the Napa and Sonoma valleys, where wine-tasting tours are
available.    

Key Dates:

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Ice Rinks in DOE2
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709171103.AA0308703pd80003694774@gard.com>

All-

Has anyone modeled an Ice Rink in DOE2?  Most of the keywords seem to work,
however the "CEILING-EMISS" and the "RINK-EMISS" do not change anything.
This is troubling since the emissivity of the ice and especially the ceiling
should have an effect on the radiant heat exchange between the two.  Any
thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks-

Is there a library of baseline windows available?  Perhaps one that may
compare a performance window to an ASHRAE standard.  This sounds like
something that would be very useful.  Instead of using inaccurate baseline
models for government incentive programs and LEED certifications.

Kevin,

 

The best way to accurately model windows is with WINDOW and THERM software
(windows.lbl.gov).  These tools are also used for NFRC (National
Fenestration Rating Council) certifications.  However, you will need all of
the details of frame and glazing design to be able to utilize these tools.
WINDOW program is used to model glazing system and THERM program is used to
model frame and edge of glass sections.  The whole product is then assembled
again in WINDOW program, so WINDOW has dual role.  While WINDOW program is
easy to learn and can be accomplished in half a day, THERM program requires
2-3 days of training for novice users.  Several companies offer training and
our company (www.designbuildersoftware.com) is one of them.  WINDOW program
creates DOE2 report file, which can be used with DOE 2.2 to assign windows.
That provides the most accurate way to model windows energy performance in a
building.

 

If you don't have all of the details and wish to get estimated performance,
you can use one of the predefined windows in DOE 2.2, closest to what you
have.  You should not use simplified way (i.e., by assigning simple
U-factor, SHGC and VT as single number), because that produces gross errors.
EnergyPlus program, which is newer generation energy simulation engine from
DOE does not even have an option to specify windows and doors that way.  You
have to have WINDOW EnergyPlus report file (equivalent to DOE2 report file)
or use one of predefined windows in EnergyPlus.  Our tool DesignBuilder uses
EnergyPlus simulation engine, so you can try it out.

 

If you have further questions, you can contact us directly.

 

Regards,

Charlie Curcija

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Simplied windows and glass libraries

Can anyone offer advice on the most accurate route to model window
performance?

There are discrepancies between modeling glazing from doe library and then
modeling those values in simplified mode.

Is this steady state vs. transient heat transfer?  I am not familiar and I
could use a lesson in thermo.

Is this discussed in the Engineer's Manual?  How about if I used Window5?
Will I be able to import Window files into Doe2.2?

 

 

 

I would be grateful of any assistance.

 

Kevin

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709141031.AA3140281pd80001494362@gard.com>

Maurice:
 
Before eQUEST version 3.61e is released, to view the hourly leaving temperature of the ground loop heat exchanger (GLHX), you have to create a hourly report and specify the GLHX outlet temperature as the reported variable. After specifying the hourly report and run the simulation, you will see the GLHX leaving temperature reported hour by hour at the end (or before the Economic reports) of the SIM file.
 
In eQUEST version 3.61e, there is a section in the PS-H report that summarizes the temperature of GLHX on a monthly basis. This report gives counts on hours when the GLHE (leaving) temperature is within each of the 12 temperature bins from less than 20F up to higher than 120F. The hour counts are reported for cooling and heating mode, respectively. A yearly summary of the maximum and minimum GLHE temperature in both heating and cooling modes is also given at the end of the section. In addition, flow rate and velocity in the U-tube, borehole thermal resistance, and the head loss over the GLHE (it is still a constant at current version) are reported at the beginning of the section. 
 
It appears that eQUEST 3.61e has not been formally released yet, but a beta version is available in the eQUEST download area ( http://doe2.com/download/equest/).
 
Hope it helps,
 
Xiaobing

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709131149.AA4933203pd80001493769@gard.com>

Hello all,
   
  From the help file of eQUEST, it seems that eQUEST 3.6 can model air-to-water heat pump, well-water-to-water heat-pump and loop-to-loop heat-pump.
   
  When I model from the DD Wizard, the only system type alowed for heat pump is DX system, which means there is no chilled water flow in the systems. So I have to find a new method.
   
  I built up a conventional system with water cooled, then I change the chiller type to loop-to-loop heat pump, then the program ask me for HW loop, HW loop pump and CW loop, I selected the HW loop to hot water loop and associated pump, but I can not select the condensor water loop as the CW loop. It asked me to choose from libarry, so I chosed from Default-CW, but the program give me the warning " the Default-CW is an imcompatible type".
   
  I tried other loop types, but on one works. Does anyone has successfully tried this loop-to-loop heat pump before? Or is there any direction for set this up in eQUEST?
   
  Any suggestion is hightly appreciated.
   
  Thanks.
   
  Regards,
   
  David

BASEBOARD-SCH


Takes the U-name of a SCHEDULE (TYPE=RESET-RATIO) that defines the
relationship between baseboard heat output and outside air temperature, and
specifies the days of the year during which this relationship applies. This
keyword applies only if BASEBOARD-CTRL = OUTDOOR-RESET. If BASEBOARD-CTRL =
THERMOSTATIC, the program will use HEAT-TEMP-SCH to control the baseboards.
Note that the DAY-RESET-SCH keywords SUPPLY-HI and SUPPLY-LO, which usually
specify temperatures, are used here to specify baseboard output as a
fraction of BASEBOARD-RATING. 

You must be careful to avoid shutdown of system heating capability (see
HEATING-SCHEDULE) during periods when baseboard heating is desired. 

Example input:

BASE-DAY-1 = DAY-RESET-SCH
TYPE               = RESET-RATIO
SUPPLY-HI          = 1.0
SUPPLY-LO          = 0.0
OUTSIDE-HI         = 70.0
OUTSIDE-LO         = 0.0  ..

BASE-SCHED-1 = SCHEDULE
TYPE               = RESET-RATIO
THRU DEC 31 (ALL)  BASE-DAY-1 ..

SYS-1 = SYSTEM
BASEBOARD-SCH= BASE-SCHED-1
....

In this example, baseboard heat is fully on for outside temperature below 0F
and decreases linearly to zero when the outside temperature reaches 70F.

This is normal behavior. You should find that your custom window/door 
inputs are reflected in the detailed model generated from your wizard 
inputs.
The # doors and % windows inputs on the main wizard screens serve as 
defaults for populating the custom window/door facets, but changes made 
in the custom window/door screen are not ever reflected in the original 
# doors & % windows screens.

WINDOW 6 (available from http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/window.html)
can model shading devices.  Perforated panel can be modeled by assigning
percentage to opening and to opaque areas.

All

I am currently trying to input a building into Comcheck that has a
perforated metal panel in front of a number of areas of glazing. What I want
to do is take into account the shading of the panels. As the projection
factor only takes into account a horizontal overhang I can't see a way of
accomplishing this.

Has anyone else had this situation and if so what was your solution?

Thanks in advance

Provided the perforated shade cannot be removed (i.e., permanently mounted),
and provided the sun always strikes it before passing through to the window,
I would use the shade?s transmissivity as a multiplier to adjust the
window?s SHGC downward.

P.S.  I make no claim that this as an official interpretation of the code

David,
 
The default additional ERV supply and exhaust pressure drops are 1.5"
each, you may be able to set these down, check with the mechanical
engineer.  Is your ERV set up to be a 'sidecar', or is it in-line with
the main fans?  If sidecar, then the ERV fans are switched, else the
additional ERV pressure drop deprecates performance year-around.  
 
Does ERV-RECOVER-MODE = OA-HEATING ? Acutally it can't, if your using
ERV-RUN-CTRL = WHEN-MIN-OA as I just re-discovered.  This is probably
why I use OA-EXHAUST-DT for sensible-only heat recovery, so I can turn
off the heat recovery in the summer where it's not going to any good.
 
Have 3 fairly recent posts on heat recovery, see..
 
http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/search/label/Heat%20Recovery
 
 
Hope that helps...

 Dear all,
 
I am modelling an office building in the cold climate (Zone 7). The
baseline case for ASHRAE 90.1-2004 is VAV system. To evaluate the effect
of air system heat recovery, I add the ERV in the Outdoor Air/Heat
Recovery 1&2 tab. I select the ERV type as Sensible Heat Exange with
effective as 0.52, the control sequence set as "when minimum OA".
 
However, the simulatio result I got is kind of weird, cooling, fan and
pump energy increase a lot, while the heating energy use was reduced
only around 6%. Could somebody tell me what maybe the problem casuing
this weired results or how can I check whether the result is correct?
 
Thanks a lot.

David

The International Building Code is Section 1502 defines a penthouse as
an equipment space occupying not more than 1/3 of the roof area.

If you get about this threshold, it's a floor.

In Table G3.1.1A, the baseline building system is selected based on
building area and the number of floors. Does anyone know if a Penthouse
is considered a floor? From the A90.1 definitions, it appears that the
Penthouse should be included in the gross floor area, but whether the
Penthouse should be considered in defining the baseline building system
type is unclear. For a 120,000 SF building that has 5 floors and a
Penthouse and purchased heat, the baseline system could be System 5 if
the Penthouse is not counted as a floor or System 7 if the Penthouse is
included. Can anyone help clarify this?

The method equest uses for simulating underground surfaces is the preffered
method for calculating underground surface heat transfer in DOE2.  The
method is based on work done by Joe Huang et all in 1988 and revised by Fred
Winkelmann in 2002.  THe revised method was published in the Nov/Dec 2002
Building Energy Simulation newsletter under the title "Underground Surfaces:
How to get a Better Underground Surface Heat Transfer Calculation in
DOE2.1E".  
 
My suggestion is that you select your underground wall insulation using the
pre-defined wizard inputs and then leave them be in the detailed edit mode.
If you feel the need to do something different I suggest you consult the
article referenced above.

Hello,
 
I am trying to model perimeter foundation insulation using eQUEST, and I am
trying to locate the best possible method to do so.  The default underground
wall construction uses the basic construction type configuration with
materials spread over the entire floor.  The help function of eQUEST,
version 3.60, refers to the variable PERIM-CONDUCT, but it is nowhere to be
found in this version of eQUEST.  Does anyone know which version of eQUEST
contains the new perimeter insulation variable and/or a feasible way to

I would suggest that a mechanical penthouse is not a floor when
determining baseline system type as the presence of the penthouse is for
the equipment that could otherwise be packaged rooftop equipment in the
baseline building.  If the penthouse is not cooled and heated by the
forced air system, then if there is some economic break-point for "tall"
vs "short" buildings the penthouse wouldn't tip the building into the
tall category.

Also, is it less than 5% of the building gross floor area and/or wall
area?  That's the level at which the standard doesn't require a separate
description for an envelope wall type, maybe that could be extended to
the significance of including the penthouse in system selection?

Obviously, if it was an occupied penthouse served by the system under
consideration and greater than 5% of the gross floor area, then I would
count it as a floor.

These are my thoughts, as I actually have this same question in reverse
for a basement mechanical room and would like to hear what others have

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] baseline system

 

In Table G3.1.1A, the baseline building system is selected based on
building area and the number of floors. Does anyone know if a Penthouse
is considered a floor? From the A90.1 definitions, it appears that the
Penthouse should be included in the gross floor area, but whether the
Penthouse should be considered in defining the baseline building system
type is unclear. For a 120,000 SF building that has 5 floors and a
Penthouse and purchased heat, the baseline system could be System 5 if
the Penthouse is not counted as a floor or System 7 if the Penthouse is
included. Can anyone help clarify this?

Thanks,

Bill Talbert

i think in either case you would be using system 5.
table g3.1.1a of appendix G, recommends using system 5 for non  
residential buildings that are 5 floors or less & between 75000  
-150000 SF. i believe it should read 5 floors or more instead of 5  
floors or less. there is more clarity in the user manual on page  
G-23. I would check the errata sheet to be double sure.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709120909.AA0951406pd80001492035@gard.com>

Dear all

I am simulating a  building with air-cooled heat pump chiller. There are
three air-cooled heat pump chillers in the chiller plant. But When I creat
more than one heat pump in Equest, I got error information such as
"HEAT-EIR-FPLR in chiller  has assinged building component '
RecipAir-EIR-fPLR-4Comp/Ckt' is of an incompatible
type"?RecipAir-EIR-fPLR-4Comp/Ckt is the default performance curve for such
heat pump chiller. And I have tried to change the curve to '
ScrewAir-EIR-fPLR-1Comp/Ckt' , It doesn't work. There is still error
information "HEAT-EIR-FPLR in chiller  has assinged building component '
RecipAir-EIR-fPLR-4Comp/Ckt' is of an incompatible type"?But if I just built
only one heat pump chiller , there will be no such problem. It made me
wonder . I think if it is a bug .

If any one have idea of  it , please give me some advice. I will very
appreciate for your help .

Hi Mark,

In detailed interface, go to "Utility and Economics" and open your Electric
energy meter (EM1).  Under "Direct Loads" you should see a number that
corresponds to the exterior lighting value you entered in the wizard.  There
will also be a schedule associated with it.  This was created from the
"dayshape" entered in the wizard and can be modified, though not as
elegantly as in the wizard.

Karen,
 
What do you mean by floating hours -- system off?  Perhaps your
schedules are not assigned correctly.  
 
Here's a post with an enthalpy wheel I simulated recently that works as
expected...

Ok, so I have just noticed:

A comparison between the SS-M report of the baseline (no erv) and ERV
models shows that the ERV uses a little more fan energy for heating and
cooling modes (this seems reasonable) and then a HUGE amount more during
floating hours. 

This is what I have input (through a parametric run) for ERV's

   ERV-RECOVER-TYPE = ENTHALPY-WHEEL
   ERV-RUN-CTRL     = WHEN-MIN-OA
   ERV-CAP-CTRL     = MODULATE-HX
   ERV-FANS         = HVAC-SUPPLY/RETURN 
   ERV-FAN-EFF      = 0.9
   ERV-MOTOR-CLASS  = PREMIUM
   ERV-OA-KW/FLOW   = 8.5e-005
   ERV-FROST-CTRL   = USE-CAP-CTRL

	Ok, so there have been a couple post recently asking about
energy savings from ERV's in eQuest.  The concern is that there is some
reduction in cooling and heating energy use, but a significant increase
in fan energy use. 
	
	Here's my thought:  in the baseline case, the only energy
expended with respect to ventilation air is the energy required to heat
and cool the outdoor air, but the fan energy to move the ventilation air
through ductwork is not represented.  (If someone knows where to put
this number, or how to represent it, please let me know).  Any other
thoughts/suggestions out there? 
	
	I am trying to get to the bottom of this as well, because so
far, according to eQuest, installing an ERV has not made much sense.
	
	Also, is there a way to turn off the airside economizer?  I'm
modeling a building with heat pumps.  There is an ERV for ventilation,
but no economizer. 
	
	Thanks,

In Detailed Data Edit mode, if you bring up Electric Meter Properties by
double clicking on one of the meters in the component tree, you can
access the exterior lighting on the "Direct Loads" tab.  This load gets
directly assigned to the meter.

Hello all

My question relates to how eQUEST accesses the CAD files used in the
wizard to create perimeter/zone shapes.  It spends a lot of time
accessing these files after the user is out of the wizard when there is
no longer any use for them.  Is there any way to stop this other then
going back to the wizard?

Hello,
 
I am trying to model perimeter foundation insulation using eQUEST, and
I am trying to locate the best possible method to do so.  The default
underground wall construction uses the basic construction type
configuration with materials spread over the entire floor.  The help
function of eQUEST, version 3.60, refers to the variable PERIM-CONDUCT,
but it is nowhere to be found in this version of eQUEST.  Does anyone
know which version of eQUEST contains the new perimeter insulation
variable and/or a feasible way to model perimeter insulation using the
U-effective keyword?

You can add polygons in detailed mode in much the same way as in the
wizard and then designate it as a zone without reverting to wizard mode.
When in 2D graphical mode you right click and select the floor of
interest, then click on the left-most tool button on the floating pallet
(the one with a grid and tiny red outline). You can base the new polygon
on an existing one but as far as I know you can't use CAD as a reference
as you do in the wizard. Using the floating pallet you then save and
return to the component tree. You assing the polygon in the same way as
you assign HVAC systems.

Hello all, 

If I am already in detail mode but found out that a periimeter zone

the perimeter zone?
Or can I do something in detail model to save all the troubles? 

Thank you very much for your help.

Mojtaba,

I find it helpful to start off with the Design Development Wizard.  Go
to the main Project Navigator window, and there you'll find a Bldg Shell
Components section.  You can create new shells, edit, or delete.  These
are the separate floors for your building.

Select Create New Shell, and go to Window 2 (2 of 25).  Click on the
drop down for Footprint and select -custom- and follow the directions on
importing your CAD file.  Make sure the CAD file is saved as a R14
version.  You'll have to play around with things from here, but that's
about it.

Once you have your footprint mapped out, then layout your zones.  Follow
the similar procedure for importing the CAD file and zoning it.
Remember you need to go in counterclockwise to map a zone (you'll see).

Regarding a curved wall, to my knowledge, eQUEST can't model curves
exactly, but can very closely by connecting a number of small segments
together to mimic the curve.  Should be a good enough approximation.

Hope this works out for you.  If this is your first time importing CAD
and laying out the zones, give yourself a some time to get used to it
and try out the different features.  Very useful stuff overall.

EIR can definitely be changed in the detailed mode, and also in
parametric runs.

 

COP is converted into "Cooling Electric Input Ratio" or EIR values for
both chillers and for DX cooling.  (See basic chiller screen and
cooling-unitary power screen)

EIR = 1/COP 

EIR = 1/(EER/3.413)

Ok, so I have just noticed:

A comparison between the SS-M report of the baseline (no erv) and ERV models
shows that the ERV uses a little more fan energy for heating and cooling
modes (this seems reasonable) and then a HUGE amount more during floating
hours.

This is what I have input (through a parametric run) for ERV's

   ERV-RECOVER-TYPE = ENTHALPY-WHEEL
   ERV-RUN-CTRL     = WHEN-MIN-OA
   ERV-CAP-CTRL     = MODULATE-HX
   ERV-FANS         = HVAC-SUPPLY/RETURN
   ERV-FAN-EFF      = 0.9
   ERV-MOTOR-CLASS  = PREMIUM
   ERV-OA-KW/FLOW   = 8.5e-005
   ERV-FROST-CTRL   = USE-CAP-CTRL

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709110833.AA3332890pd80001490450@gard.com>

I was wondering if anyone knew how to input COP and SEER values in the
Detailed Data Edit Mode? I am comparing design variations for a building
and am just changing the values from the first file rather than
inputting everything all over again in a new file. Can I change the COP
and SEER values in the Detailed Data Edit Mode or do I have to go back
to the Building Creation Wizard to accomplish this? 

 

Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709110825.AA2523468pd80001490398@gard.com>

Ok, so there have been a couple post recently asking about energy savings
from ERV's in eQuest.  The concern is that there is some reduction in
cooling and heating energy use, but a significant increase in fan energy
use.

Here's my thought:  in the baseline case, the only energy expended with
respect to ventilation air is the energy required to heat and cool the
outdoor air, but the fan energy to move the ventilation air through ductwork
is not represented.  (If someone knows where to put this number, or how to
represent it, please let me know).  Any other thoughts/suggestions out
there?

I am trying to get to the bottom of this as well, because so far, according
to eQuest, installing an ERV has not made much sense.

Also, is there a way to turn off the airside economizer?  I'm modeling a
building with heat pumps.  There is an ERV for ventilation, but no
economizer.

Thanks,
~Karen~

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709110802.AA0208734pd80001490324@gard.com>

That is my nightmare situation -- whether to go forward or backwards.
It is definitely easier to create zones in the wizard mode, but it can
certainly be done in the detailed mode.  The question is how many
changes have you done in detailed mode and how easily can they be
reincorporated if you go back to the wizard.

Path 1 - adding zone in wizard mode:
Save your current model with a new name.  Plant changes are easy to
reincorporate into the model -- you can go to the .inp file of your
current model in a text editor and save your boiler and chiller etc.
definitions as a separate (partial) .inp file and then import that
.inp file after you have added the zones in wizard mode.  You can do
the same with the air side equipment but it becomes trickier.  This is
the path I choose most often.

Path 2 - adding zone in detailed mode:
You may need to create the polygon to define the new space.  Then
define the space.  Add each of the walls (actually this is quicker
than you would expect using the "location" field -- the trick is
learning which vertex to associate each wall with).  Create the
thermal zone and associate it with the space. Possibly delete exterior
walls in adjacent spaces (or redefine their parent space to the new
space.  Possibly create interior partitions between the new and
existing spaces (I tend to be lazy and not create these unless there
is a significant temperature difference between them.)  

Use caution and go slow -- the above is certainly not a comprehensive
list, just thoughts that might help whichever way you go.  

Note that there is a neat list here:
 
http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/2006/11/equest-wizard-checklist.htm
l 
 of things to make sure of before making the jump from wizard to
detailed mode (not that that helps now!).

Good luck!

In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200709101530.AA3057500pd80003636503@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709110110.AA1030359pd80001490062@gard.com>

For the Chiller EIR input, below is the equation to calculate the EIR
based on the Part Load Ratio.  I am modeling air cooled chillers. 

 

What is "r1" and "dT" refer to?  I'm assuming that "r1" is the actual
cooling load divided by the maximum cooling capacity based on the
condenser temperature (ambient dry bulb temperature) and "dT" is the
difference between the chilled water supply and return temperature
(which is 10 with 44 supply and 54 return).  I'm getting numbers that
are extremely low especially for low PLRs.  I would think that the
maximum efficiency would be around 40-60% PLR but am not seeing this.

 

BI-QUADRATIC-RATIO&dT        The curve is bi-quadratic in 2 independent
variables. It has the form 

 

                                  f(r1,dT) = c1 + c2*r1 + c3*r12 + c4*dT
+ c5*dT2 + c6*r1*dT, 

 

                                  where c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, and c6 are
coefficients. R1 is a dimensionless variable. dT is a variable with
units of delta temperature.

Hello all, 

If I am already in detail mode but found out that a
periimeter zone should've been defined, do I have to
go back to wizard mode to create the perimeter zone?
Or can I do something in detail model to save all the
troubles? 

Thank you very much for your help.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709101626.AA2645390pd80001489895@gard.com>

Dear all,
   
  I am simulating a building energy performance with VAV and Fan Coil sytems, respectively. I need to add the water side economizer to the system. I found that I cannot add water side economizer when the system type is Fan Coil system (the selection is gray color and cannot modify) but I can add water-side economizer when the air system type is a VAV system. Does anyone know what is the problem with this issue?
   
  Thanks in advance.

I?m curious to know of the accuracy of daylighting when such situations arise.  I enjoy creating one space for the plenum and then making one ceiling and floor for each floor verse doing ceiling and floors for every space.  Please let me know if this will increase the inaccuracy of the daylighting calcs.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709101454.AA5436843pd80001489735@gard.com>

Hello,

I am using eQUEST to simulate a VAVS system. The system has a minimum
air schedule that is 100% at night and about 75% during the day. The
system has an economizer with outdoor air temperature control and
drybulb high limit at 70F. The system also has a sensible HX ERV, with
control operation set to When Minimum OA, make-up temp control set to
Mixed Air Reset, and capacity control set to Modulate HX. During the day
when outdoor air temperature exceeds return air temperature, the system
continues to use 100% outdoor air rather than using some return air. Can
anyone help resolve this problem?

With thanks,
Derek

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709101057.AA5742125pd80001489511@gard.com>

Hi,

 

1.	Export your glazing file from Window 5 and saving it as a doe.2 
2.	Open up a fresh (default) eQuest model, go into detailed mode
and save it. 
3.	Scroll down to "Glass Types" in the window on the left hand side
of your default eQuest model and right click so that it says "Import
Window4/5 Report file". There you can source and add your glazing file. 
4.	Save the default eQuest file you created
5.	Go into the resulting .inp file, copy the relevant glazing data
and paste it into your working eQuest model .inp file. 

 

I think it's safer to do this outside of your working eQuest file and
copy in so as to avoid corrupting your working file it if you get it
wrong. Hope this helps

 

Kevin Burke

i believe this question has been asked several times on this forum but never
been answered (at least i couldn't find it). i created a window 5 file that
i want to import into eQUEST.  i exported using 'report' from window 5 and
saved for doe2. doesnt work!could someone enlighten the 'real' protocol of
importing W5? thanks for all the inputs in advance

Sean,

For some reason I am unable to respond to the entire list so permit my
responding directly to you. 

 

Purple font normally indicates a linked copy, i.e., an object has been
linked to another object of the same type (do this via a right click on
the component tree... the master object must be above the linked object
on the component tree, regardless of what the pick list may suggest,
else you'll have BDL errors the next time you open the project). For any
keywords in the object that don't have user input (i.e., red font), a
default value is inherited from the master object to which the current
object is linked. 

 

Objects being fetched from the library are normally shown in a dark blue
font. You can't actually edit a library object but you are normally
allowed to edit a copy of the original in the library, i.e., upon edit,
a copy is automatically fetched from the library and most formerly dark
blue font items become red font items. It's OK to have an object in your
project INP file that bears the same name as an object in the library
since BDL first checks the INP file for the object before it looks into
the library. 

 

-Marlin Addison

Green is an eQUEST default

Red is a user-defined value

Pink is a user-defined expression

Blue is a user-defined default

Purple is an entry from eQUEST's library - this happens if you use, say,
a default component like a purple that you retrieve from the library.
You can change it (just get past the warning), but if you do, it will no
longer be treated as a library value - that is, it will no longer be
called up from the library each time you load the project.  Instead, it
will become a permanent part of your project.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709100835.AA3554687pd80001489168@gard.com>

All,
A current project I am working on specifies two chillers operating in
series.  The first chiller has an entering and leaving evaporator
temperature of 58F and 48.5F.  The second has an entering and leaving
evaporator temperature of 48.5F and 40F.   There is also a water side
economizer which causes an error when it is attached to either of the
CHW loops.

The DOE2 topics manual says series arrangements are not simulated, but
is it reasonable to define the two chillers on primary (58 to 48.5) and
secondary (48.5 to 48) loops and attach the loads to the secondary loop?
What about the water side economizer? Any thoughts or previous modeling
experience and commentary would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Sam Mason

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709091236.AA3610109pd80001488837@gard.com>

I'm working on a high rise multi-family building for LEED 2.2 with separate
electric water heaters (storage not instantaneous) in each residence unit.  

 

ASHRAE 90.1-2004 appears to provide a baseline efficiency factor of
0.93-0.00132V in table 7.8 for the smallest size range for electric water
heaters (V is storage in gallons).  

 

I also found reference at GAMA's site to a Federal minimum of 0.97-0.00132V
for residential electric storage water heaters apparently issued by US DOE
in October 1990.  

 

ASHRAE 90.1-2004 seems to apply to high rise multi-family water heaters.
Any opinions on the correct standard to apply to the LEED 2.2. baseline?

 

Thanks,

 

Brian Thornton

 Dear all,
   
  I am modelling an office building in the cold climate (Zone 7). The baseline case for ASHRAE 90.1-2004 is VAV system. To evaluate the effect of air system heat recovery, I add the ERV in the Outdoor Air/Heat Recovery 1&2 tab. I select the ERV type as Sensible Heat Exange with effective as 0.52, the control sequence set as "when minimum OA".
   
  However, the simulatio result I got is kind of weird, cooling, fan and pump energy increase a lot, while the heating energy use was reduced only around 6%. Could somebody tell me what maybe the problem casuing this weired results or how can I check whether the result is correct?
   
  Thanks a lot.
   
  Regards,
   
  David

Hi everyone,

 

This is my first time using E-Quest.  In the 3-D Geometry tab, my model
has somehow moved from being located at the center of the origin to
approximately 200ft SE of the origin.  It is not that huge of a deal but
it has made panning around in 3-D a hassle because 3-D orbiting is
focused on the center origin and my building.  Does anybody know what to
do in order to make the center of my building the 3-D origin again?    

 

Thank,

Dan,

Not sure about the colors, but the plenum occupancy can be fixed easily.
If you right click on the field and go to "edit/view user expression,"
you can change the value manually and override the default.  This can
also be completed by changing the value in the input file directly and
reloading the pd2 file.

approximately 200ft SE of the origin.  It is not that huge of a deal but it
has made panning around in 3-D a hassle because 3-D orbiting is focused on
the center origin and my building.  Does anybody know what to do in order to
make the center of my building the 3-D origin again?    

 

Thank,

Also, if the glass was reduced in an intelligent manner for your
location (reducing glass on the North, East, and West, for example),
the energy improvements will be shown when the baseline model is
rotated 90, 180 and 270 degrees.

Simple answer is that your client is incorrect. If the 100% CD documents
show that the WWR is 27% then that is the design. what if the architect
started at 35%, 29%, 65%??? All irrelevant.
 
You should be able to show savings if you still use a very high
performance glass and/or shading as the ASHRAE baseline glass
performance decreases with decreasing WWR - that is where you get
leverage.

Hello All, 
 
 I have a question that pertains to ASHRAE 90.1-2004, Appendix G, Table
G3.1, No.5, which details modeling requirements for calculating proposed
and baseline building performance for the building envelope.  I'd
appreciate any thoughts you all might have on this LEED modeling.  
 
 We are currently working with a client on a building with a window-wall
ratio of 27%. The WWR was reduced from 40% by the architect in order to
obtain higher energy cost savings. When building the baseline model,
Appendix G states: 
 
 "Vertical fenestration areas for new building and additions shall equal
that in the proposed design or 40% of gross above-grade wall area, which
ever is smaller..." 
 
 Our client believes that since in the schematic design, the WWR was
over 40% and was then reduced to below 27% for energy efficiency
reasons, the baseline building should be modeled with a 40% WWR to show
these savings due to architectural design. 
 
 I understand that the proposed design stated in Appendix G refers to
the building that is going to be built, or the 100% CD drawings.
However, our client wants to see the definition of "proposed design"
from ASHRAE that explicitly states what the proposed design is. After
researching for a while, I found Addendum A, which states on page 4 of
the Addendum: 
 
 G3.1 Proposed Design Model. The simulation model o f   
 the proposed design shall be consistent with the design documents, 
 including proper accounting of fenestration and 
 opaque envelope types and areas; 
 
 and: 
 
 G3.6 Building Envelope. All components of the building 
 envelope in the proposed design shall be modeled as shown on 
 architectural drawings or as built for existing building envelopes. 
 
 This still is not enough to accurately define the proposed design. I am
sure that you might  all agree with me on the interpretation of Appendix
G, but does anyone know where I can find a solid definition of what the
proposed design is? I have searched the CIRs on the USGBC website and
came up empty handed and don't know where else to go. ASHRAE said a
formal interpretation request could take upwards of 6 months, so that is
also out of the question .  
 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

As far as the standard goes, I think the key point here is that the
baseline building evolves in the tables and sections from the proposed
building.  So once the proposed building changes, the baseline reacts.
Not the other way around.  

 

The real building to be built is where everything is derived from.
Prior incarnations of the design are no longer "proposed" - they have
been "eliminated".  Feel free to make quotation marks with your fingers
when you mention this.

 

So as far as a definition, how about Dictionary.com:
http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/proposed

 

1.to offer or suggest (a matter, subject, case, etc.) for consideration,
acceptance, or action: to propose a new method.

 

At this point in time you would be using antonym #1, "withdraw" to
describe the 40% WWR case.

 

Standard 90.1 doesn't cover withdrawn designs, only proposed ones.  No
energy code for paper projects, only the ones submitted to be
constructed (and subject to section 4.1 and 4.2 of course!)

Brandon:
 
As promised, I post following instruction for obtaining the heat pump library. 
 
The heat pump library and other associated files for eQUEST to access the library are packaged in a self-extracted zip file, which can be downloaded at  <http://www.climatemaster.com/index/equest> http://www.climatemaster.com/index/equest after proper registration. In addition to the heat pump library, the standard release of eQUEST 3.6 and an eQUEST training handout focused on the enhanced GSHP simulation and the heat pump library can also to downloaded. In order to access the heat pump library directly from eQUEST wizard, the self-extracted zip file has to be unzipped over the installation of eQUEST. The instruction for unzipping the file is shown in the above web page. The procedure for selecting a heat pump from the library is described in slides 77-84 of the training handout. 
 
As an add-on feature, the heat pump library can be accessed by eQUEST starting from version 3.6.  
 
When you register, please make sure mentioning "RE: [BLDG-SIM] Trouble with Heat Pumps (eQuest)" in the text box for comment. Since the downloading request is still handled manually, it may take a few days for us to verify your registration and send you a link for downloading.
 
Hope it could be a small help for your simulation.

Karen:
 
If you create a heat pump system using eQUEST wizard, in the first screen of the wizard system (after you specifying both cooling and heating equipment as "DX Coil"), an additional input entry will appear and ask you specify the source of the heat pump. The available options include "Air", "Water Loop", and "Ground Loop". When "Water Loop" is selected, the HVAC system will be defined a water loop heat pump (WLHP) system (with boiler and cooling tower); When "Ground Loop" is selected, the HVAC system will be defined as a ground source heat pump (GSHP) system that uses water-to-air heat pumps connected to a common (water) loop and a vertical borehole field as heat sink and source.
 
I'm not clear why you have to deal with HIR for WLHP and GSHP systems since these heat pumps are electric-driven. I guess you were talking about the EIR instead of HIR.
 
The PVVT is used to simulate the air side of a water-to-air heat pump so that it can account for the recent developments of water-to-air heat pump, such as the usage of staged compressor, variable speed fan, etc. If the WLHP/GSHP is created with the eQUEST wizard, parameters associated with the PVVT system will be automatically set for constant air flow, and default WLHP/GSHP heat pump performance curves will be used. The default curves are normalized at the ARI rating conditions for "ground loop" application (77F EFT for cooling and 32F EFT for heating). If the WSHP/GSHP is created in detailed mode, at this version of eQUEST, the user has to adjust the parameters of PVVT to fit for the specific heat pumps being simulated. I've listed some necessary adjustments for the parameters of PVVT in my earlier post to the topic "Gshp in detailed edit mode".
 
FYI, a performance data/curve library for all the water-to-air heat pumps of a major water-source heat pump manufacturer has been built and, as an add-on feature of eQUEST, it can be accessed directly from the wizard of "Packaged Equipment" if either WLHP or GSHP is specified. Please let me know if you are interested in the library and this add-on feature.
 
Hope it helps in your simulation.

Thanks for all the responses.  I think I figured it out:
 
When you choose "WLHP" in the eQuest Wizard, it creates a PVVT system with a GSHP.  The curve used to adjust HIR is based on a few data points, and did not perform very well at the temperatures I was using.  A straight HP system selected in detailed edit mode did much better.  I now realize that this is because the HIR curve was better for my purposes.  I have now created curves based on the heat pumps spec'd for this job and the numbers are making more sense. 
 
Thanks again for all the repsonses, thought I'd let everyone know, especially because PVVT is what is selected when you create a WLHP system with the wizard, and may need some detailed data edit tweaking.

Have you adjusted your heat pomp efficiencies?  Ground and water source heat pumps will have different efficiencies, if for no other reason than they are operating with different condenser water temperatures.

I apologize for all the emails I've sent out as of late.  Thanks for all the input.
 
I have another:
 
I'm comparing a ground source heat pump to a heat pump loop with chiller and boiler.  Trouble is, when I switch systems, the energy used by the heat pump to heat the space goes down only slightly as compared to the energy input by the boiler.  My loop temperatures change between the systems (from heating temp of 40 F to 70 F), and COP rises accordingly.  Right now the energy use of the two systems is off by about 85%!! 
 
Energy use for straight electric resistance heat is about the same as the electric use for a heat pump system.  This is for a baseline model with 18% evenly distributed windows, R-19 batt insulation, R-38 ceilings, etc. 
 
I used the wizard to set up the equipment for all runs (I'm also having trouble in detailed edit mode).  The water loop and the heat pump don't seem to be talking to one another.  Can anyone help?
 
Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709061527.AA272078pd80001487386@gard.com>

I'm attempting to model a raised clerestory for daylighting purposes,
and I'm having trouble with the physical description.  The building in
question has several raised sections, much like skylight wells, with
vertically mounted windows on either side to produce daylight to the
zone below rather than horizontally mounted skylights.  eQUEST does
allow for skylight wells, but in doing so the assumption is that the
skylight is horizontally mounted.  In addition, I attempted to create an
additional shell for the skylight wells allowing manual placement of
vertically mounted windows, but it appears that the "Open to Below" and
"Multi-Level Space" checkboxes in the wizard function do not apply to
daylighting effects.  Is there a better way to model side mounted
skylights in a core zone?
 
Thanks,

1 Bad Building Component exists. 

 

When I click on the Building Description button to find out what the
error is, it reads:

 

SYSTEM EL1 Sys1 (PVAVS) (G.WNW1) has no CONDITIONED ZONE - one is
required.

 

I triple checked the conditioned/unconditioned zone assignments and they
are all correct.

 

Does anyone know what might else be causing the error??

 

Thanks,

Dan,
I usually start off with right clicking in the viewport and resetting
the view (this doesn't fix it though). Next I cycling through selecting
the Utility and Economics, Airside, and Water-side edit tabs until I
return to the Building Shell tab. That usually does the trick for me.

Hi - I had the same problem and found this in the archives. I tried it and
it works:

 

"Open the ".pd2" file of the project in a text editor (notepad/note tab
lite).
Check the coordinates of 'ClippingRange', 'FocalPoint' &
'Position'...If any of these coordinates don't seem all right then modify
to some positive values...save the file and then open the project in
eQUEST."

 

I have found that sometimes these coordinates are in the negative billions.
How this happens I have no clue.

Sir:

If you start your building in the Design Development (DD) Wizard, you
can input your unique floor by floor building footprint, then define up
to three window types (could be same glass and different window
dimensions). Each "building shell component" (read: floor) can have its
own unique windows, pct.in each facing direction, etc. I don't think you
can have different window dimensions on a particular floor/facing
directions using either the Schematic or DD Wizard.

But I believe you could have, say, store front 8 x 10 glass on Floor 1
facing south, and different glass and dimensions in EACH other facing
direction. Floor 2 can be entirely different.

You can play with the window dimension as well to achieve, say 5 windows
in a facing direction vs. 8 windows (if you need to achieve some
symmetry). 

Otherwise, Custom Window Placement gets the job done, abet slowly.

Hello

I was wondering if there is a quick and easy way to input an array of
windows using eQUEST.  Using the custom window placement, or using a
copy and paste method in the .bdl file works but both methods are
cumbersome.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709051145.AA4509187pd80001486320@gard.com>

Training workshop ? 
\"ENERGYPLUS\"
EnergyPlus is a state of an art building energy simulation software developed by U.S. Department of Energy in collaboration with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, National Renewable Energy Laboratory and several universities. &nbsp; EnergyPlus models building heating, cooling, lighting, ventilation, and electrical, water and other energy flows. While it is based on the most popular features and capabilities of BLAST and DOE-2, it includes many innovative simulation capabilities such as time steps of less than an hour, modular systems and plant integrated with heat balance-based zone simulation, multi zone air flow, thermal comfort, and combined heat and power and photovoltaic systems. 


Importance of Energy Simulation and Energy Modeling tools for commercial buildings has increased by an order of magnitude with the launch of Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) by Bureau of Energy Efficiency. Architectural and Environmental Design Consulting firms are required to model commercial buildings to show compliance with ECBC. At the same time there are very few firms in India with this specialized knowledge and expertise. This workshop offers a unique opportunity to learn about &nbsp; (a) The concepts of energy simulation&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) State-of-the-art building energy simulation software - EnergyPlus 

The skill that architects, consultants, and academicians will learn during this workshop is in tremendous demand because of the unprecedented growth experienced by commercial building sector in India. This workshop will also allow them to develop energy simulation models needed to show compliance with ECBC and LEED rating system. 

The objective of this workshop is to introduce EnergyPlus to modelers who are familiar with the basic concepts of building physics &amp; HVAC systems. The course will cover the mechanics of the building using EnergyPlus with an emphasis on basic concepts that provide a foundation for more advanced applications. Participants will model basic building envelopes and systems using the latest version of EnergyPlus on their own laptop computers. Time for questions and answers will be provided for each topic. The course outline is listed below. This is non residential training workshop.
 

Target Audience 
- Architects designing ECBC compliant and green buildings. 
- Energy analysts for ECBC compliant and green buildings.

Fred,
(90.1-2004)Appendix G, table G3.1, section 5 on right side under
baseline opaque assemblies, for floor it says to model as steel joist.
So yes, by modeling your proposed design with concrete you do get the
benefit of MASS.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Interior Thermal mass in App G baseline



Does anyone have an opinion, or sense of the intent on the following: 

  

App G is fairly clear that the baseline EXTERIOR walls are
"lightweight," and metal-framed. Floors & walls are mentioned, but
referenced to exterior ENVELOPE constructions and U-factors. 

  

The U-M states the "baseline building is assumed to be steel-framed,"
but then goes on to state "if the proposed building has thermal mass in
the EXTERIOR construction... then the mass is credited." 

  

So, if a proposed building has poured concrete frame and floors,
can/should the baseline building be modeled with "light weight," "steel
joist" interior floors? Or is this a characteristic which is not
specifically defined for the baseline, and thus the baseline should be
the same as the proposed?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709050930.AA3059687pd80001486058@gard.com>

Hello-

I had a question about heating of unenclosed spaces and how it relates
to LEED modeling.  I am modeling a sporting complex that has a driving
range.  These "unenclosed" driving range spaces are heated.  In ASHRAE
90.1-2004 it says all unenclosed spaces need to be radiantly heated.
For the baseline LEED model should this heating element be included or
not?  Thanks,

read section B1 of appendix B it talks about how to determine climate
zones for international locations not listed.  that should do the trick.

I have not done this, and you may want to check the CIRs, but in ASHRAE
90.1-2004 on pages 118- 120, there is some information about climate
zones for international locations.  Pages 118-119 has Table B-3,
International climate zones and lists climate zones for a limited number
of international locations.  You may be able to find something close to
your location.  On page 120, there is a list of climate zones and their
corresponding criteria.  If you have HDD, CDD50, and major climate type
definition (see page 109), you should be able to make a decision as to
what climate zone your building falls under. 

I'm not sure how to find weather data files for international sites.  I
know there have been some posts about this recently.

You may want to submit a CIR for anything that does not fall directly
under ASHRAE guidelines.

All,
 
What is the best way to tell, directly or indirectly, if eQuest
calculations (i.e. results) are reflective of the latest changes to the
input files?  
 
It would be nice if there was a flag in the user interface somewhere
(e.g. Trace) -- the only method that comes to mind is comparing file
save date and times from the baseline file vs. the parametric runs.
 
 
Thanks...

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200709041656.AA5652796pd80001485674@gard.com>

Does anyone have an opinion, or sense of the intent on the following:

 

App G is fairly clear that the baseline EXTERIOR walls are
"lightweight," and metal-framed. Floors & walls are mentioned, but
referenced to exterior ENVELOPE constructions and U-factors. 

 

The U-M states the "baseline building is assumed to be steel-framed,"
but then goes on to state "if the proposed building has thermal mass in
the EXTERIOR construction? then the mass is credited."

 

So, if a proposed building has poured concrete frame and floors,
can/should the baseline building be modeled with "light weight," "steel
joist" interior floors? Or is this a characteristic which is not
specifically defined for the baseline, and thus the baseline should be
the same as the proposed?

Dear all,

Has anybody modeled a building outside the US for LEED energy performance
credits? How does comparing the baseline and proposed designs work, the
climate zones in ASHRAE 90.1 being limited to the US?

Everyone,

 

I am continuously having problems with E-Quest when trying to use the
Building Creation Wizard to create new doors and windows. E-Quest
crashes when I am using the Custom Window/Door placement tool. Does
anyone know how to avoid this problem while still being able to place
windows and doors??

it, neither using these keywords in the input file directly works. Is
U-eff still the way to go?
