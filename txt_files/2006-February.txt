Brian,
 
I think the answer is "it all depends."  I would be much more specific
about what your client is aiming for. There are many levels of
robustness that you can deal with - anything from on-site
self-production of all site consumed energy to simply purchasing
renewable energy credits from others to offset your usage to even going
beyond site energy consumption and looking at overall project energy
consumption with transport impacts, source energy conversion
efficiencies, etc. It is important to draw the line clearly and clearly
define what you are setting out to do. It is easy to get carried away
and also easy to overlook/ignore large impacts that may set your client
up for a PR disaster. For example, I opened a book up on "off-grid"
homes and saw a house in NYC - I was intrigued, but then disappointed to
know that it wasn't off-grid urban, it was just a house in NYC with a
few PV panels on the roof that met a portion of their electric demand.
Be careful when using vaguely defined terms like "net zero" - net zero
what? You could have net zero site emissions by using all electric
systems...
 
Carbon neutrality is an area where bio-fuels can work if you consider
that they are long-term carbon neutral.  It all depends on your and your
client's definition of what they are trying to do.
 
Peter

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200602271924.AA240346pd80001002562@gard.com>

Dear Group,

Am I on a correct direction? Any comments are welcome
- - 

I am comparing two ventilation strategies for comfort
control in a Theatre. Option 1 uses air side
economizer (EC) only. Option 2 uses DCV integrated
with EC.
The design OA flow rate is 15cfm/person; and it gets
upto 40% of design flow. If I trust the simulation
(eQuest), DCV+EC has higher electricity use (for space
cooling), and much lower gas use than EC.

My guess for higher electricity use of DCV+EC is in
the simulaiton, the specification of outside air ratio
is pre-occupied by DCV, which set much low outside air
ratio in the mornings in summer, so it used more
electricity to cool the space. DCV+EC reduces cold
outside air in all hours in winter, that agrees with
EC, so it reduced gas use to heat the space.

In eQuest, when I set a MIN_AIR_SCH according to
occupancy ratio, then the EC strategy seem to be
bypassed. Are there any way to optimze DCV+EC in
eQuest? i.e. to turn high outside air volume in the
mornings in summer, turn low in the afternoons when
the theatre is occupied and outside is warmer?

Thank you very much!

Danni Wang

We have just published two new datasets in EnergyPlus/ESP-r format on the
web site:
http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data.cfm

Chinese Standard Weather Data (CSWD)
A set of 270 typical year weather files for locations throughout China,
developed Tsinghua University and China Meteorological Bureau.


Kuwait Weather Data from Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR)
Two weather files for Kuwait based on measured meteorological data for
Kuwait International Airport and KISR's coastal weather station.


This brings the total number of weather data locations available on the web
site to more than 1100 (some locations have multiple sources of data).
More information about both data sources are available here:
http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_sources.html


As always if you know of typical weather data that we could share with
other users, please contact the EnergyPlus team.

Dear all,

it is my pleasure to announce the first local IBPSA-Germany conference "BauSIM 2006" held in Munich from October 9-11,
2006 at the Munich Technical University (TUM) and to call for participation. The official conference language is German;
presentations in English are welcome.

The conference is in alignment with the common IBPSA topics. Emphasis is placed on the topic "Energy efficiency in
building design and thermal comfort in rooms". BauSIM2006 shall bring together practitioners, researchers and
developers. Part of the conference will be an exhibition on building services and simulation tools.

Deadline for submitting abstracts is April 30, 2006. A number of selected contributions will be subject to a publication
in the journal BAUPHYSIK (publisher: Ernst&Sohn).

The scientific committee is composed of members from Austria and Germany. Locally, the event is organized by five
university chairs from the faculties of architecture and civil and environmental engineering at TUM.

Please find all related information on our web site (currently in German, English version under construction):

Another insulation question while we are on the subject - how have people
taken into account the loss in insulation from roof drain locations when
calculating the average insulation level of a rigid roofs? Is there an
established protocol, paper, or anything to reference on this topic? 
Thank you,

google on LTTR (long term thermal resistance); products which use air as a
blowing agent do not change in r-value due to outgassing; some argue that
hermetically sealed insulations (encased in metal in one example) cannot
outgas and retain their initial high R-value, but a perfect seal or delayed

	Does thermal conductivity of polyisocyanurate roof insulation change
over time? 
	Will the R-value decrease over time? There seems to be conflicting
information about this.

Hi Irene:

Not sure what you mean by thermal buffing, but if you
specify an unconditioned atrium adjacent to a
conditioned space, at least the mean Unconditioned
space temp will affect the Chem Lab. No stratification
effects can be modeled, however.

Insulation ValuesYes it does.There is a rapid (on the order of months) change as air diffuses in. A longer change occurs as the blowing agent diffuses out. Some manufacturers give the R value after a certain time period.

EnergyPlus with the COMIS link should be reasonable for this. You can
input basic control strategies for the opening and closing of windows.
Beware that wind pressure coefficiencts in a huge unknown. You may want
to run it both with and without wind effects to see the difference. As
far as zone temperatures go, it is usually conservative to leave the
wind-induced ventilation out.

Hi everyone
 
I am looking for a software by which be able to simulate a house as free

a particular zone. The main issue is the flexibility of the software
that allows me to open and close windows/ doors, periodically, in a
particular zone for a duration of one week to see how this (naturally

Any information would be greatly appreciated

Note that TRYNSYS is expensive.  Other possibilities include esp-r (free) 
and Ecotect (around $800 US).
Ecotect is flexible and fairly easy to use.  esp-r has a fairly steep 
learning curve.

Hey, does anyone know whether it is possible to run a compliance analysis

The errors I am getting right now, when running the title 24 compliance, is
on the chilled water and hot water loops (something about intermediate

Any help would be greatly appreciated...

Maria,
   TRNSYS includes a component that links thermal building simulations with 
a free airflow modeling package called CONTAM. TRNSYS also has (non 
standard, commercially available) links with another airflow modeling 
package called COMIS. Please let me know if you would like additional 
details and I can send them to you directly.
Kind regards,
  David

The grand old beastie of natural ventilation simulation within
buildings is ESP-r (http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk). A brief
summary:

a) It has been doing buildling-coupled mass flow simulation for
    more than a decade, it is stable and mature and can
    work with complex networks (e.g. multiple unconnected
    buildings) with simulation timesteps down to one minute.
    A conservative count is that hundreds of models with
    flow networks have been created in the ESP-r community, 
    I've probably done 50-60 of them myself. 
    
    For many ESP-r  users natural and/or
    hybrid ventilation is nothing at all special (although some
    novices have spotted the occassional fire-breathing dragon).

b) It compares well with COMIS and CONTAM but with full
    thermal coupling of the predicted mass flows with the
    zone thermal solver and as well as coupled to a CFD
    domain for even higher resolution.

c) You can control window openings and doors and fans
    based on a variety of sensed conditions including CO2
    levels. It has bi-directional flow components for doors as well
    as all the usual suspects.

d) It comes with facilities to graph and export and report
    on what is happening in the flow network (as well as
    everything else in the simulation) so you can find out
    not only where and when flow occurred, but the energy
    implications of that flow.

e) ESP-r runs on just about every type of computer and
    operating system. It is GPLed so you can look at the
    code and add in your own components. The download
    page has both the source as well as pre-compiled
    binaries for various platforms.

Hi Pedro,

You may want to take a look at COMIS. You will find a free demo version 
here :

http://software.cstb.fr/main/home_vl.asp?context=&langue=us

(it's the event of the month on the homepage ;-)

COMIS can also be easily coupled with TRNSYS.

Hi all.
I need to estimate the coupling air flow between two thermal zones that 
have a common door that is always opened. This air flow will be used for 
building simulations.
How can I estimate this parameter or, at least, a mean value that will 
be accurate for the simulations?
Thanks in advance,

Pedro,

I would suggest to use CONTAMW instead. It is multizone airflow and 
contaminant transport analysis software. It is downloadable at no cost from 
the following web link:
http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/IAQanalysis/

In my recent research I compared results from AIOLOS with simple hand calcs 
and I found that AIOLOS reports higher air changes per hour. Moreover, it is 
not available online nor has been updated for a long time.


Best regards,

Gaurav Mehta

Hello,

a quite old reference treating of buoyancy driven ventilation through 
indoor openings is

G.N. Walton, A computer algorithm for predicting infiltration and 
interroom airflows/, //ASHRAE Transactions/ 90,  Part 1, 1984, 601-610


The large opening is considered as two small ones on which power law 
apply, with specific parameters (exponent, height, discharge 
coefficient). It is adapated to multizone airflow modelling and allows 
the couplings with wind induced ventilation.

Another one is considering laminar airflow solved with Bernouilli equation

Van Der Maas, J.* */Air flow through large openings buildings./ 
Lausanne: International Energy Agency Annex 20 substask 2 technical 
report, LESO-PB, EPFL, 1992.


In this one, through a doorway (with usual notations), a simplified 
expression (in kg/s) is proposed

 

I remember to have check the two previous methods and that they give 
nearly same results.

CODYRUN, the simulation software I developped (in French), with airflow 
module (pressure model with Walton's model of large openings), could be 
usefull for your needs. Keep in touch if interessed.

Hi everyone
   
  I am looking for a software by which be able to simulate a house as free running(naturally ventilated). I need to get the hourly temperatures of a particular zone. The main issue is the flexibility of the software that allows me to open and close windows/ doors, periodically, in a particular zone for a duration of one week to see how this (naturally ventilation) affect the thermal performance of a free running zone.
   
  Any information would be greatly appreciated

Try using AIOLOS

This might help straighten out the initial assumptions, to used for further

Hi everyone...is there any documentation on running the eQuest compliance

I have never used this tool and when trying to run the compliance it gives
me a bunch of error messages (something with the sub areas not being greater

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi all.
I need to estimate the coupling air flow between two
thermal zones that have a common door that is always
opened. This air flow will be used for building
simulations.
How can I estimate this parameter or, at least, a mean
value that will be accurate for the simulations?
Thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200602221314.AA1444656pd80000996552@gard.com>

I am modeling a hotel building on eQuest based on actual measured hourly
load data for chiller and boilers over the past few years. The way I am
modeling it is putting in the hourly load data as process load on the
chilled water and hot water loops. I have a dummy zone with no loads for
the air-side. The problem I am having by modeling it this way is the
chilled water temperature cannot be reset as there is process load
scheduled every hour of the year. Is there a way to move the process
load (as SOURCE-POWER) into the dummy zone and reset the CHW temperature
with the load in the zone? The issue I am having with doing that is the
additional air-side energy consumption for the dummy zone.

 

Thank you,

Sarathy Narasimhan

The espace wall is default to "Interior." As such, the program is
expecting to have adjacency spaces. You have to change the wall property
to external wall first.

Hi,

I created a single box building with six surfaces in ABS and add espace

surface does not have an adjacent set" . 

Any ideas?

Autodesk does not support vertical adjacencies.  In other words, there

On the other hand, GBS requires adjacencies to be defined for the model
to run.  For many models the results would be sufficiently accurate if
internal partitions were treated as adiabatic.  If GBS had a switch to
ignore vertical adjacencies and insert adiabatic partition instead, ABS
and GBS would work together.  

 

In conclusion, ABS epaces and GBS do not work together for multi story
buildings because of the vertical adjacency problem.  Single floor
buildings should work although you have to be careful with the internal
load definitions because all the ABS values get pulled into the GBS
model.

Hi there, I have a question regarding to converting GBXML from ABS to
GBS. GBS keep giving me error messages such as "Surface id= su13_Floor,
an InteriorFloor, should have two spaces adjacent to it. It has 1
defined." As such, I constructed a test run with only 1 espace on first
level and 1 espace on second level. The second level espace is perfectly
line up above the first level espace. The error message remains with the
second level spaces' floor type set to "Interior Space." The error
message only goes away when the floor type is changed to "Raised Floor."
However, I thought "raised floor" is referring to under floor
distribution. Does Autodesk has different terminology? Is it the right
setting for slab to slab construction?  If not, what other possibility
for the error?

 

Also, from my other test run, I found out that if the space has partial
roof, it needs to be separated by two espaces.

 

Many thanks!!!!!

Hi Joe,
I am very happy about the fast response to my problem. As you said I will modify the 10 missing hours for Melbourne directly in the IWEC new file. I will also get a new disk from ASHRAE.

Objet : [BLDG-SIM] Problems with IWEC weather files packed for DOE-2 (was Problem with Melbourne weather file)


After looking into Laurier's problem with the DOE-2 packed version of the IWEC weather file for Melbourne, I've determined the problem arises due to: (1) IWEC using the 9999 flag for missing pressures, and (2) the TMY2DCD routine in the DOE-2 weather packer (doewth) not checking for missing value flags and thus reading the 9999 flag literally as 9999 milibars. 
 
I then checked into all 225 DOE-2 packed IWEC files (*.bin), and found that 49 of them have occurences of the same problems, ranging from one such hour to extreme cases where presssure is missing (and thus interpreted on the *.bin files as 9999 millibars) for all 8760 hours. Assuming that others who have "packed" IWEC for DOE-2 used the same method as I, i.e., modifying the IWEC files to TMY2 format and then packing them as TMY2 files, be warned that many of these files will have bogus pressures. 
 
I am in the process of modifying doewth to take care of this glitch, either by interpolating between the closest available pressure recordings, or simply using a default pressure based on the station elevation, but wanted to warn people as soon as possible.  I will update BLDG-SIM when this patch is completed.

The IWEC file for Melbourne (Australia) has a major problem with the atmospheric pressure in June and July. 

The file is idenified as 948660.IWC 

The pressure is not according to the standardized IWEC fromat. The value is 9999 instead of hundreds of Pascal 

The file I have is from the disk of IWEC files from ASHRAE. This disk was purchase 3 to 4 years ago. 

It took several hours to find the cause of erronous results from DOE-2 simulations. 

Please let me know if this problem was solved for the available files from Energyplus. 

Let me know also if anybody found other problems with any of the IWEC weather files.

    Hi there, I have a question   regarding to converting GBXML from ABS to GBS. GBS keep giving me error messages   such as ?Surface id= su13_Floor, an InteriorFloor, should have two spaces   adjacent to it. It has 1 defined.? As such, I constructed a test run with only 1   espace on first level and 1 espace on second level. The second level espace is   perfectly line up above the first level espace. The error message remains with   the second level spaces? floor type set to ?Interior Space.? The error message   only goes away when the floor type is changed to ?Raised Floor.? However, I   thought ?raised floor? is referring to under floor distribution. Does Autodesk   has different terminology? Is it the right setting for slab to slab   construction?  If not, what other possibility for the   error?
   
  Also, from my other test run, I   found out that if the space has partial roof, it needs to be separated by two   espaces.
   
  Many   thanks!!!!!
   
  Yury   Lui

Problem with Melbourne weather fileAfter looking into Laurier's problem with the DOE-2 packed version of the IWEC weather file for Melbourne, I've determined the problem arises due to: (1) IWEC using the 9999 flag for missing pressures, and (2) the TMY2DCD routine in the DOE-2 weather packer (doewth) not checking for missing value flags and thus reading the 9999 flag literally as 9999 milibars. 

I then checked into all 225 DOE-2 packed IWEC files (*.bin), and found that 49 of them have occurences of the same problems, ranging from one such hour to extreme cases where presssure is missing (and thus interpreted on the *.bin files as 9999 millibars) for all 8760 hours. Assuming that others who have "packed" IWEC for DOE-2 used the same method as I, i.e., modifying the IWEC files to TMY2 format and then packing them as TMY2 files, be warned that many of these files will have bogus pressures. 

I am in the process of modifying doewth to take care of this glitch, either by interpolating between the closest available pressure recordings, or simply using a default pressure based on the station elevation, but wanted to warn people as soon as possible.  I will update BLDG-SIM when this patch is completed.

  The IWEC file for Melbourne (Australia) has a major problem with the atmospheric pressure in June and July. 

  The file is idenified as 948660.IWC 

  The pressure is not according to the standardized IWEC fromat. The value is 9999 instead of hundreds of Pascal 

  The file I have is from the disk of IWEC files from ASHRAE. This disk was purchase 3 to 4 years ago. 

  It took several hours to find the cause of erronous results from DOE-2 simulations. 

  Please let me know if this problem was solved for the available files from Energyplus. 

  Let me know also if anybody found other problems with any of the IWEC weather files.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200602211716.AA1618812pd80000995342@gard.com>

I am modeling a chilled water loop powered by an 1-stage absorption
chiller. The chiller input is steam from a steam boiler. When I run the
loop in standby mode and also in demand only mode, during non-cooling
hours, a large amount of heat input is simulated. Based on the
definition of "DEMAND" operation mode, the chiller is supposed to be
active only when the systems are in cooling mode. My system fans are
operational 24x7 (constant volume, 100% OA system - old hospital) -
which makes DEMAND and STANDBY operations the same. I am not sure if I
am modeling it right. I want to model a constant volume 100% OA reheat
fan system with a cooling coil on the chilled water loop and a heating
coil on the hot water loop powered by the same steam generator. Any help
will be greatly appreciated.

 

Thank you,

Renee,

If Peter's suggestion doesn't help the problem may be in the way eQuest handles user specified airflows.  eQuest assumes that the airflow you have entered is at sea level conditions and it automatically adjusts the airflow rate to account for the elevation of the project.  I know of two ways to deal with this, one ignore the fact the project is at elevation and enter a project elevation of zero or calculate the density correction factor and divide your design cfm by this amount before you enter it into equest. I suggest the later.

You can't really model displacement ventilation in equest because you cannot simulate the temperature stratification that occurs.  However with some effort you can create a model that gives reasonable results.  I suggest you read the paper written by Marlin Addison on the subject which I think is available on the www.DOE2.com website.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Displacement ventilation and airflow modeling in eQuest


Greetings,

For a middle school in Colorado, I'm modeling a constant volume displacement ventilation system and comparing this to a conventional variable air volume with reheat overhead system.

I cannot seem to set an exact total AHU airflow rate that has been calculated by the mechanical design engineer. When I do this, the eQuest program adds about 15% of airflow to the AHU airflow rate I specified. I specified at the zone and at the system level and each time, it increases the total airflow rate, even when I remove the exhaust airflow. Has anyone had this happen to them before? I did set the altitude to zero since that is what you are supposed to do if you want to put in exact airflow rates.

The number of hours outside the throttling range for the displacement system is very high since the temperature entering the space is a constant 68 F and the setpoint for the room is 70 F. The baseboard sizes have been entered and are maximized for the exterior wall. If I change the plenum height to anything above six feet being plenum, then part of my windows will be in the plenum which eQuest has a problem with. I have put in all the possible mechanical design parameters of the two types of systems into eQuest, except the fact that one is entering in overhead and one system is entering into the space at the floor level. I'm not sure if it is reasonable to assume that it is modeled correctly with many unmet hours of heating. But perhaps it is due to the limitations of modeling this type of system? Has anyone effectively estimated the performance of displacement ventilation in eQuest such that it is as designed without many unmet heating hours?

Also, just for some background, there is no cooling - cooling is provided only by an economizer cycle as they have summers off and the school is in the mountains.

Any suggestions to either of these issues would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you,

Ren?e

I would have thought that setting COND-FLOW-TYPE to FIXED-FLOW for all
heat pump units would result in the same pumping energy as setting the
CIRC-PUMP-TYPE to FIXED-FLOW, since the DOE Supplement suggests (to me
at least) that valve flow control through the heat pump units is the
only flow reduction mechanism in the model, yet my current model results
suggest otherwise. Am I missing something?

Renee - check your system sizing variable. I believe it defaults to 1.15, which explains your 15% oversizing. If you set your airflow and set this to 1.00 then you should be set.

Problem with Melbourne weather fileLaurier,

I took a look at my copy of the Melbourne IWEC weather file, and did not find any anomalies with the pressures in June or July.  You may be using an outdated version of the IWEC weather file, because I recall there were some glitches that were caught after the initial release of the data.  If so, I'm sure that the ASHRAE Bookstore will be able to replace your CD with the current one.  In any case, I will send you via separate e-mail my copy of the Melbourne weather file, packed for DOE-2.

Problem with Melbourne weather fileLaurier,

I took a look at my copy of the Melbourne IWEC weather file, and did not find any anomalies with the pressures in June or July.  You may be using an outdated version of the IWEC weather file, because I recall there were some glitches that were caught after the initial release of the data.  If so, I'm sure that the ASHRAE Bookstore will be able to replace your CD with the current one.  In any case, I will send you via separate e-mail my copy of the Melbourne weather file, packed for DOE-2.

  The IWEC file for Melbourne (Australia) has a major problem with the atmospheric pressure in June and July. 

  The file is idenified as 948660.IWC 

  The pressure is not according to the standardized IWEC fromat. The value is 9999 instead of hundreds of Pascal 

  The file I have is from the disk of IWEC files from ASHRAE. This disk was purchase 3 to 4 years ago. 

  It took several hours to find the cause of erronous results from DOE-2 simulations. 

  Please let me know if this problem was solved for the available files from Energyplus. 

  Let me know also if anybody found other problems with any of the IWEC weather files.

Use the DD wizard to create your model.  In the first screen of the 
shell editor, uncheck the box that says "Use Floor Multipliers".  This 
will make your model more complex and take longer to simulate, but the 
3D will look correct.  Much easier than the Photoshop solution.

I don't think you can do it using the SD wizard.

Renee, I have Adobe Photshop, but not the foggiest
idea as to how to apply it, as you suggest.

All right, you eQUEST magicians. Let's say I will produce a 10 story
building, but only describe the ground Floor, Top Floor and a Middle
Floor for which I will choose a multiplier.

The 3-d rendering will shoe only those three floors, with the top floor
magically suspended.

Without actually describing all 10 floors, is there ANY way to "fake"
some wall area or anything, to show it as a whole building?

SOMEONE has the answer...

one idea comes to mind - in a seperate file, you could make building shades for the walls in question, and separate fixed shades for windows and color code them the same way as the real walls, windows.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Displacement ventilation and airflow modeling in eQuest
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200602090910.AA105678pd80001433864@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200602181649.AA4933984pd80000991790@gard.com>

Greetings,

For a middle school in Colorado, I'm modeling a constant volume displacement
ventilation system and comparing this to a conventional variable air volume
with reheat overhead system.

I cannot seem to set an exact total AHU airflow rate that has been
calculated by the mechanical design engineer. When I do this, the eQuest
program adds about 15% of airflow to the AHU airflow rate I specified. I
specified at the zone and at the system level and each time, it increases
the total airflow rate, even when I remove the exhaust airflow. Has anyone
had this happen to them before? I did set the altitude to zero since that is
what you are supposed to do if you want to put in exact airflow rates.

The number of hours outside the throttling range for the displacement system
is very high since the temperature entering the space is a constant 68 F and
the setpoint for the room is 70 F. The baseboard sizes have been entered and
are maximized for the exterior wall. If I change the plenum height to
anything above six feet being plenum, then part of my windows will be in the
plenum which eQuest has a problem with. I have put in all the possible
mechanical design parameters of the two types of systems into eQuest, except
the fact that one is entering in overhead and one system is entering into
the space at the floor level. I'm not sure if it is reasonable to assume
that it is modeled correctly with many unmet hours of heating. But perhaps
it is due to the limitations of modeling this type of system? Has anyone
effectively estimated the performance of displacement ventilation in eQuest
such that it is as designed without many unmet heating hours?

Also, just for some background, there is no cooling - cooling is provided
only by an economizer cycle as they have summers off and the school is in
the mountains.

Any suggestions to either of these issues would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you,

Ren?e

I have been saying no to the CAD file connection - and it seems to work. except you have to do this step everytime you open the file. The pd2 seems to be a better idea although I can't find it in the folder.

I made my eQUEST model using CAD backgrounds and saved it on my computer.

 

I copied the folders (model and backgrounds) to the network drive. I can get the model to come up, but it prompts me to browse for the cad file. I found it's new location for each background, and the model ran fine.

 

However, when I come back into it, eQUEST once again asked for the location of the CAD background files. 

 

 

What can I do to get it to recognize where the backgrounds are located every time I start the program up?

 

 

Also, how do I purge/erase the result file listings for all the projects I've worked on in the left column every time I view a new simulation's results?

You can modify the path of CAD file that is referenced by your eQuest 
file in the pd2 file. Open it in text editor, and you will find the path 
is defined at the bottom of the file.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200602170925.AA2555843pd80000990243@gard.com>

So is there anyway to detach it once I've completed my model using
detailed edit mode?

 

If I switch back to wizard, then all of that work in the detailed edit
mode will be lost...and I don't want that!

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Re-pathing a CAD background

 

I made my eQUEST model using CAD backgrounds and saved it on my
computer.

 

I copied the folders (model and backgrounds) to the network drive. I can
get the model to come up, but it prompts me to browse for the cad file.
I found it's new location for each background, and the model ran fine.

 

However, when I come back into it, eQUEST once again asked for the
location of the CAD background files. 

 

 

What can I do to get it to recognize where the backgrounds are located
every time I start the program up?

 

 

Also, how do I purge/erase the result file listings for all the projects
I've worked on in the left column every time I view a new simulation's
results? 

 

Thanks.

Item 2 is easier - the results list all projects in the \Projects\
sub-directory.  If you don't want the results listed, move the project
directories from the eQUEST Projects\ subdirectory to somewhere else.
(I have a project_archives\ directory so I don't keep displaying all
my client's results.)

 

I believe the CAD background is in the .pd2 file.  Once I have the
building geometry, I tend to sever the connection to the .dwg file
believing it frees up some resources and decreases file size.  (I
don't know about the accuracy of this belief.)

Yes.
Under the Design Development wizard, from the "Project Navigator"
screen, you can create new building shells after you have setup and laid
out a single story shell .
When creating a new shell you have the option to copy one you have
already made.
This copy can then be located above the original building shell and
modified with a different zoning pattern.
Please feel free to contact me if you require more clarification.
This can all be done from detailed edit mode but it is more time
consuming.

couldn't specify separate zones for different levels. Is it possible to
do it? If so, I would appreciate all the help I can get.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200602151724.AA2445703pd80000987817@gard.com>

We are modeling a building which has a large shops
zone that requires 100% exhaust and the make up air
comes from adjacent zones via a transfer duct. The
exhaust air from the shops runs through a heat pipe
and provides energy recovery to a portion of the main
building air handler fresh air intake as a dedicated
heat recovery system. We do not want to run heat
recovery on all the building fresh air, just the
amount equal to the shops exhaust. Since Equest
defines the air flow rate through the energy recovery
unit as the sum of all fresh air demands, we cannot
measure the savings from the exhaust air alone. Any
modeling tips?

Subject: [bldg-sim] 2 Circulation Loops with TES
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200602151709.AA0907921pd80000987807@gard.com>

I am trying to simulate a TES system that is charged by one dedicated
chiller (and attached chilled water circulation loop) and discharges to
the main chilled water loop, which is attached to the cooling coils.

When the simulation proceeds past load calcs, I get the following error:

Loop: Circulation Loop 5 has zero design flow. Check input for
consistency, or specify design loads.

Circulation loop 5 refers to my dedicated chilled water loop that is
served by a small chiller and charges my TES system.  The TES system is
the load on this loop, so that load should cause a design flow.  

Has anyone encountered a similar problem?

Thank you!

On the first question, one of the chiller types in eQUEST is "water
economizer" - which is effectively a heat exchanger between the
chilled and condenser water loops.  You will have to play with your
loop equipment controls and load management to set when the chillers
are cooling and when you are on "free cooling".

I was simulating the central plant for a hotel in eQuest. I have a
couple of questions on modeling the condenser water control.

 

1.       I was trying to model free-cooling plate-to-frame heat

this. Any suggestions?

2.       When I tried to add VFD on my condenser water pumps, I get a

the pumps (though I used them for the chillers being modeled - but I

Please excuse the cross-postings...

This is a reminder that February 19 is the deadline for submitting 
abstracts for the 7th International conference on System Simulation in 
Buildings (SSB 2006). The conference will be held in Li?ge (Belgium) on 
December 11-13, 2006.

As the previous ones, this 7th conference is organized in very close 
cooperation with the International Energy Agency group "Energy 
Conservation in Building and Community Systems" (IEA-ECBCS) and with the 
American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning 
Engineers (ASHRAE). This conference will be, among others, the occasion 
to present some last results coming from the IEA-ECBCS Annex 40 
"Commissioning of Building HVAC Systems for Improved Building 
Performance" and to deal with some aspects of the new Annexes 43 
"Testing and Validation of Building Energy Simulation Tools", 47 "Cost 
Effective Commissioning of Existing and Low-Energy Buildings" and 48 
"Heat Pumping and Reversible Air Conditioning".

The following topics will be considered in priority:
  * modeling of HVAC components
  * system simulation methods and tools
  * application to commissioning
  * application to energy management and to maintenance
  * application to audit and retrofit

Abstracts must be submitted via email to the SSB secretariat 
(vincent.lemort at ulg.ac.be).

More information on the conference can be found at:

  Does anyone know of any research or published papers on ventilated facades for extreme climates (~100?F for several months in the summer and around freezing for several winter months).  I am interested in the application of a ventilated facade in Sacramento California.  To add on that, does anyone know of a ventilated facade building currently constructed in Sacramento.

  Ian,

   



  You raised a very good point. Here are some of the things that I would like to share and I would appreciate some input myself:

   

  1.    You wrote:

   

  [I'm concerned about insect screens affecting the buoyancy driven airflow for a double skin fa?ade.]

   

  Dr. Karl Gertis (director of the Fraunhofer Institute of Building Physics in Stuttgart, Germany) provides a critical review of double-skin fa?ades in one of his article and cites some problems in the literature regarding research related to Glass Double Facade e.g. "window insect screens cannot be used with natural ventilation because the airflow is too weak to overcome the pressure loss over the air filter."

   

  For more information about the article please go to the following link:

  2.    You wrote:

   

  [I was wondering if anyone new of some papers that have covered the airflow properties of insect screens or can give me some information off hand.]

   

   

              Jun Tanimoto, Jun and Kimura, Ken-ichi (1997), Simulation study on an air flow window system with an integrated roll screen, Energy and Buildings             26(3): 317-325.

   



  There are a few sources that also deal with the effect of insect screen on airflow but they are specific to wind driven natural ventilation. 

   

              Swami, M.V. and Chandra, S. (1988), Correlations for pressure distribution on buildings and calculation of natural ventilation airflow, ASHRAE Transactions, Vol. 94, Part 1, pp 243-266.

   

  This paper provides a procedure for determining ventilation rates based on the Vickery algorithm (1983), however, assumption inherent in this procedure is that there is no stack effect.

    

              Givoni, B. (1981), Man, Climate and Architecture, New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold.

              

  On pp 304 Section 15.8 Givoni discusses the effect of fly-screens on ventilation. He quotes van Straaten, the decrease in total airflow, caused by a 16 mesh, 30 gauge wire screen is about 60% and 50% when the wind speeds are respectively 1.5 and 2 mph and only about 25% when the wind speed is 10 mph.

   

  Straateen, J. F. van, (1967), Thermal performance of buildings, Elsevier Publishing Co Ltd

   

   

  3.    You wrote:



  [I'm also wondering how to incorporate their effects on the flow by use of discharge coefficients and pressure loss coefficients.]

   

  Andersen, Karl T. (1995), Theoretical considerations on natural ventilation by thermal buoyancy, ASHRAE Trans. 1995, Vol.101, Part 2, Paper number SD-95-14-1, 1103-1117

   

  For abstract please visit the following link:

  http://resourcecenter.ashrae.org/store/ashrae/newstore.cgi?itemid=17248&view=item&categoryid=452&categoryparent=452&page=1&loginid=1357156

   

  In the section 'coefficients of interest' the author discusses velocity, contraction, discharge, and resistance coefficients and may provide insight into the effect of insect screen on airflow, however, the author does not directly relate it to the insect screen.



  There is a gap in the computation of natural ventilation research especially in terms of discharge coefficients and pressure loss coefficients as Ansyley (1999) and Linden (1999) point out that the computation of natural ventilation lacks experimental data and borrows the discharge coefficient and flow resistance of openings derived from data traditionally used for fluid flow in pipes and resistance values traditionally used in computation of mine ventilation.

Dear Vikram,
 
I believe that Andrew Marsh is still working on the new version of
Ecotect (ver. 5.5). You can reach him via email under his Cardiff
account. Square One kindly provided some temporary beta licenses for a
daylighting workshop at MIT two weeks ago in which we used the new
export function from Ecotect into Daysim. I found the daylight
simulation capabilities of the new version (new Radiance control panel
etc.) significantly improved over 5.2. I am not sure when it will be
officially released but it is worth the wait.

Autodesk does not support vertical adjacencies.  In other words, there
is no way to define the adjacency of an espace ceiling to another espace
floor.  We have told Autodesk about this problem GBS.
 
On the other hand, GBS requires adjacencies to be defined for the model
to run.  For many models the results would be sufficiently accurate if
internal partitions were treated as adiabatic.  If GBS had a switch to
ignore vertical adjacencies and insert adiabatic partition instead, ABS
and GBS would work together.  
 
In conclusion, ABS epaces and GBS do not work together for multi story
buildings because of the vertical adjacency problem.  Single floor
buildings should work although you have to be careful with the internal
load definitions because all the ABS values get pulled into the GBS
model.

Hi there, I have a question regarding to converting GBXML from ABS to
GBS. GBS keep giving me error messages such as "Surface id= su13_Floor,
an InteriorFloor, should have two spaces adjacent to it. It has 1
defined." As such, I constructed a test run with only 1 espace on first
level and 1 espace on second level. The second level espace is perfectly
line up above the first level espace. The error message remains with the
second level spaces' floor type set to "Interior Space." The error
message only goes away when the floor type is changed to "Raised Floor."
However, I thought "raised floor" is referring to under floor
distribution. Does Autodesk has different terminology? Is it the right
setting for slab to slab construction?  If not, what other possibility
for the error?

 

Also, from my other test run, I found out that if the space has partial
roof, it needs to be separated by two espaces.

 

Many thanks!!!!!

Does anyone know of any research or published papers on ventilated facades for extreme climates (~100?F for several months in the summer and around freezing for several winter months).  I am interested in the application of a ventilated facade in Sacramento California.  To add on that, does anyone know of a ventilated facade building currently constructed in Sacramento.

Gerald,

In my experience with PowerDOE, we've simulated wetbulb reset using a reset
control on the condenser loop setpoint, but my memory is that you can only
have a reset schedule based on drybulb.  We developed drybulb reset
schedules that approximated the desired wetbulb function, and then checked
the reasonableness of the schedules by developing hourly reports for
wetbulb, setpoint, and actual loop temp.

One recollection was that in PowerDOE, the descriptions of the input
variables in the reset schedule were very counterintuitive, so the hourly
report was a good way to debug this as well.  

Hopefully this is applicable to your situation in eQuest.

Hi All,
This is regarding Wet bulb reset controls for cooling

control for cooling towers. However in EQUEST, does
load reset in a condensor water loop similar in
operation to a WB reset?
Your inputs are appreciated.

This is probably due to the conductivity of aluminum slats in venetian
blinds.  The conductance of the thin aluminum slat is very high and it
probably exceeds limiting value for DOE2 import.  I have forwarded this
issue to the rest of the W6 development team, but it could be that this
check would need to be skipped for imports from W6.

Hello,
I was testing the new Windows 6 research version which has the ability to
create glazing assemblies with interstitial blinds. However, I am unable to
import the DOE 2 window definition into eQUEST. It's some sort of pane
conductance error.

Pane Conductance #2 (106666) not in valid range (0 -
10000)

It looks like it exceeds the pane conductance range as defined by DOE2.
Any thoughts on this?

Hello,
I was testing the new Windows 6 research version which
has the ability to create glazing assemblies with
interstitial blinds. However, I am unable to import
the DOE 2 window definition into eQUEST. It?s some
sort of pane conductance error.

Pane Conductance #2 (106666) not in valid range (0 -
10000)

It looks like it exceeds the pane conductance range as
defined by DOE2.
Any thoughts on this?

Gerald

This is telling you that your entering chilled water temperature must be at
least 6 degrees below your coil leaving temperature.  Since your cooling
supply temp is 52 degrees, your chilled water temperature would have to be
46 degrees or less.  If it is less than that, check for CHW temperature
reset.  You could also have some heat gain in the SA duct, requiring an even
lower coil leaving temperature and CHW temperature.

Incidentally, I believe this was added with DOE-2.2.  Prior to that DOE-2.1E
and most other simulation programs didn't care if your coil expectations
were possible or not.  They just did a BTU transfer, so you could have a
supply air temperature lower than your entering CHW temperature.

The problem you are experiencing has to do with a bug in your 
video/graphics drivers. This driver bug causes eQUEST to bomb while 
trying to assemble and/or display a 3-D view of the building model 
(which utilizes OpenGL).
If you visit the ATI website and search their database for updated 
drivers compatible with both your video card and operating system, you 
should find more recent (fixed) versions than the one you are currently 
using are available for download.

Hi All,
This is regarding Wet bulb reset controls for cooling
towers. I think DOE 2.1 has specific keyword for WB
control for cooling towers. However in EQUEST, does
load reset in a condensor water loop similar in
operation to a WB reset?
Your inputs are appreciated.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200602030911.AA1138546pd80000970964@gard.com>

This is a great discussion. There are a lot of control strategies to
mitigate the increased cooling and fan energy impact of energy and heat
recovery units in eQuest. 

However, small (residential) ERVs and HRVs don't have these control
strategies available generally.  The only control option that seems to be
common, is to allow the energy recovery wheel to be turned off for an
economizer temperature range.  ERV/HRV fans still have to run, as there is
no bypass.  Are there small units that do have a full range of control
options?

The eQuest simulation suggests that the units without sophisticated
controlsmay cause a net increase in fan energy, and cooling energy that
offsets or more than offsets the heating energy savings, at least in our
mild Portland climate.  

Do others see similar simulation results for simple ERVs and HRVs, and does
that mean that these type of units may not save much if any energy?  Is that
not true for more extreme weather locations?

Extending on what Brian has said, a few years back I had a good look at the
hourly output to understand what the heat recovery controls were doing.  I
was using dry bulb controls and ran simulations with a number of
diiferential dry bulb cut-out temperatures.  I found that 6-8DegF was about
optimal for the climate / building I was studying.  The moral of the story
was be careful with dry bulb controls as they will often bring in moisture
and increase loads if you are using a small differential DT.  Conversely
setting a low differential enthalpy control will increase sensible cooling
and on coil temperatures under some conditions ...

Periodically there is a thread on this forum about EQuest's ERVs and heat
recovery and non intuitive results.  My experience has been that if you
understand what the various configuration / control inputs mean then you
will get reasonable hourly and thus annual energy results ...

Graham

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200602030830.AA303115pd80000970789@gard.com>

Hello all,

 

Does anyone have any experience in simulating the effects of fume cupboards
in laboratory facilities?

 

The building has several fume cupboards which extract air from the zone at
0.25m3/s with the cupboard door open and 0.1 with the cupboard door closed.
The areas are naturally ventilated however there are wall mounted motorised
dampers which replenish the lost air (when the fume cupboard is turned on).
The final bit of information is that a fume cupboard's fans are located on
the roof. These fans force the fumes away from the building at a rate of
10m/s.

 

Does anyone have any suggestions?

 

Kind regards

The equest user manual is a good resource for understanding the use of

to apply them is included in Vol2-Dictionary.  In the Table of Contents
look for "HVAC Components" ---> "System" --> "Ventilation Air".  Scroll

Extending on what Brian has said, a few years back I had a good look at the
hourly output to understand what the heat recovery controls were doing.  I
was using dry bulb controls and ran simulations with a number of
diiferential dry bulb cut-out temperatures.  I found that 6-8DegF was about
optimal for the climate / building I was studying.  The moral of the story
was be careful with dry bulb controls as they will often bring in moisture
and increase loads if you are using a small differential DT.  Conversely
setting a low differential enthalpy control will increase sensible cooling
and on coil temperatures under some conditions ...

Periodically there is a thread on this forum about EQuest's ERVs and heat

The reason why your cooling load goes up because if
the ERV control is set where the fans run throughout
the HVAC operations, the ERV recoveres heat in summer
where the cooling coils need to then recool. One way
to mitigate this is to add a bypass damper for the OA
coltrol so that when the building is economizing, it
bypasses the ERV. Set minimum OA and mixed air reset,
and choose OA bypass. Also in heat recovery 2, you can
set the supply fan to "self contained" instead of the
fan energy being picked up by the HVAC main equipment.

Hope this helps.

Note that the default "Make-up air temperature control" for energy
recovery ventilators in eQUEST is to "Float" the supply air
temperature -- meaning they will continue to recover heat regardless
of discharge air temperature, increasing the cooling load unless the
default is changed.   Changing it to "Mixed Air Reset" has a
considerable effect -- eliminating most of the excess cooling.  

I guess it depends on your economizer operation -- whether it is on a
fixed drybulb or on differential drybulb or enthalpy.

One thing I wondered about this was the amount of cooling increase
showing
with eQuest modeling of an ERV.  I have not done a real study, but
tried
modeling one case without any added fan energy, and running it with
the
economizer active with the ERV run control set to WHEN-MIN-OA, which
turns
off the heat recovery when the economizer is active (stops the wheel
for a
wheel type).  Even with these two strategies, which should eliminate
the
bulk of increased cooling, there is still significant increased
cooling.  

Have others tried this, and are there other explanations for the
cooling
results?
