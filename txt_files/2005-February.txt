Bill,
   There has been a good bit of work done in Europe with double facade 
buildings using TRNSYS coupled with COMIS. An email to the TRNSYS group 
list might turn up some more specific information on projects and 
experiences. You can sign up for the list by going to 
http://sel.me.wisc.edu/trnsys by following the "EMail List" link.
Kind regards,
   David

Has anyone modelled energy savings due to double wall construction? If
so, what software did you use? DOE2 has a sunspace module that could be
modified to mimic a double wall cavity, but this is not meant for
multistory applications. I am looking at a multistory office building

Hi  Dan,
 
You can use a reflectance of 0.70 or greater i.e. absorptance of 0.3 or less
for the roof. Also the effect of the U-value of the roof construction will
change so you will have to set a multiplier for the u-vlaue of the roof.
This can be referenced in the ASHRAE 90.1 - 1999 Users manual in the
Building Envelope section - page 5-20 table 5-E which gives the Roof
U-factor multipliers for the various climate zones.
 
Regards,

Hi, everyone:
 
To test the impact of extrior shading on building energy performance, I want to make a control strategy for the exterior shading device.  Could somebody tell me in general reference for controlling the solar radition on windows?  Fox example, when the solar radition exceeds how much watt per square meter on the window area, then the shading devices can be activated and start to work.
 
Any comments is highly appreciated.
 
Thanks.

PV

I am looking for information on high-rise buildings that utilize power
from PV panels on vertical exterior wall surfaces.  What are the typical
applications for power from PV panels in existing buildings?  Where can
I find technical literature on how this power is converted, stored and
utilized?  What would be an estimate of the usable power per month per
unit area of PV panel for the East, South & West vertical surfaces for
say 42 degrees North latitude? Are there any studies of maintenance
costs and payback?  Are there examples of how to show energy savings
from PV panels for code compliance and LEED certification using energy
analysis programs?

 

Double Wall

Are there examples of how to show energy savings from double-wall
buildings for code compliance and LEED certification using energy
analysis programs?  The model I am looking at consists of single glass
on the outside and double glass on the inside.  The objective is to trap
the radiant heat in the cavity in winter and ventilate the cavity in
summer.  Ventilation would be from stack effect due to openings at the
top and bottom or forced ventilation.  Does the depth of the cavity
space make a difference?  Is there a significant difference in stack
effect if the cavity height is one floor or two or more floors?  What
are the recommended properties of the two glass walls to trap the heat
in the cavity in winter and maximize the transmission of light at all
times?

 

Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs)

Are there examples of how to show energy savings for code compliance and
LEED certification using energy analysis programs from (1) under floor
air distribution, (2) displacement ventilation, and (3) occupancy based
lighting & ventilation controls?

 

Energy Programs

Has there been a survey of which energy programs are being used by A-E
design firms to show energy savings for code compliance and LEED
certification?

It usually includes task lighting only on the assumption that it would be 
used on the task lighting schedule in sync with general 
lighting.  Projectors are used intermittently and can usually be 
ignored.  Even if they are used very often and considered, they probably 
fit better into the equipment loads.

The intent of the lighting load is to simulate energy usage and heat gain 
from the lights.  The computer monitors do not really fit that category 
(unless the computer monitor is being treated as a source of light instead 
of say an overhead lamp, which does not seem very likely).  Computer 
monitors again would be more appropriately accounted for in equipment.

If the task lighting is already designed, then that actual wattage is the 
design case lighting.  In that case, if the design lighting is higher than 
0.35 W/ft2, the code lighting is 0.35 W/ft2; if the design lighting is less 
than 0.35 W/ft2, then the code case lighting is coded same as the design 
lighting. In other words, you do not get credit for reducing task lighting 
below 0.35 W/ft2, but you do get penalized for going over.

If the task lighting is not designed yet, both design case and code case 
can assume 0.35 W/ft2 if it is definite that there will be some, as yet 
undetermined, task lighting in that area.
If there is going to be no task lighting in that area, both the design case 
and the code case should not have the task lighting load included.

For the occupied periods only, the lighting schedule can be reduced by a 
fraction.  It is as exceptional method under code.

ASHRAE Std User's manual defines the perimeter zone as 15 feet deep.  The 
sensor should be located well inside this zone, that is 10' inside, or at 
the very least, halfway inside at 7.5' to get a fair idea of energy savings 
from daylight for the entire zone.
LEED does give credit for 'daylight glazing' from high windows.. the 
calculation is clearly shown in the LEED manual.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200502181512.AA1255921pd80000567629@gard.com>

Who should I contact at IECC for interpretation of the code?  In the
meantime I have some questions (pardon my ignorance) regarding lighting.

 

IECC-2000, page 114, table 805.4.2 (also in the Chicago Building Code)
shows the following lighting power densities for office building:

 

Entire Building:                                      1.3 W/ft2

Tenant Area or Portion of Building:       1.5 W/ft2

 

There is a Note "b" associated with office (and also classrooms/lecture
halls) which states: 

 

"Where lighting equipment is specified to be installed to meet
requirements of visual display terminals as the primary viewing task,
the smaller of the actual wattage of the lighting equipment or 0.35
W/ft2 times area of space that the lighting equipment is in shall be
added to the interior lighting power determined in accordance with this
item"

 

I assume that the entire building area is the gross area which includes
the core (elevator & duct shaft plan sections) and underground parking.
The net area is about 15% less than the gross area and this would be the
tenant area.  1.3 W/ft2 * 1.15 = 1.5 W/ft2

 

Is the "lighting equipment" task lighting only, or does it include other
equipment such as projectors?

Are computer monitors (visual display terminals) a "lighting equipment"
since it also generates light?

 

What is "the smaller of the actual wattage of the lighting equipment or
0.35 W/ft2 times area of space that the lighting equipment is in shall
be added to the interior lighting power"?  Given a tenant space of 100
ft2 that has 1.0 W/ft2 general lighting and a 100 watt task light, what
is the area lighting of the space for code compliance?

 

Is there a lighting program or Excel spreadsheet program that will
calculate the W/ft2 at the ceiling given the illuminance required at the
task level, the type of lighting fixture or luminaire, and the ceiling
height?  I think manufacturers should provide this calculator for their
luminaires.

 

How would you show energy savings for occupancy based lighting controls?
In 10CFR435 Table 514.1 "Power Adjustment Factor (PAF)", the PAF for
Occupancy Sensor is 0.3.  When using energy analysis programs, can we
reduce the lighting schedule fractions by 30% for the proposed design
compared to the prototype or base design?

 

Increasing the percent glass of the envelope and increasing the ceiling
height also reduces lighting usage because of increased daylighting.
Daylight can now reach deeper into the interior.  How would you show
this energy savings using computer programs?  Can the perimeter zone
depth be increased to say 30 feet?  The DOE2.1E program lets you locate
two light sensors in the perimeter zones but the codes do not specify
where in the zone. They could both be located 5 feet from the window as
representing the entire perimeter zone depth.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200502160222.AA2220890pd80000563485@gard.com>

I am humbly asking for help from anyone who is DOE or Equest guru.
 
I was going to create a separate hourly report in Equest. As instructed in DOE2.1 e Supplment, my practice was to put HOURLY-DATA-SAVE=FORMATTED in LOADS-REPORT COMMAND in the input file. Then the input file was complied by Equest 3.53. But the *.FILE, which is supposed to be the hourly report file, was not created.
 
My questions:
1). Does Equest support the hourly report separately created as what was done in DOE 2.1/2.2?
2). Was my practice correct or not?
3) If no to above 2 questions, how can create a seperate hourly report with good enough format for post-processing?
 
Yours inputs are highly appreciated.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200502090927.AA2756296pd80000553835@gard.com>

Dear bldg-sim users,

 

I am modeling a building with south-facing roof monitors combined with
interior baffles spaced to shield all direct sunlight using DOE 2.1E. I had
an excessive fan sizing without modeling interior baffles. I think I should
include them in the modeling, but my questions are

 

(1)    Should an individual interior baffle be modeled? or

(2)    Can I use a shading coefficient value to account for the reduction in
the entry of solar radiation due to interior baffles? If so, what value
would be appropriate?

 

Any comment will be greatly appreciated.

 

Regards,

Younju

Dear colleagues, 

 

My apologies for any cross postings. 

 

The National Research Council Canada and the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar
Energy Systems have released version 2.1 of the Daysim daylighting analysis
tool. Daysim is based on LBNL's Radiance software and combines the Perez sky
model with a daylight coefficient approach to effectively predict the annual
daylight availability (daylight factor and daylight autonomy) in buildings
for multiple sites worldwide (you can import EnergyPlus epw climate files).
Daysim further features a user behavior model which allows to compare the
electric lighting use for manual and automated controls (occupancy sensor,
photocell control). The software runs under Windows and Linux OS and can be
downloaded from  <http://www.daysim.com/> www.daysim.com. The following new
features have been added since version 2.0:

*	extended tutorial: an extensive document to help newcomers to get
started with daylight simulations 

*	step-by-step instructions of how to import building scenes from
AutoCAD, SketchUp, and Ecotect into Daysim 

*	a list of case studies of how your colleagues have used Daysim in
actual building projects 

*	improved simulation output in html-format 

*	improved JAVA GUI with an extensive help file system 

*	based on Radiance version 3R6P1(latest version) 

*	the new version allows to model Radiance function file materials
(transdata, etc.)

Your comments/suggestions are appreciated. Best regards,

 

Christoph

Is the total cooling load less than 150 tons?  If so there is a LEED CIR 
which allows the use of System 3 in comparison to a GSHP.  This will garner 
you more "savings/points".

If greater than 150 tons you use System 6 with a cooling tower and WSHPs.

You cannot take credit for lowering cooling energy due to a non-regulated 
component such as appliances under EAc1.  The energy use for these items 
must be identical in the proposed and budget models.  Savings in this area 
could be eligible for an innovation point, see the numerous CIRs on this 
subject for more guidance.

Subject: [bldg-sim] LEEDS and GHP's
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200502081435.AA352631pd80000552592@gard.com>

I humbly request the advice of any/all energy experts that are familiar 
with LEED and ASHRAE 90.1

We've been asked to perform the energy modeling for a LEED project and 
could use the experience of the masses to help us past a stumbling block 
that we've run into.  A little background.  The project is a 4-story major 
remodeling project that has converted an old office building to new 
condominiums.  The building is equipped with multiple geothermal heat pumps 
(1 or 2 per condo) and utilizes a vertical bore ground heat exchanger 
system for the source/sink for the heat pumps.  After modeling the as-built 
system in detail using TRNSYS, it is time for us to fill out the energy 
cost budget report and get the base-building system modeled.  Reviewing 
ASHRAE 90.1-99 we are directed to Table 11.4.3 (the HVAC Systems Map) that 
shows the budget system type as System 6; Water-Source Heat Pumps.  The 
heating system type for this system is listed as "electric heat pumps and 
boiler".  So far so good, no problems here understanding the 
intent.  However the cooling type is listed as "direct expansion" with a 
note that states the fuel type for the budget building system must match 
the fuel type for the proposed design.  Fair enough, we have geothermal 
heat pumps providing the cooling so the fuel type for the budget cooling 
system should then be electricity.  But here we run into the stumbling 
block.  Typically water-source heat pumps would employ a cooling tower for 
the heat rejection; is that what is meant/intended - ok forget 
meant/intended, let's go with "required" - by the standard?  Typically 
"direct expansion" refers to a chiller; most likely an air-cooled chiller 
for this application, or sometimes even a PTAC.  However, a base case 
system that utilizes water source heat pumps and a boiler for heating, and 
a chiller with fan coils (or a PTAC)  for cooling just doesn't make any 
sense....

If the guideline is intentionally vague and I have complete flexibility in 
choosing an electric cooling option for the budget building (within the 
minimum performance guidelines) does anyone have any recommendations for 
the "worst" system type for the budget building that will maximize the EA 
credits and still meet the 90.1 requirements?  We're right on the 
borderline of LEED Silver and a few percentage points in energy savings can 
make a big difference in the number of points received.

One last question as long as I still have your attention.  Its our 
understanding that the building plug loads (non-lighting) are a 
non-regulated item for LEED and we cannot take direct credit for installing 
high-efficiency appliances.  However, can the indirect credit of lower 
cooling energy consumption as a result of lower cooling loads from reduced 
internal gains be used for the proposed building?  Are we in a gray area 
here?  And if so, how gray - charcoal?

Thanks in advance for any help that you are able to provide; its been a 
frustrating couple of days trying to decipher the documents.

Jeff

Besides using Meteonorm, does anyone have any suggestions for how to obtain
hourly weather data for a remote location in northeastern Tibet?

The site in question is near the city of Yushu in Qinghai Province, China
(33N, 97E, 3800 m elevation).

Any ideas would be much appreciated.

Many thanks,

A few years ago, I attempted to use Meteonorm to create/adjust weather 
files for a high desert location in Arizona. That generation of 
Meteonorm always created files with much smaller diurnal temperature 
swings than the reference desert city. The humidities may not have been 
in an appropriate range either. We could not find any way to drive 
Meteonorm to produce reasonable outputs, and did not get any suggestions 
back from the developers. Perhaps Meteonorm is too Euro-centric to deal 
with our desert, or perhaps this problem was fixed in the version used 
to create the E+ files.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Question about chiller efficiency
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200502041139.AA3930609pd80000546963@gard.com>

Dear  everyone:
Now we are working on a simulation whith equest 3.53,in which we defined a customer part load chiller efficiency curve by input the cop at different load condition.	When applied the customer defined chiller efficiency curve, we find that the result chiller energy is a negetive value and make the total energy comsuption a smaller one. But when the curve is applied to other building, everything seems to be ok anf the result is  somewhat reasonable one.

I would like to know if there are someone else met this problem before and what can be done to make it work.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

CTG Energetics recently prepared an example LEED-NC v2.1 EAc1 submittal
for the USGBC in November 2004. In this documentation the example
project adopted a 20% LPD credit for occupant sensor controls in private
offices, which is based on a CIR submitted 12/2/2003 and ruled upon
2/4/2004 (There are studies supporting a wide range of savings (20% to
43%) in private office.  Savings in open office environment would be
significantly less.)

So, it seems that 20% LPD adjustment for private office is acceptable by
USGBC.  Hope this helps.

Hi Bill-
I do not have direct experince obtaining LEED credit for Occupancy
Sensors, but I too am currently looking into this issue for a LEED
project.

As you note, It's my understanding that USGBC has not yet formally
adopted either 90.1-2001, or addendum e to 90.1-2001. (Rumor has it that
they will update directly to 90.1-2004 when they do update.)

I interpret the table G3.8 in addendum e to 90.1-2001 to show the
suggested adjustments to proposed L.P.D levels. I agree that the
language of:
'automatic lighting controls in *addition* to those required  for
minimum code compliance.' is very confusing. However, I think that
adjustments are suggested according to the table listings based on use
type either " Non 24-hour use and Less than or equal to 5,000 sq.ft." OR
"All Other Spaces".
My reading is that even though automatic shutoff controls are listed as
a mandatory measure for "All other" spaces in 90.1 1999 section 9.2,
that the listed L.P.D. adjustments for installation of either
programmable timing control, Occupancy Sensor, or Both are allowed.
(Note that the listed adjustment under "All Other", " Programmable
timing control" is zero
adjustment.)

Still , keep in mind that addendum e is not offically adopted by USGBC
yet.

For now, I'm working from 90.1-1999 and the published USGBC CIRs. There
is a Credit Interpretation Request that you have access to on the USGBC
web site if your organization is a USGBC member. I've copied the text
below in case some list members do not have access to the CIRs.(see
below.) The ruling on Measure 1 is the pertinent one, which states
adjustment of L.P.D. may be an acceptable means of approximating
Occupancy sensors without modifying the schedules between proposed and
baseline.

I have anecdotally heard that other projects used an adjustment of 20%
in the proposed L.P.D. for an office use and received credit. I'm
planning on trying this adjustment for the model I'm working on (since
it's 5% more than the addendum e listing).

Best wishes,
Molly Curtz

      12/2/2003 -  Credit Interpretation Request
      Four energy-efficiency measures, which are not covered under
ASHRAE
90.1-1999 or the LEED Energy Modeling Protocol, are outlined below for a
106,000 square foot chemistry research laboratory building with numerous
lab fume hoods. These four measures generate significant energy cost
savings.

      Based on the following USGBC Credit Rulings posted on 06/07/2001,
06/27/2001 and 01/20/2002:
      "To document savings for [energy reducing strategies not covered
under ASHRAE 90.1-1999 or the LEED Energy Modeling Protocol], follow the
ECB Exceptional Calculation Method. See Section 11.5 of the ASHRAE 90.1
User''s Manual. Under the ECM, schedule variations may be used as a
basis of engineering calculations for discrete measures that are
precluded by the reference standard or the LEED EMP."

      We assume each energy-efficiency measure listed below should be
modeled discreetly and "exceptional" savings must be subtracted from the
Design Energy Cost in the same fashion as renewable energy.

      Based on the USGBC''s LEED Credit Ruling posted on 11/09/2001:
      "It is acceptable to use [the same simulation tool that is used
for the base simulation] to triangulate on projected savings for
discrete measures that can ONLY be approximated through schedule
manipulations."

      We assume that these Exceptional Calculation Methods (ECM''s) are
to be performed using the same simulation tool that is used for the base
simulation.

      For the first three energy-efficiency measures listed below, a
corresponding reduction in energy use can only be approximated by
altering the Base Building schedules (based on sound engineering
judgement).
Therefore, we hereby request preliminary approval for the first three
energy saving measures listed. Hourly schedules for lighting power
density and fumehood exhaust in both the Design Building and Base
Building are available for each case for review.

      1. Lighting Occupancy Sensors
      When motion and/or infrared sensors determine a space to be
unoccupied for a period of at least 15 minutes (adjustable), lighting
within the space is automatically reduced to minimum levels.

      2. Fumehood Zone Presence Sensors
      When locally mounted infrared sensors determine the zone in front
of a particular fumehood to be unoccupied for a period of at least 15
minutes (adjustable), laboratory exhaust quantities shall be adjusted to
reduce sash velocity from 100 fpm to 70 fpm for that individual
fumehood.

      3. Fumehood Occupancy Sensors
      Similar to Lighting Occupancy Sensors, when motion and/or infrared
sensors determine a space to be unoccupied for a period of at least 15
minutes (adjustable), laboratory exhaust quantities shall be adjusted to
reduce the minimum total room air change rate from 12 ACH to 6 ACH.
      Additionally, we request preliminary approval for the following
energy saving measure, to be modeled as noted below:

      4. Laboratory Air Cascading
      A portion of the makeup air required for fumehood exhaust shall be
delivered to offices and support areas and then "cascaded" to labs via a
ducted transfer air system. Ducts shall be sized so that the external
pressure drop realized along the path of the transfer air shall be a
maximum of 0.05" w.g.

      The Exceptional Calculation Method proposed would compare two
analogous air-handling system (one for office/support areas and one for
the laboratories), by breaking the air-handling system into two discreet
pieces, to facilitate comparison of the Base and Design building models.

      2/4/2004 -  Ruling
      ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURE 1:
      It appears that altering the schedule to approximate energy
savings from the lighting occupancy sensors (as described) fits within
the context of the 90.1 Exceptional Calculation Method. When calculating
the energy savings associated with these measures for EAc1, it is
necessary to justify both the proposed and budget schedules for occupied
hours and provide detailed space by space usage schedules that are both
reasonable and defensible. The budget and proposed building should have
the same lighting schedules for regularly unoccupied periods.
Additionally, it may be possible to arrive at a reasonable estimate by
manipulating the lighting power density in the proposed and design case.

      ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES 2 AND 3:
      Fumehoods are considered process loads, which are not applicable
to EA Prerequisite 2 and EA Credit 1. The appropriate treatment of
laboratory process loads is the subject of numerous LEED CIRs. Please
refer to the EAp2 credit ruling dated 12/15/03 and EAc1.1 credit ruling
dated 12/15/03 for a discussion of the appropriate treatment of ASHRAE
90.1 non-regulated energy loads in EAc1. To maintain consistency with
the referenced standard, optimization of non-regulated energy loads is
recognized by award of an Innovation in Design (ID) credit rather than
award of EAc1 points.
      For ID credit calculations, it appears that altering the schedule
to approximate energy savings from the fumehood zone presence sensors
and the fumehood occupancy sensors (as described) fits within the
context of the
90.1 Exceptional Calculation Method. When calculating the energy savings
associated with these measures for ID credit award, it is necessary to
justify both the proposed and budget fumehood schedules for occupied
hours and provide detailed laboratory usage schedules that are both
reasonable and defensible. The budget and proposed building should have
the same ventilation rates for regularly unoccupied periods. If any of
the zones are internally load driven, the potential energy savings from
reducing the ventilation requirements must account for the possibility
of higher ventilation rate requirements imposed by internal loads.

      ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURE 4:
      The ECM proposal does not contain sufficient detail from which to
make an informed determination. It is likely that it will be allowed
during LEED certification review if ASHRAE 90.1 Section 11.5 guidance is
followed (i.e., provide theoretical and empirical information verifying
accuracy). Also consider this alternative approach: the lab could be
modeled as a 100% outside air system for the baseline case but as a
recirculating system for the proposed design. The outside air quantities
and relief quantities for the office space would be modeled as
identical. The fan power and schedule would be identical for the supply
and exhaust systems for laboratory and office areas. To model the
cascading system in the proposed design, the laboratory system
recirculates the volume of relief air that would be cascaded from the
office space to the laboratory space. The total amount of outside air
drawn into the building is reduced in the proposed design by the amount
of relief air that is cascaded from the office occupancy to the
laboratory. The outside air ventilation volumes and exhaust volumes are
identical for the two cases (the outside air discrepancy is due to a
make-up air, rather than a ventilation air requirement).

Subject: [bldg-sim] Climate Zones and Glass Properties
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200502021436.AA363231pd80000543745@gard.com>

Since several buildings have been designed (and are still being
designed) with glass percentages greater than 50% and up to 80%, I am
sending this message again.

 

What is the basis for envelope properties for vertical glass in
different climate zones?  

Ex: climate zone tables B-11, B-12, B-13, B-16, B-17 & B-19  for 50%
glass in STD-90-2001.

 

B-10    HDD65=2701-3600    CDD50=5401 +          U-fixed=0.46
SHGC-all=0.19

B-11    HDD65=2701-3600    CDD50=3601-5400    U-fixed=0.46
SHGC-all=0.27     Atlanta, GA

B-12    HDD65=2701-3600    CDD50=0-3600          U-fixed=0.73
SHGC-all=0.39

B-13    HDD65=3601-5400    CDD50=3601 +          U-fixed=0.46
SHGC-all=0.25

B-16    HDD65=5401-7200    CDD50=3601 +          U-fixed=0.46
SHGC-all=0.23

B-17    HDD65=5401-7200    CDD50=1801-3600    U-fixed=0.46
SHGC-all=0.26     Chicago, IL

B-19    HDD65=7201-9000    CDD50=1801 +          U-fixed=0.46
SHGC-all=0.26

 

SC = SHGC / 0.85 approx.  

U-Operable = U-fixed + 0.01 approx.  Ex: U-fixed = 0.46, U-operable =
0.47 for zone B-17.

 

Should there be an infiltration rate based on varying annual outdoor air
temperatures and building types associated with fixed (pressurized
buildings) windows and operable windows?  AAMA (American Architectural
Manufacturers Association) 101-85 for Heavy Commercial grade fixed
window specifies air infiltration of 0.06 cfm per ft2 area of outside
frame dimension at 6.24 psf pressure.  10CFR435 indicates 0.15 cfm/ft2
for fixed windows.  Neither document shows the outside-inside
temperature and height of building basis for the infiltration.

 

ASHRAE Standard 90 shows a different glass SHGC for the North exposure.
Example SHGC-north = 0.36 and SHGC-all = 0.26 for climatic zone B-17
(Chicago).  For buildings that have the same glass on all sides can we
use the weighted average SHGC?  Example:  Weighted average SHGC =
(0.26*3 + 0.36)/4 = 0.285.  Is the north orientation limited to 0
degrees (DOE2 program or180 degrees ASHRAE) or can it be a range from
316 degrees clockwise through 0 degrees to 44 degrees.

  

I have not looked at the new STD90-2004 climate zone envelope properties
yet, but the map shows locations on the sea coast and locations inside
the continent belonging to the same climate zone.  Glasgow, U.K. is 56
degrees latitude and the annual temperature range is +25 F to +75 F, and
Minneapolis, USA is 45 degrees latitude and the annual temperature range
is -16 F to +91 F.

 

Since energy analysis for Std90 and code compliance requires 8760-hour
weather data, the climatic zones could be based on the actual HDD65 and
CDD50.  The weather data accounts for altitude.  Example, La Paz,
Bolivia is 16 degrees latitude, 13,169 feet elevation and the annual
temperature range is +25 F to +63 F, and Acapulco, Mexico is 16 degrees
latitude, 16 feet elevation and the annual temperature range is +68 F to
+92 F.

 

During preliminary design we assume that energy efficient Low-E double
glass has properties of U = 0.30, SC = 0.35 and VLT = 0.34.  The cost of
glass increases significantly with more efficient glass.  What sort of
glass (manufacturer name and model) would ASHRAE Standard 90 recommend
for buildings that have more than 50% glass in climate zones B-10 and
B-16?  Example: 60% to 75% glass (13.5' floor-floor building with 8' to
10' glass height).

Hi All,
I have 2 different air handling units in a building.
One does 100% recirculation of the return air and the
outdoor air is used to precondition the return air.
The next AHU is a 100% outside air with enthalpy heat
recovery.
I wanted to clarify the method in modelling the two
systems in equest.How does one define 100% recirc with
the outdoor air as the preconditioner and how do I
define a 100% outdoor air system with heat recovery.

Samuel,
 
I am guessing you are trying to create a utility rate in the detailed mode.  To start I suggest that within the wizard you select one of the California TOU utility rates.  When you get to the detailed mode you will have a good example of all the components you need to create for your own utility rate.  Even better you can just change the rate that is created.  You pick the utility rate on the first wizard screen, I suggest SDG&E AL - TOUa1.  
 
As far as access to the water side systems in the wizard,  you need to first select an air-side system that has water coils.  The default system is a furnace system with DX cooling.
 
There is also an eQuest tutorial on the DOE2.com website which addresses how to go through and create a project using the wizard.  If you haven't looked at that I recommend it as a good place to start.

Dear list users, 

I'm sorry to post what it seems a simple question. 
In the electric utility charges, using time of use charges, when typing the demand and energy cost for on/off peak i'm not able to specify under dollar cost per Kw (or kwh). In fact it turns automatically to thousands or millions. No problem if I use uniform charges. Also in DD wizard I can't acces to water side heating, only to air side systems. It's probably my fault but I've tried almost everything with no positive results.

In order to solve all this beguiner's doubts I've searched the net for any eQUEST examples, and I didn't found any. Looking in eQUEST and DOE documentation wasn?t of much help either. I can't attend any eQUEST, DOE meetings since they are mostly held in USA and I?m in Europe. Any doubt turns out to be a hard, time consuming problem. So maybe it would be an excellent idea to create a  database of eQUEST?s examples, ranging from simple to more complicated ones, or divided in sectors, types of buildings, regional contructions solutions... Don't need to be the latest super complicated projects, just projects that could be shared, maybe using a creative commons license. I think it would help list discussion also, but it's just an idea...

Thanks anyway,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200502020727.AA2747484pd80000542996@gard.com>

Dear list users,

I'm sorry to post what it seems a simple question. 
In the electric utility charges, using time of use charges, when typing
the demand and energy cost for on/off peak i'm not able to specify under
dollar cost per Kw (or kwh). In fact it turns automatically to thousands
or millions. No problem if I use uniform charges. Also in DD wizard I
can't acces to water side heating, only to air side systems. It's
probably my fault but I've tried almost everything with no positive
results.

In order to solve all this beguiner's doubts I've searched the net for
any eQUEST examples, and I didn't found any. Looking in eQUEST and DOE
documentation wasn?t of much help either. I can't attend any eQUEST, DOE
meetings since they are mostly held in USA and I?m in Europe. Any doubt
turns out to be a hard, time consuming problem. So maybe it would be an
excellent idea to create a  database of eQUEST?s examples, ranging from
simple to more complicated ones, or divided in sectors, types of
buildings, regional contructions solutions
 Don't need to be the latest
super complicated projects, just projects that could be shared, maybe

also, but it's just an idea

[bldg-sim] Ice storage system in eQuestFirst, if you use the wizards, you must change to "detailed edit" mode
to get access to the full interactive DOE-2 program input (BDL) and
then create/delete the needed/unwanted equipment.

Create your building with the wizard using WLHP system,
- switch to detail mode
- In the water-side module,right-click on the root entry of the component tree
  (the project: 'name' item) and create a "ground loop heat exchanger" (be ready to
  supply complete ground well/trench design information) attaching it to the WLHP
  circulation-loop
- delete any dedicated fluid cooler pump - not the WLHP loop - mostly will not exist in
   wizard created projects
- delete the fluid cooler (if it not to run in parallel with the GLHX, see
   DOE-2 manuals for details on this option) 
-  delete any dedicated (attached) boiler pump - not the WLHP loop - important
    that you do this so that an "unattached" pump does not remain after you next
    delete the boiler.
-  delete the boiler 
- create BOTH heating and cooling design days (this is required for a decent
   GLHX simulation as the design days are used to initialize the ground field
   temperature history - an annual history is needed due to long term ground
   response); do this by right clicking on the project: entry of the component
   tree in the Project & Site module

Next you need to convert the zonal HP units to be "extended range" units that
can tolerate low and high loop temperatures without shutdown due to temperature
limits for compressor protection.  You can do this manually, but we have posted
an "import" file for eQUEST that makes most of the changes for you.

First, extract the following linked file into your eQUEST projects directory.
   http://doe2.com/download/equest/GroundLoopHP_curves.zip
- file/import the extracted file, SKIP the pre-processing step (click 'No")
   to prevent precessing errors by that process (otherwise you import of this
   file may not work correctly)
- save then re-open the project to force all defaults from the import
   process to take effect (this step is temporarily needed prior to an eQUEST
   update scheduled for later this month)

  Subject: [bldg-sim] Procedure of modeling GSHP in eQUEST and hourly zone/coil loads


  Dear bldg-sim users:

  I have two questions with regard to eQUEST. Is there anyone can help me out?

  (1). As I know, eQUEST has the capability of simulating GSHP, but it has to be done in the detailed mode. I'm wondering whether there is any documentation, or even better, example to show how to build a GSHP simulation in eQUEST?

  (2). Can eQUEST report hourly zone loads and coil loads? If so, how to do it? 

  Thanks in advance,

  Xiaobing

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200502011630.AA3010328pd80000542045@gard.com>

How were the envelope (particularly vertical glass) properties for
different climatic zones determined?  

Example - climatic zone tables B-11, B-12, B-13, B-16, B-17 and B-19 in
STD-90-2001.

 

B-10    HDD65=2701-3600    CDD50=5401 +          U-fixed=0.46
SHGC-all=0.19

B-11    HDD65=2701-3600    CDD50=3601-5400    U-fixed=0.46
SHGC-all=0.27

B-12    HDD65=2701-3600    CDD50=0-3600          U-fixed=0.73
SHGC-all=0.39

B-13    HDD65=3601-5400    CDD50=3601 +          U-fixed=0.46
SHGC-all=0.25

B-16    HDD65=5401-7200    CDD50=3601 +          U-fixed=0.46
SHGC-all=0.23

B-17    HDD65=5401-7200    CDD50=1801-3600    U-fixed=0.46
SHGC-all=0.26

B-19    HDD65=7201-9000    CDD50=1801 +          U-fixed=0.46
SHGC-all=0.26

 

What sort of glass (manufacturer name and model) would ASHRAE Standard
90 recommend for buildings that have more than 50% glass in climatic
zones B-10 and B-16?  Example - 60% to 75% glass (13.5' floor-floor, 8'
to 10' glass height).

 

I have not looked at STD90-2004 climatic zone envelope properties yet,
but the map shows locations on the sea coast and locations inside the
continent belonging to the same climatic zone.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Geothermal heat pump system
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200502011555.AA5557234pd80000541975@gard.com>

I am in the process of modeling a Geothermal Heat Pump system in DOE2.1E, using the following:

SYSTEM = HP
BASEBOARD-SOURCE = HEAT-PUMP
HEAT SOURCE = HEAT-PUMP
HP-SUPP-SOURCE = ELECTRIC

HP-LOOP-HEATING = FROM-GROUND
HP-LOOP-COOLING = FROM-GROUND

The results indicate that heating is not coming on.  Report SS-O shows many 
underheated hours.  
Does anybody know how to model this?

thanks in advance!
