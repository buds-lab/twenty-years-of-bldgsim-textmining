Subject: [Bldg-sim] why pump consume less energy
Message-ID: <000901cbab3c$c66eaac0$534c0040$@com>

Dear all

         My proposed model consume much less pump energy which is less than
1% of the total energy. There are 10 chiller and 10 pumps(all are VSD) in
the proposed. The figure below shows the breakdown of total energy
consumption, the pump is very low. The pump setting is shown in the second
figure below. 

Why the loop head is given in the SIM file as shown in the third figure
below? Why the pump consume little energy? Can anyone tell me the reason?
Thanks a lot. 

 

 
Yours arron

Hi !
 
I think pump motor efficiency(=1) is too high, and it seems CW loop pumps are missing.

All,

 

Happy New Year!

 

I know that I recently asked the question shown below; however I did not
receive any replies so I thought I would try again seeing as how it's a
brand new year.  The question as previously asked:  

 

 

I am curious to know what programs/methodologies people have used to
effectively model the following types of energy recovery systems:

 

1.)     Dual Wheel Heat Recovery with a Cooling Coil between the wheels.
This system is similar to the SEMCO Pinnacle system. As the outdoor air
travels through the air handler it passes first through a total energy
wheel, then through a cooling coil and then through a passive
dehumidification wheel.  The exhaust air, as it leaves the building,
travels through the passive dehumidification wheel and then the total
energy wheel.

 

2.)    Twice through Heat Recovery with a Cooling Coil in between the
first and second pass.  This system is similar to a DesertAire system.
The outside air passes through the heat recovery device, through a
cooling coil, and then through the other side of the same heat recovery
device thus pre-cooling the outdoor air and reheating the supply air.

 

Please see the attached PDF for very simple schematic sketches of each
option.

 

Thanks,

 

Adam

Hello Adam,

I haven't really simulated Energy recovery systems in such details. But I
believe ApacheHVAC module in IES VE could probably simulate the two systems.
The energy wheels can be represented by "Heat Recovery" item in ApacheHVAC
where inputs of sensible efficiency, latent efficiency as well as electrical
power consumption are necessary. For system A, two "Hear Recovery" items
are needed so that the total energy wheel and passive dehumidification wheel
can be modeled separately. Additional controllers may be necessary to
simulate the dehumidification wheel. Meanwhile, heat or cooling coil can be
placed in the air stream accordingly.

Regards,

Cheney

Dear Adam,

 

Unless you?re very tightly connected to SEMCO, you?ll have to invent the passive dehumidification part of the Pinnacle unit.  I don?t think that SEMCO has published anything like tech performance data for that wheel.  It is NOT a standard energy recovery wheel.

We have modelled similar systems by using traditional simulation to get the off-coil and on-coil conditions.  We dump these to an hourly spreadsheet and model the psychrometrics there.  We use the ASHRAE toolkit if wel feel necessary to model wet coils robustly etc.  Many simulation programs assume a constant bypass (or contact) factor when in fact this is dynamic.  I believe this is significnt to take into account with the types of systems decribed in humid climates.  I haven't seen a simulation programe that can model your systems correctly but then I have only been exposed to EQuest (DOE-2.2), IES VE, TAS, HAP.  I suspect TRNSYS may allow you to model it, but if you aren't already using it would you not be better off spending the time on a robust spreadsheet template ... good luck.

Hello,

I am currently filling-up my LEED Template , in Table 1.3 - Advisory Messages, I 
am not sure how to fill up the Number of hours cooling loads not met because my 
BEPS report shows that I have "Percent of hours any system zone outside of 
throttling range = 1.6" and "Percent of hours any plant load not satisfied = 
2.3"
Do I just list the hours of system load not met 140 hrs (1.6 x 8760/100) or do I 
need to also include the plant not met hours? 


Thanks,

Jaigath

Message-ID: <fb21d4cc7f54.4d22fab7@iit.edu>

I bought the APEC (Automated Procedures for Engineering Consultants) APEC programs as memorabilia when it folded up in 2002.  APEC was founded in 1965.  The APEC HCC-V (Heating & Cooling Calculations version V) program can still be used.  At SOM it was used until 2002.  
I was able to install and run the HCC-V program on a 32-bit computer but not the 64-bit computer.  Does anyone know how to fix a 32-bit program to run on a 64-bit computer.  I have the source code.
HCC-V is based on the TETD method.  If you don't know what a decrement factor is, enter 0.5 (the range 0 to 1).  For an office bldg that closes at 6 PM make the time lag 3 hours (HCC assumes the peak hour is 3 PM) so that it affects the building during office hours.
You can find information about the APEC HCC-V program in the website

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ECM for LEED for Kitchen Exhaust
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=nVZZTu07fdDybtQhcH1VqtDRqJ1noJp7=oorj@mail.gmail.com>

We are modeling a small fast food restaurant for LEED certification and need
clarification regarding LEED's Exceptional Calculation Method.

According to the Reference Guide, the Exceptional Calculation Method (ECM)
allows for the documentation of "any measures that cannot be adequately
modeled in a simulation program." It gives some examples that would warrant
an ECM including improvements to laboratory or kitchen exhaust systems.

Our building uses an improved kitchen exhaust hood that allows for a
reduction in exhaust airflow. The airflow reduction was calculated by the
hood manufacturer. Because this is a component of the HVAC system and
directly affects the sizing of the heating and cooling systems, our initial
Proposed model simulated the kitchen exhaust hood with the lower airflow, as
designed, without using an ECM. This seemed reasonable, as the exhaust hood
is a measure that can be adequately modeled by the software. The Baseline
model used a higher exhaust cfm that was determined by the hood
manufacturer, and the Appendix G fan power calculations.

The LEED reviewer's response was to use an ECM to document energy savings
associated with the hood. However, the dilemma we are encountering is that
Appendix G requires the Proposed model's HVAC system to be modeled as
designed. It also requires the outdoor air (hood makeup air) to be identical
in both models.

Below are some of the scenarios we've considered.

Option A.)
Proposed Model: Use the theoretical higher exhaust cfm, exhaust fan power as
designed, HVAC sizing and capacity as required for the additional exhaust
airflow.
Baseline Model: Use the same exhaust airflow as the Proposed, Appendix G fan
power and HVAC sizing and capacity.
ECM: Proposed Model re-simulated with the lower exhaust cfm as designed,
exhaust fan power as designed, HVAC sizing and capacity as designed, with
the energy savings provided in the LEED template.
Problems: This option does not allow the HVAC system of the Proposed model
to be modeled as designed. The increase in exhaust air increases the makeup
air requirement, thereby increasing the heating and cooling loads.

Option B.)
Proposed Model: Use the lower exhaust cfm as designed, exhaust fan power as
designed, HVAC sizing and capacity as designed.
Baseline Model: Use the same exhaust cfm as the Proposed, Appendix G fan
power and HVAC sizing and capacity.
ECM: Baseline Model re-simulated with the higher exhaust cfm, with the
energy increase provided in the LEED template.
Problems: From my understanding, an ECM is designed to show energy savings
for a particular measure rather than an energy increase to the Baseline for
not using the measure.

Does anyone have experience with a similar situation?

Thanks,

Karen

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Interpretation of erv exception - appendix G
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=Q_mnHRZwk=k3=uKP=0xtPovdm5Vvqnw9hbLZ2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I am simulating a building in climate zone 2A. The baseline system, which
does both heating and cooling, has 70% or more OA at design condition and
supply cfm ismore than 5000 cfm. The exception says that

exhaust air energy recovery shall not be included in the
*

baseline building design.
*

(d) Heating systems in climate zones 1 through 3.

(e) Cooling systems in climate zones 3c, 4c, 5b, 5c, 6b,

7, and 8.

My question is - do I include a erv in baseline system just for cooling, or
no erv needs to be included?

Thanks

Rohini

Hello Rohini,

My understanding is, since zone 2A is cooling dominated area, ERV for
cooling (at least 50%) should be included whereas that for heating can be
ignored in the baseline model when you have >5000cfm and 70% fulfilled in
your design.

  Regards,

Cheney

Thanks for all the replies saying it should work with Windows-7. My computer has Windows Vista.  I also got replies saying that they got the APEC HCC-V program to work on their 64-bit computer.   It seems the APEC HCC-V is still being used.  The program is in FORTRAN-66 and the first version (an input interface was added later) was issued in the late 1960s
I have uploaded the two APEC HCC-V  installation disks into http://bepan.info   I have also uploaded the EXCEL templates that generates tables and charts from DOE2.bin.  
I will upload the other original files and executable programs to the website after I know where this going.  I cannot take responsibility for public access to the website.  
I developed the information for graduate courses and the Ph.D. program at IIT while I was a full time employee at SOM.  The Ph.D. candidates who worked with me and Ray Clark (former Partner & Director of MEP at SOM and is now Adjunct at IIT) have the information.  They are now assistant/associate professors at other universities.  They are going to use it as reference to develop their own courses and we will be working with them.

HCC-V is based on the TETD method.  If you don't know what a decrement factor is, enter 0.5 (the range 0 to 1).  For an office bldg that closes at 6 PM make the time lag 3 hours (HCC assumes the peak hour is 3 PM) so that it affects the building during office hours.

Chuck,

  I'm trying to simulate models located on Campinas,Sp, a Brazilian city
(near *SBKP* station).I made that point because I wonder if the Real Data
Weather has the same kind of data than a METAR code, used for aviation. Or
if it have the same number of variables in a commom .EPW file, used for
simulate buildings. A METAR code is quite simple than a EPW file

  I would appreciate it if you could send me data from Campinas,SP - Brazil.

Sorry about my bad english.

Francisco.

Francisco,

Unfortunately it is far more complex than that.  While there is a great deal of overlap in the data from a METAR station and the data in an EPW file it is in a very different format and also it is highly unlikely that this SBKB station has all of the sensors necessary to produce that needed for EnergyPlus, particularly in the area of solar radiation...not to mention to have a statistically valid sample you should have 30 years of data  

We will soon be charging for this data ? a TMY (.EPW) file for a specific site ? but since we can produce these for anywhere, I will run our system and send you this file under separate cover.

Chuck

Francisco,

.EPW is a format that is for one full year of hourly weather data for a defined set of weather variables utilized in its model (and others).  While this can be any specific year it is typically a Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) constructed by statistically selecting 12 most ?representative? months from 30 years of hourly data.  If you are looking for a .EPW (TMY) file we are about to announce a new system which will make these available for nearly anywhere.  Happy to explain more about the weather input to energyplus or provide samples if it helps.

Arpan,

      The base for the historical output is the NOAA/NCEP/CFSR data set descried in the recent article 
      in the August 2010 Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society available at - http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/suppl/10.1175/2010BAMS3001.1
      This is a very comprehensive integration of 30 years of hourly forecast data re-analyzed (basically recalculated using all available observation data (land, sea, air and space) of what actually happened.  We have done a substantial amount of post-processing of this data to make it usable, put a front end on it to make it accessible and put a delivery back end on it to add in things like TMY (.EPW) generation.

      Since the Virtual weather stations we create also do very localized current conditions and 7-day hourly forecasts (what we think will be needed for building energy monitoring and management), the system also takes in all of the NOAA global and regional forecasts and all available hourly weather station ground observations and integrates them every hour to give very precise localized output.   So all of our virtual stations will have gap free hourly data from 30+ years back to 7 days ahead.  We can produce the files and forecasts now and with luck this will all be available for direct access on line by announcement time later this month.

      Does this help?

      Chuck

I am trying to understand how your sensor point system works. The weather stations are not physical but virtual? This means the data is interpolated using satellites and mathematical models?

Adam,

We have also used spreadsheet calculations on the side for dual wheel energy recovery systems with coils between the wheels. Neither eQUEST nor Trane TRACE will model this type of system. When the coils have chilled water or hot water that we want to have TRACE (or eQUEST) include in the chilled water and hot water plants, we have the spreadsheet calculate the hourly cooling and heating coil loads, which can then be input into TRACE (or eQUEST) as  hourly load profiles assigned to the respective plants.

Semco also has a spreadsheet calculator for the Pinnacle and other products on their website. It?s kind of hidden?

Go to www.semcoinc.com<http://www.semcoinc.com>.
On the far left side select ?Energy Recovery Products.?
On the far left side select ?Pinnacle? (or whichever product you want)
Scroll down to the box at the bottom labeled ?Product Library.?
In the ?Select a category? field in the upper right corner of the box select ?Selection Software.?
Click on the spreadsheet icon and save the spreadsheet wherever you want.

There are a few quirky things to be aware of?

The natural gas utility cost is in units of $ per million BTU, which is 10 times $ per therm.

The cooling source kW/ton is for the entire system, including any pumps and cooling towers.

Electric consumption (kWh) is not calculated directly, but you can get it indirectly by setting the utility cost as $1 per kWh and $0 for everything else. Then the dollar amount shown matches the kWh. The gas consumption can be calculated indirectly in a similar way by entering $1 per million BTU (or $1000 to get more significant figures) and $0 for everything else. The same trick does not work for kW. I don?t remember why.

In the past we have experienced a problem with the Pinnacle spreadsheet not showing any change when the external static pressure is changed, so we did fan power calculations on the side. A quick check with the latest spreadsheet shows a change. Perhaps my original change from long ago was not significant enough to increase the cost by $1. (Some of my clients have very cheap electricity, which makes implementing efficiency tough sometimes!)

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Modeling different Energy Recovery Scenarios

We have modelled similar systems by using traditional simulation to get the off-coil and on-coil conditions.  We dump these to an hourly spreadsheet and model the psychrometrics there.  We use the ASHRAE toolkit if wel feel necessary to model wet coils robustly etc.  Many simulation programs assume a constant bypass (or contact) factor when in fact this is dynamic.  I believe this is significnt to take into account with the types of systems decribed in humid climates.  I haven't seen a simulation programe that can model your systems correctly but then I have only been exposed to EQuest (DOE-2.2), IES VE, TAS, HAP.  I suspect TRNSYS may allow you to model it, but if you aren't already using it would you not be better off spending the time on a robust spreadsheet template ... good luck.

All,

Happy New Year!

I know that I recently asked the question shown below; however I did not receive any replies so I thought I would try again seeing as how it???s a brand new year.  The question as previously asked:


I am curious to know what programs/methodologies people have used to effectively model the following types of energy recovery systems:

1.)   Dual Wheel Heat Recovery with a Cooling Coil between the wheels.  This system is similar to the SEMCO Pinnacle system. As the outdoor air travels through the air handler it passes first through a total energy wheel, then through a cooling coil and then through a passive dehumidification wheel.  The exhaust air, as it leaves the building, travels through the passive dehumidification wheel and then the total energy wheel.

2.)     Twice through Heat Recovery with a Cooling Coil in between the first and second pass.  This system is similar to a DesertAire system. The outside air passes through the heat recovery device, through a cooling coil, and then through the other side of the same heat recovery device thus pre-cooling the outdoor air and reheating the supply air.

Please see the attached PDF for very simple schematic sketches of each option.

Thanks,

Adam

Message-ID: <550250.50883.qm@web32104.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello All,

I have a LEED project modeling for the baseline of air-to-air heat pump system with electrical auxiliary heat. In G3.1.3.1 of ASHRAE 90.1-2007, the requirement is "The systems are controlled
with multistage space thermostats and an outdoor air thermostat activate
electric heat only on the last thermostat stage and the outdoor air temperature
is 40 oF and below.".

In my DOE2.2 model, the electrical heat is activated only when the outdoor air temperature is below 40 oF. But meanwhile is the air-to-air heat pump system still running or turned off? From the description above we cannot find proof whether it is still running or shut off. I looked up other materials such as the ASHRARE 90.1-2007 user manual or Advanced Energy Modeling For LEED Technical Manual and none mentioned the heat pump is continuously run when the outdoor air temperature is below 40 F. 

Does anyone have any good insight on this? Thanks for you help.

Regards,

David

This is an issue we've tried to resolve as well as it doesn't appear to be explicitly addressed in 90.1.  To complicate issues, it is hard to find this data from many manufacturers.   As a result we have applied standard practice to the baseline model which says that a typical heat pump can operate to about 5?F (-15?C) before its COP is equivalent to just electric resistance heating.  So if you are using eQUEST, you can set the Maximum HP Supp Temp to 40?F and the Minimum HP Temp to 5?F and the heat pump will ramp down between the two set points.  There is a pretty informative article provided by Natural Resources Canada that details out some of these parameters (http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/publications/infosource/pub/home/heating-heat-pump/asheatpumps.cfm)

The standard 90.1 imposes a maximum percentage of glazed area of the gross

to understand what was the groundwork/genesis for these percentages values
contribution, ore where they came from.

 

Vertical Fenestration

Vertical fenestration areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that
in the proposed design or 40% window-to-wall ratio of gross above-grade wall
area, whichever is smaller, and shall be distributed on each face of the
building in the same proportions in the proposed design

 

Skylights and Glazed Smoke Vents

Skylight area shall be equal to that in the proposed building design or 5%
of the gross roof area that is part of the building envelope, whichever is
smaller. If the skylight area of the proposed building design is greater
than 5% of the gross roof area, baseline skylight area shall be decreased by
an identical percentage in all roof components in which skylights are
located to reach the 5% skylight-to-roof ratio.

 

Thanks in advance for all your help

Hi,

Has anyone used EE4 before?  It's a Canadian compliance software
program.  

I've modeled a Combination Ground Source Heat Pump and Parallel boiler,
but the program requires that "the heating airflow temperature must
always be lower than the cooling airflow temperature."  Of course, with
my heating setpoint at 60F, and my cooling at 65F, I've got hundreds of
unmet hours.  I've put the zone heating capacities at unrealistically
high values to try to make up the heat, but that's not working either.


Has anyone encountered this problem before, or know why this constraint
is in place?  

Thank you,

Katherine

Sounds like you're using a fan coils with a make-up air unit.  The heating and cooling setpoints entered at the system level is for tempering the make-up air only.

The reason for the unmet hours is likely that your terminal airflow is not large enough.  The air will only be heated to a maximum supply temperature (43?C?) so you can't get the output unless terminal airflow is also increased.

Regards,
Kyle

In addition to  UK building projects, the talk but will also include work Malcolm  completed as part of the design of the LEED Gold award winning Harm A.  Weber Academic Center at Judson University, in Elgin, near Chicago. This  building, which comprises office and library space, adopts a hybrid  ventilation and cooling strategy which exploits the maximum benefit from  natural ventilation before reverting to   air-conditioning during the harsh winter and peak summer months.  Results during t

Message-ID: <88DC4C3C646DD5119B0D0002A537FD68181F872E@madison.corp.epstein-isi.com>

Hello all,

 

I am working on a project that needs some guidance from you all!

 

The project consists of 3 office buildings and 1 dining hall/auditorium building in a corporate campus environment. The buildings are being designed and constructed via 3 phased stages with Phase 1 containing 1 office building and the dining hall/auditorium building, Phase 2 with 1 office building, and Phase 3 for the final office building. The dining hall/auditorium building contains a campus chilled water system that is to serve air handling units for each of the office buildings as well as the amenities building itself.

 

We plan on submitting each phase's buildings as separate projects under an umbrella of a master site since it is a corporate campus environment. Because the District Energy System (DES) is within one of the Phase 1 buildings, we referred to page 7 of USGBC's  "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2 and LEED 2009 - Design & Construction" for guidance:

 

Downstream equipment - all heating or cooling systems, equipment, and controls located within the LEED project building and/or on the project site associated with transporting the thermal energy of the DES into heated or cooled spaces. This includes the thermal connection or interface with the DES, secondary distribution systems in the building, and terminal units. 

Exception: When the building housing the thermal energy plant is itself seeking LEED certification, then the project shall treat the DES equipment as "downstream equipment" for the following prerequisites and credits: 

* EA prerequisite 1 

* EA prerequisite 2 

o Mandatory Measures: The district energy equipment shall comply with all mandatory measures from ASHRAE 90.1-2004. 

o Prescriptive Method: The district energy equipment shall comply with any applicable prescriptive requirements 

o Performance Method: The district energy equipment shall be modeled as upstream equipment, NOT downstream equipment. USGBC recommends that such projects use modeling Option 2 (described below). 

* EA prerequisite 3 

* EA credit 3 

* EA credit 4 

* EA credit 5 

 

Unfortunately, the statements contradict each other. If the equipment is to be treated as "downstream equipment", then I have to include all the chillers, boilers, pumps, etc. However, if the equipment is to be treated as "upstream equipment", I just create virtual chillers/boilers with some efficiencies based on Table 4 on page 12:

 

Table 4: Energy Source for Option 2 District heating 

Baseline 

On-site heating plant or fossil fuel furnaces as defined in ASHRAE 90.1 Appx. G, tables G3.1.1A and G3.1.1B, representing code minimum efficiency2 

Proposed 

Virtual on-site hot water or steam boiler representing upstream DH system 

District cooling 

Baseline 

On-site cooling plant or packaged cooling as defined in ASHRAE 90.1 Appx. G, tables G3.1.1A and G3.1.1B, representing code minimum efficiency3 

Proposed 

Virtual on-site chiller representing upstream DC system 

 

Phase 2 and 3 buildings will be straight forward on the energy modeling because we will have to model virtual systems to simulate the DES since it is physically outside of the LEED project. How have you interpreted this before with the DES within the LEED building that is attempting LEED certification and which approach would you use in modeling using eQuest?

Chris:

Maybe I am missing something. I would interpret a LEED model as a building that 
has applied to for a LEED certification, but may not yet have been built (or as 
an existing building, ?remodeled to LEED criteria). I have neve heard of an 
"Energy Intensity" model. A "Real" building is an existing building that has 
utility bills and/or submetering to match.

Perhaps not what you were looking for..

Adam,

If there?s an answer it might be here: http://www.cmu.edu/iwess/publications/index.html#ventilation

Chaoqin Zhai wrote her dissertation on a Semco ventilation system that included a pair of wheels at Carnegie Mellon University while I was there writing mine. However, I believe this system used an active desiccant wheel with a total energy wheel.

There are several of her publications, which included input from folks at Semco, at the bottom of the link.

Good luck,

Fred

Dear Adam,

Unless you?re very tightly connected to SEMCO, you?ll have to invent the passive dehumidification part of the Pinnacle unit.  I don?t think that SEMCO has published anything like tech performance data for that wheel.  It is NOT a standard energy recovery wheel.

We have modelled similar systems by using traditional simulation to get the off-coil and on-coil conditions.  We dump these to an hourly spreadsheet and model the psychrometrics there.  We use the ASHRAE toolkit if wel feel necessary to model wet coils robustly etc.  Many simulation programs assume a constant bypass (or contact) factor when in fact this is dynamic.  I believe this is significnt to take into account with the types of systems decribed in humid climates.  I haven't seen a simulation programe that can model your systems correctly but then I have only been exposed to EQuest (DOE-2.2), IES VE, TAS, HAP.  I suspect TRNSYS may allow you to model it, but if you aren't already using it would you not be better off spending the time on a robust spreadsheet template ... good luck.

All,

Happy New Year!

I know that I recently asked the question shown below; however I did not receive any replies so I thought I would try again seeing as how it???s a brand new year.  The question as previously asked:


I am curious to know what programs/methodologies people have used to effectively model the following types of energy recovery systems:

1.)   Dual Wheel Heat Recovery with a Cooling Coil between the wheels.  This system is similar to the SEMCO Pinnacle system. As the outdoor air travels through the air handler it passes first through a total energy wheel, then through a cooling coil and then through a passive dehumidification wheel.  The exhaust air, as it leaves the building, travels through the passive dehumidification wheel and then the total energy wheel.

2.)     Twice through Heat Recovery with a Cooling Coil in between the first and second pass.  This system is similar to a DesertAire system. The outside air passes through the heat recovery device, through a cooling coil, and then through the other side of the same heat recovery device thus pre-cooling the outdoor air and reheating the supply air.

Please see the attached PDF for very simple schematic sketches of each option.

Thanks,

Adam

Message-ID: <E52D1AEF5C5D364281BD7ADE1FDC0CE0973BF4D286@mamail.mazzetti.com>

Hi all,

Is there a place in 90.1-2007 that defines certain numbers for Baseline pressure drop? 
(I've gone through the archives and addendum ac to 90.1-2004 that was incorporated in the 2007 version and can't seem to find it, because I guess there isn't such a thing as "baseline pressure drop" definition)

Can somebody chime in on the analogy for the baseline pressure drop indirectly expressed through the Appx G Table-3.1.2.9 Baseline Fan Brake Horsepower:
-I choose the type of the system (Constant or Variable)
-Per note below Table G3.1.2.9 I go back to Section 6.5.3.1.1 and define the "A" parameter in the calc
-I add all the pressure drop adjustments that apply to my applicable device for that particular system and add them to the baseline system fan power to get credit when compared to my proposed case fan power(pressure drop)?

...where I'm going with this; it's a bit confusing to use the baseline CFM and pressure drop adjustments from the proposed model to get the total baseline brake horsepower or maybe it's just Friday..

Thanks,
Nikola

Hello everyone,

I have a question regarding adiabatic floor. I am working on energy modeling for a 3 storey building, in which each storey was created as a separate shell by selecting adiabatic roof type for level 1 and level 2. In the model, I also have a plenum space to serve the below zones. Please advice if I need to change floor type from adiabatic to standard in detail edit mode. 

Thanks in advance.

Hi Sunayana,

It sounds like you're using eQuest, but please clarify if not:

For a three-shell, three-story building, I would suggest an adiabatic
floor type for the 2nd and 3rd floor shells while in the DD wizards.
Any other selection for a distinct shell will result in floor perimeter
loads appropriate to a slab-on-grade or else a floor exposed to exterior
conditions, neither of which sounds like an intended feature of your
building.

Regards,

~Nick

Hello everyone,

I have a question regarding adiabatic floor. I am working on energy
modeling for a 3 storey building, in which each storey was created as a
separate shell by selecting adiabatic roof type for level 1 and level 2.
In the model, I also have a plenum space to serve the below zones.
Please advice if I need to change floor type from adiabatic to standard
in detail edit mode. 

Thanks in advance.

It sounds like you've got the right idea Nikola - must have just been a
Friday...

It does make sense if you dwell on it enough:  If your proposed system
has a ton of extra filtering to deal with, it wouldn't be fair if the
corresponding baseline fan were sized with a bhp appropriate to minimal
filtering, would it?  If you add up all the items that apply to your
proposed system from T 6.5.3.1.1B when figuring out your 'A' parameter -
increasing the energy consumption of the baseline system fan, then
you're effectively leveling the playing field for your proposed system.

90.1 is set up a little strangely in that we have to follow all these
sub-notes and bounce around the chapters to reference all the correct
tables, but I think you're following the right path.

Regards,

~Nick

fan bhp relation

Hi all,

Is there a place in 90.1-2007 that defines certain numbers for Baseline
pressure drop? 
(I've gone through the archives and addendum ac to 90.1-2004 that was
incorporated in the 2007 version and can't seem to find it, because I
guess there isn't such a thing as "baseline pressure drop" definition)

Can somebody chime in on the analogy for the baseline pressure drop
indirectly expressed through the Appx G Table-3.1.2.9 Baseline Fan Brake
Horsepower:
-I choose the type of the system (Constant or Variable)
-Per note below Table G3.1.2.9 I go back to Section 6.5.3.1.1 and define
the "A" parameter in the calc
-I add all the pressure drop adjustments that apply to my applicable
device for that particular system and add them to the baseline system
fan power to get credit when compared to my proposed case fan
power(pressure drop)?

...where I'm going with this; it's a bit confusing to use the baseline
CFM and pressure drop adjustments from the proposed model to get the
total baseline brake horsepower or maybe it's just Friday..

Thanks,
Nikola

Dogan,

We are just about to announce at the American Meteorological Society?s January conference a new system that can get you a TMY file for any site in the world (initially in EPW format but soon also in .BIN for DOE2) constructed from the last 30 years of hourly weather data.  We have essentially placed over 640,000 virtual weather stations, one every 35 km around the globe, each producing gap free hourly time-series weather data for about 25 variables from 1/1/1979 through seven days in the future.  (We have been working on this for some time).

We can get you what ever cities you would like in Saudi Arabia (or anywhere in between).  We are intending to sell this data but if you want to pick a city or even better a specific location, we will send you a TMY for that site at no cost so you can check it out.  


Let me know and I hope we can be of help.

Chuck

Is there a tool out there that allows you to quickly analyze the effect different mechanical systems will have on energy cost savings? It seems that a lot of project teams during the design stages want to know the influence on energy models and ultimately how big of a drop or gain in LEED points certain system changes will have. Ironically, the current process of LEED is analyzing the energy a building consumes based on systems that are already designed...

I often create a number of parametric runs for my clients which compare,
among other things, changes to mechanical systems.  Sometimes creating the
energy model early in the design process requires me to make changes to
zoning, geometry and systems for the final LEED model, but hey, using
modeling to make design decisions is what it was designed to do, isn't it?

In my experience, even after modeling 100's of buildings, there is not
always one good answer for every building.  Changes in space use, occupancy

systems choices (not to mention budgets and available fuels).

Will,
I'd suggest looking into tools like Energy-10 (www.sbicouncil.org) which
allow rapid initial modeling to assess envelope, fenestration and mechanical
tradeoffs.   Energy simulation tools of this type may be limited in directly
modeling many thermal zones or particular HVAC configurations, but do allow
the evaluation of a wide variety of options early in pre-design.

Building Simulation 2011
Driving better design through simulation

Dear David

The BS2011 Organising Committee has great pleasure in inviting you to the Building Simulation 2011 Conference, the 12th bi-annual Conference of the International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA), co-hosted by IBPSA Australasia and Australian Institute of Refrigeration, Air-Conditioning and Heating (AIRAH).
The simulation of building performance is increasingly embedded in the design process through green rating tools, regulation and as a general means of optimising design. Building Simulation 2011 will explore current best practice and new horizons for the use of simulation to drive better building design.

Papers are being sought on the following key topics: Abstracts due by 31 January 2011

*         How simulation can influence the design process

*         The limitations of simulations in practice, and how can these can be addressed

*         Case studies of the use of simulation in practice, and the lessons learnt

*         Use of BIM in simulation

*         Simulation validation and testing

*         Comparing simulation and real-world outcomes

*         Simulation to support commissioning, controls and monitoring

*         Applications of simulation in regulatory processes

*         New work in simulation development

*         Advances in building physics

*         Human aspects of the indoor environment

*         Building services

*         Energy capture and operation

*         Software issues

Message-ID: <AANLkTikecz=khvdHP0LbkAmtX67ecpckXV892LGC4e4K@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

Some of you may know, and some may not, that I have moved from Portland to
Vancouver BC, and accepted a job at Cobalt Engineering. My position here is
Senior Energy Analyst and my job duties will remain much the same as they
always were.

I have been offering eQUEST training to clients with a wide variety of
experience levels for some time now.  I have never felt comfortable with
blatant advertising on the list-serv before, so I tend to answer requests
for training off-line.  At this point in time, however, I don?t think it
serves the list-serv to not provide this information, and I encourage others
to do so too.

Lately, most of what I have been doing are 1-on-1 remote and onsite training
and small group onsite training sessions.  I have used GoToMeeting
successfully for the remote training. In the past, I have also trained
larger groups and am still willing to continue to provide that service, too.
Up until now, I have traveled to the client to provide that training. At
Cobalt, however, we have lovely meeting rooms so if clients wanted to come
to Vancouver, BC, they would be welcome.

By virtue of training small groups of people, the topics we cover are
generally customized to meet the client?s needs. I do not have a set agenda
of items to cover; instead we use an iterative process with the client to
develop an agenda of topics specifically for them. These topics can range
from how and when to create a new shell, how to best use the wizards and
detailed edit modes, how to evaluate defaults, how to create custom curves,
how to read and work in the building description language (BDL) found in the
input file, how to select reports pertinent to a project and how to read
them, and how to use the refrigeration commands.

Our training fees are roughly equivalent to the fees I have seen posted
online and that I have personally paid other trainers to train me. I highly
recommend that you all attend an eQUEST training given by Marlin Addison and
Steve Gates at least once. No one knows eQUEST better than them. I also am
quite sure that the training at the Energy Center of Wisconsin are good, and
based on her patient and thorough answers to your questions online, I am
sure that training provided by Pasha Korber Gonzalez would also be
excellent. Sorry to leave others out, I just don?t have experience with
them.

If any of you want additional information from me, please feel free to email
me at cgardner at cobaltengineering.com, cmg750 at gmail.com, or call me at (604)
687-1800, extension 254.



Best,

Carol Gardner PE

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Tripoli - Libya Climate Zone
Message-ID: <2868B61B17A740409A18C906719BEBB80143E42D@EXC04COL1UK.uk.wspgroup.com>

Hi All,

 

Does anyone know where I can find the climate zone for Tripoli in Libya?

 

I tried to find it in Ashrae 90.1 but it does not seem to be in there.

 

I assumed it would be in climate zone 1, but it could be in climate zone
2.

 

Thanks.

 

Kind Regards

ASHRAE 2009 Fundamentals list Tripoli, Libya as having 8 HDD 10 C / 4016 CDD
10 C.

So, according to Standard 169-2006, that's* Zone 2B (Dry)*  (3500 < CDD 10 C
< 5000).

Dear colleagues,

 

Glare from daylight remains a somewhat underexplored parameter in
contemporary building design. In an attempt to help our students to
start thinking about the problem, we are teaching them HDR photography
and computer-based analysis methods via Radiance/Daysim/Evalglare. We
are now interested in how far you are currently dealing with glare in
your practice (or teaching) and invite you to participate in a survey on
'Glare Analysis and HDR Photography in Contemporary Architectural
Practice'. The survey is conducted as part of a Master's thesis by
Rashida Mogri at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University. It
takes literally five minutes to complete and you may 'reward ' yourself
afterwards by reviewing some of the glare-related material on our web
site at
www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/GlareRecommendationsForPractice.h
tml.

 

To participate in the survey please go to
http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/hdrphotography. Thank you for your time
and interest!

A curious case of no roof conduction recorded in building load  
component reports. Anyone else come across this situation?

The roof surfaces are properly assigned layer-by-layer constructions.

Thank you!

Good afternoon group.

Can anyone out there tell me what the baseline HVAC system assumption is for compliance with PA energy code (2009 IECC, ASHRAE 90.1-2007) for these building types:
Schools
Offices
Nursing Home/Retirement Community?

Even better would be any information on standard industry practice from a baseline study or other PA-specific source.

Thanks much!!

I just learned that the Energy Plus .stat file indicates the climate zone.
If there's a weather file for Tripoli on the E+ Web site, you can download
and check it out.  (The .stat file is text.)

ASHRAE 2009 Fundamentals list Tripoli, Libya as having 8 HDD 10 C / 4016 CDD
10 C.

 

So, according to Standard 169-2006, that's Zone 2B (Dry)  (3500 < CDD 10 C <

Hi All,

 

Does anyone know where I can find the climate zone for Tripoli in Libya?

 

I tried to find it in Ashrae 90.1 but it does not seem to be in there.

 

I assumed it would be in climate zone 1, but it could be in climate zone 2.

 

Thanks.

There is a small software tools published with energyplus - after the
installation of energyplus, you can find it under:

.\energyplus\PreProcess\WeatherConverter\Weather.exe

Then you can use this software converter your .epw file to .stat file. Then
open the .stat file in any text edit tools, you can find the climate zone
for this area.

But I find there will be some gaps between two calculation method:

   - hand calculation in excel and followed the criteria in ASHRAE 90.1


   - the climate zone find from the .stat file which calculates by
   "WeatherConverter"

Until now I still confuse why this could happen. And at last I choose the
result calculated by "WeatherConverter".

Thanks everyone for your comments, this has been very helpful.

 

Does anyone know of an energy benchmark for residential low rise
buildings in Libya?

 

It would be very helpful to have without need to do a full 90.1 model.

 

Thanks.

If modeling for LEED, I would advise seeking out the rate schedules for
the actual local utilities.  It's a little extra work (actually I've
found the EIA site to be a pain to navigate in the past), but I suspect
those averages take into account huge industrial facilities and
government/military organizations with well-discounted rate structures
atypically lower than those used for a typical building owner's bills.
I've found plugging the actual rates in (for a few projects where I made
this comparison) to generally increase the consumption/demand costs
modeled, and often that can cause a better cost-based (i.e. LEED)
performance rating.

My $0.02,

Well, John requested "no caveats"...but...good point Nick, I have done
more work on larger Midwestern facilities, so those have tended to be
consistent with EIA data.  Your example is well taken that a smaller
facility might be expected to be higher than the EIA averages.

John, if the project is for LEED, the USGBC offers the EIA or a published
tariff as alternatives in the reference guide as Nick points out, and you
are certainly within your bounds to explore the options.  If the project
is an addition to an existing campus, you may also have a custom agreement
in place that will cover the project.  Be sure that you can document where
the rate comes from if you use it.

Also some states are deregulated electricity markets (such as Illinois) --
so even though you may find an applicable tariff (on ComEd's website as an
example) there are only a few customers that would use it.  Most larger
clients in these states are purchasing electric commodity through a retail
energy supplier and using only the delivery rate from the utility.

In locations where demand charges are high, a project that takes measures
to reduce peak energy usage and demand could show a higher savings using
the tariff, since the EIA data is flat-rate.  Definitely seek out the
actual information in these locations.

Seeking out actual utility rates is essiential for all the projects I've
been on. The averages from EIA are a good place to start, but often
times the actual rates are far higher, and this will lead to more LEED
points from the same design / engineering changes. I've also found that
using the actual utility rate for the baseline and using a discounted
utility rate that is applicable because of some incentive program is
allowed, and further increases the benefits from the cost-based approach
of LEED energy modeling.

If modeling for LEED, I would advise seeking out the rate schedules for
the actual local utilities.  It's a little extra work (actually I've
found the EIA site to be a pain to navigate in the past), but I suspect
those averages take into account huge industrial facilities and
government/military organizations with well-discounted rate structures
atypically lower than those used for a typical building owner's bills.
I've found plugging the actual rates in (for a few projects where I made
this comparison) to generally increase the consumption/demand costs
modeled, and often that can cause a better cost-based (i.e. LEED)

Hello,
            I am investigating the reason why a zone has a high number of hours 
with heating load unmet. I printed out the hourly report variables from the 
thermal zone [attached]. This zone has a very low internal load hence when the 
thermostat is returned to normal from the setback it does not gain a lot of 
heat. I see that the system is able to supply at the design supply temperature 
of 90 F. However the CFM does not increase beyond the 40% minimum flow ratio. It 
appears that the system is supplying enough energy to meet the instantaneous 
load. However it is not looking to meet the lack of heat due to the heat 
capacity.
 
Could anyone please explain why the program is not calculating a higher supply 
air flow rate that would be required to meet the set point temperature.
 
Thanks,
Kris

John-
The statewide EIA rates are available for free if you are using TRACE 700 (and possibly eQUEST soon, keep reading), I maintain free updated library members (using EIA data)at http://energy-models.com/downloads (you do have to sign up to download, but it is free and we keep your address private)
It takes quite a while to maintain these rates, and I am currently in the process of automating the process for eQUEST (which is more work). However, there hasn't been too much interest in the TRACE 700 rates, so I don't know if it is worth making all the eQUEST rates. There is a survey on the homepage - energy-models.com - if you wish to show your interest to get this process expedited.
EIA rates are good for a start, but I agree with Nick about using the actual rates, especially since LEED points are based on $ savings and not energy. The EIA rates are "Linear" with energy vs. costs. However, in many actual rates, saving 10% in energy (or demand) may correspond with say 20% cost savings. LEED was intended to work in such a way, so that in "the big picture" there is greater energy savings, ie, utility companies can run more efficiently. 
However, the average rates are a great place to start, no doubt, especially considering the complexity of many rate structures.
Anyway, if you are interested in eQUEST EIA values, please vote on the homepage at energy-models.com.
Thanks,
Bob

different mechanical systems will have on energy cost savings? It seems that
a lot of project teams during the design stages want to know the influence
on energy models and ultimately how big of a drop or gain in LEED points
certain system changes will have. Ironically, the current process of LEED is
analyzing the energy a building consumes based on systems that are already
designed.

We are just about to roll out our new software tool which does exactly this.
It's quick, web based, and it models energy as well as construction cost,
LEED, CO2 footprint, water, and long term financial performance.  Check us

Message-ID: <59E2E377E476B54DA9C436B79032B171011F4DF6@DAGHER-EXCH01.DAGHER.COM>

I have a questions about the modeling of Parking Garages for ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G energy model

As I was looking up the definition of a conditioned and semi-heated space in Section 3 of ASHRAE 90.1 I noticed that under the definition of an "unconditioned space" it states that "Crawlspaces, attics, and parking garages with natural or mechanical ventilation are not considered enclosed spaces." In addition the definition of "ventilation" is "the process of supplying or removing air by natural or mechanical means to or from any space. Such air is not required to have been conditioned." Since the air is not required to be conditioned then the air can or cannot be conditioned, does that mean that any parking garage conditioned or unconditioned is not considered an enclosed space? If that is true then how do you model a parking garage since all spaces are defined as being enclosed?

Message-ID: <FCEBC0C28321F7479789B25A13030F6902986B98@sandbinc2.sbi.smithboucher.com>

These definitions came up during review of one of my recent LEED
projects.  For future reference, 90.1 questions may be seen by a group
more keen to respond if you post to the [bldg-rate] list.

 

I've got a definite position if you'd like to hear:

 

1. As you point out, per the definition of "unconditioned space,"
parking garages are "...not considered enclosed spaces."  Whether in
design it's actually conditioned or not has no bearing on this
statement.

 

2. All of the definitions for space classifications, and indeed the
definition for "space," start with "an enclosed space..."  Therefore no
parking garage can be considered "conditioned" or "semiheated," or even
as a "space." 

 

3. This also means by extension (re: section 5.1.2): There are no
envelope requirements for parking garages, as they are not "spaces" of
any classification.

  

If you reject this approach and instead assert a parking garage can be a
"conditioned space," you'd be forced down a path of assigning identical
heating/cooling systems to parking garage spaces in both proposed and
baseline models, per Table G3.1.1.b, regardless of whether it's actually
conditioned or not.  Things might get hairy if you're only heating or
only cooling (I believe the other would need to match the baseline
serving the rest of the floor/building, as may apply).  I'd only suggest
that requiring heating/cooling of parking garages in all climates seems
odd for an energy efficiency standard - you'd have to explain that one
to me ;).

 

If you do have heating and/or cooling for a parking garage design, I'd
personally stick with points #1/#2 above and simply model such energies
as a process load alongside any mechanical ventilation systems,
identical in both models.  

 

I personally use eQuest, and prefer to model parking garages as simply
as a series of building shades with a series of process/lighting loads
attached directly to the meter.

 

All this is my take on the situation.  I think it's pretty defensible,
but there may have been CIR's I'm unaware of to the contrary - not that
precedent matters anymore...

 

Hope that helps you and others,

 

~Nick

I have a questions about the modeling of Parking Garages for ASHRAE 90.1
Appendix G energy model

 

As I was looking up the definition of a conditioned and semi-heated
space in Section 3 of ASHRAE 90.1 I noticed that under the definition of
an "unconditioned space" it states that "Crawlspaces, attics, and
parking garages with natural or mechanical ventilation are not
considered enclosed spaces." In addition the definition of "ventilation"
is "the process of supplying or removing air by natural or mechanical
means to or from any space. Such air is not required to have been
conditioned." Since the air is not required to be conditioned then the
air can or cannot be conditioned, does that mean that any parking garage
conditioned or unconditioned is not considered an enclosed space? If
that is true then how do you model a parking garage since all spaces are
defined as being enclosed?

While parking garages may not be considered "spaces" per ASHRAE, I think
lighting should still be modeled differently for baseline and proposed
per Appendix G, and not considered a process load. "Lighting power for
parking garages and building facades shall be modeled" per Table G3.1,
and baseline lighting is determined per Section 9.2, where values for
parking garage lighting power appear in both the Building Area and
Space-by-Space Tables. You could attach these (different) lighting loads
directly to a meter, as Nick suggests, if you don't model the parking
garage as a space in the model.

These definitions came up during review of one of my recent LEED
projects.  For future reference, 90.1 questions may be seen by a group
more keen to respond if you post to the [bldg-rate] list.
 
I've got a definite position if you'd like to hear:
 
1. As you point out, per the definition of "unconditioned space,"
parking garages are "...not considered enclosed spaces."  Whether in
design it's actually conditioned or not has no bearing on this
statement.
 
2. All of the definitions for space classifications, and indeed the
definition for "space," start with "an enclosed space..."  Therefore no
parking garage can be considered "conditioned" or "semiheated," or even
as a "space." 
 
3. This also means by extension (re: section 5.1.2): There are no
envelope requirements for parking garages, as they are not "spaces" of
any classification.
  
If you reject this approach and instead assert a parking garage can be a
"conditioned space," you'd be forced down a path of assigning identical
heating/cooling systems to parking garage spaces in both proposed and
baseline models, per Table G3.1.1.b, regardless of whether it's actually
conditioned or not.  Things might get hairy if you're only heating or
only cooling (I believe the other would need to match the baseline
serving the rest of the floor/building, as may apply).  I'd only suggest
that requiring heating/cooling of parking garages in all climates seems
odd for an energy efficiency standard - you'd have to explain that one
to me ;).
 
If you do have heating and/or cooling for a parking garage design, I'd
personally stick with points #1/#2 above and simply model such energies
as a process load alongside any mechanical ventilation systems,
identical in both models.  
 
I personally use eQuest, and prefer to model parking garages as simply
as a series of building shades with a series of process/lighting loads
attached directly to the meter.
 
All this is my take on the situation.  I think it's pretty defensible,
but there may have been CIR's I'm unaware of to the contrary - not that
precedent matters anymore...

for leed 2.2 & below i've typically use it in conjunction w/my 
narratives and other air device/design data.  by itself i find it useful 
in showing a range for some design conditions but ... a) it's old and 
hasn't been updated (as far as i know).  it is based on 55-1992.  i 
point this out in my narratives as the graphs it generates are based on 
met & clo & those haven't changed, b) it has an upper limit on graphs 
verses met in my experience.  if you're using a low met you probably 
won't see it but if your met is above 1.6 (i think) it defaults back 
down to 1.6 so i'm not sure it is reflective of higher met levels - like 
2 & 3 where you have exercise or heavy work areas.

for leed 3 i'm looking at using the software from the ashrae thermal 
comfort tools cd in conjunction w/air device selection software that can 
calculate adpi values (krueger's can do this) in addition to the 
standard narratives & air device/design data.

Thanks for the feedback Patrick. The Krueger visually modifies the psych
comfort box based on input criteria, whereas the ASHRAE tool appears to not
have the visual representation. Is this your experience? How would you
demonstrate your values fall within range with the ASHRAE tool, unless you
map the results on a psych chart, and validate with provided PPD output?

Thanks, Arpan

I would also add that, while lighting loads could be modeled differently
in the baseline and proposed models, ventilation fans should be modeled
identically.  One exception to that would be if proposed fan motors
exceed minimum motor efficiencies in Table 10.8.  Another possible
exception might be if ventilation fans were equipped with VFDs and
automatically controlled by carbon monoxide sensors, but you'd have to
prove your savings through an Exceptional Calculation Method.

You could attach these (different) lighting loads directly to a meter, as Nick suggests, if you don't model the parking garage as a space in the model.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1 - Appendix G - Parking Garages


These definitions came up during review of one of my recent LEED projects.  For future reference, 90.1 questions may be seen by a group more keen to respond if you post to the [bldg-rate] list.



I've got a definite position if you'd like to hear:



1. As you point out, per the definition of "unconditioned space," parking garages are "...not considered enclosed spaces."  Whether in design it's actually conditioned or not has no bearing on this statement.



2. All of the definitions for space classifications, and indeed the definition for "space," start with "an enclosed space..."  Therefore no parking garage can be considered "conditioned" or "semiheated," or even as a "space."



3. This also means by extension (re: section 5.1.2): There are no envelope requirements for parking garages, as they are not "spaces" of any classification.



If you reject this approach and instead assert a parking garage can be a "conditioned space," you'd be forced down a path of assigning identical heating/cooling systems to parking garage spaces in both proposed and baseline models, per Table G3.1.1.b, regardless of whether it's actually conditioned or not.  Things might get hairy if you're only heating or only cooling (I believe the other would need to match the baseline serving the rest of the floor/building, as may apply).  I'd only suggest that requiring heating/cooling of parking garages in all climates seems odd for an energy efficiency standard - you'd have to explain that one to me ;).



If you do have heating and/or cooling for a parking garage design, I'd personally stick with points #1/#2 above and simply model such energies as a process load alongside any mechanical ventilation systems, identical in both models.



I personally use eQuest, and prefer to model parking garages as simply as a series of building shades with a series of process/lighting loads attached directly to the meter.



All this is my take on the situation.  I think it's pretty defensible, but there may have been CIR's I'm unaware of to the contrary - not that precedent matters anymore...



Hope that helps you and others,



~Nick

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1 - Appendix G - Parking Garages



I have a questions about the modeling of Parking Garages for ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G energy model



As I was looking up the definition of a conditioned and semi-heated space in Section 3 of ASHRAE 90.1 I noticed that under the definition of an "unconditioned space" it states that "Crawlspaces, attics, and parking garages with natural or mechanical ventilation are not considered enclosed spaces." In addition the definition of "ventilation" is "the process of supplying or removing air by natural or mechanical means to or from any space. Such air is not required to have been conditioned." Since the air is not required to be conditioned then the air can or cannot be conditioned, does that mean that any parking garage conditioned or unconditioned is not considered an enclosed space? If that is true then how do you model a parking garage since all spaces are defined as being enclosed?

Upcoming  EFEN 2.0 will have the same capability and more. EFEN uses EnergyPlus simulation engine  and intelligent building generator. The main focus of EFEN  1.0 was on the fenestration systems and several other variables including construction and HVAC  systems were fixed for a particular building type. Only 6 building types were included in ver 1.0 while ver 2.0 included 16 building types.  For more details and downloading free 30 days evaluation copy please visit the following webpage:

 

http://designbuildersoftware.com/efen.php

 

EFEN 2.0 beta (with EnergyPlus 6.0)  will be available in early February, 2011.  For any questions or more information please send email to support at designbuildersoftware.com or call at 413 256 4647

The other day someone posted a question asking:

Is there a tool out there that allows you to quickly analyze the effect different mechanical systems will have on energy cost savings? It seems that a lot of project teams during the design stages want to know the influence on energy models and ultimately how big of a drop or gain in LEED points certain system changes will have. Ironically, the current process of LEED is analyzing the energy a building consumes based on systems that are already designed?

We are just about to roll out our new software tool which does exactly this.  It?s quick, web based, and it models energy as well as construction cost, LEED, CO2 footprint, water, and long term financial performance.  Check us out at www.cloudforestsoftware.com <http://www.cloudforestsoftware.com/> 

I?d love to get feedback from this group.  I?ve been frustrated with the same issues mentioned above for many years, which was part of the inspiration for this tool.  Feel free to email me directly at aide at cloudforestsoftware.com

Announcing a  great opportunity to get trained without leaving your seat by
attending 1-day DesignBuilder Software CFD Training Webinar on January 28,
2011 (10 am - 3pm EST). 

DesignBuilder CFD has been especially designed to provide data on airflow
and temperature distribution in and around buildings using the same methods
as the general purpose pure CFD packages, but at a fraction of the cost and
without the need for specialist knowledge. Using conventional CFD packages
for building airflow analysis can be a time consuming task requiring very
careful attention to setting up the correct geometry and boundary
conditions. Using CFD in DesignBuilder simplifies this process hugely by
automatically providing the geometry and boundary conditions. Temperatures,
heat flows and flow rates previously calculated by EnergyPlus can be
seamlessly used to provide boundary conditions simply by specifying the
time/date of the CFD analysis. 

For more details about DesignBuilder CFD:

http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/content/view/40/61/

The objective of this workshop is to  provide a general overview and
introduction to DesignBuilder CFD software for both internal and external
analysis. The trainees will learn to quickly setup a building model, create
assemblies, change the grid settings, import E+ calculated temperatures, air
velocities etc and assign boundary conditions, run CFD simulation and
analyze the results.

Comfort Gradients

Are there other tools out there which are specifically developed to perform
only comfort calculations, PMV, PPD, etc.?

My understanding of the comfort models in DesignBuilder, ApacheSim
other energy modeling engines is that they calculate comfort only at the
central node of each thermal zone.

Is anyone aware of tools which calculate a gradient of comfort within each
thermal zone?

I know hiring of good people in the building simulation field is a challenge. Since the ASHRAE Winter Meeting is in my backyard this year I will be bringing a number of students to Las Vegas next week. Students attending the ASU Masters program that I coordinate are graduating with considerable building simulation skills (includes an intense two semester course from Marlin Addison) as well as a very good understanding of HVAC, daylighting and LEED. If any of you would like to set-up interviews with any of them please let me know. I have both 1st year students that are looking for 3 month summer internships and 2nd year students who will be graduating in May that are looking for permanent positions.

Hi Arpan,

The CBE thermal comfort model can do this but may not be generally 
available.  http://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/research/briefs-thermmodel.htm

TRNSYS 17 with the detailed radiation model allows definition of 
multiple comfort points in one zone and calculation of local comfort at 
each point based on the operative temperature experienced at that 
point.  Air temperature gradients could be accounted for by defining a 
single radiation zone with multiple air zones.

Regards
Erik

For supplemental heating, major inputs are:


(1)    OA temperature below which supplemental heating is allowed

(2)    OA temperature below which the heat pump is turned off

The first is to be set at 40?F per Section G3.1.3.1 - Heat Pumps (Systems 2 and 4).

I do not seem to find anything on which value to set the second at. Is there any guidance over there?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Doe2 Loop Sizing
Message-ID: <646340.98430.qm@web111801.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hello,
??????????? I am trying to determine how equest/doe2 sizes loop design flow. I 
would assume that that the program looks at the max coil load and divide it by 
the loop deltaT to obtain the loop design flow and the capacity. However in my 
case the program is over?sizing the loop by more than two times. I have attached 
the PS-H report and it is evident that the peak load is only 2.7 MBTU. The SS-D 
report also confirms that the peak load is 2.7 MBTU. However the cooling 
capacity of the loop is 6.9 MBTU! The loop gets loaded to a max of 50%. I did 
not enter any values for loop/pump flow and let the program auto-size. The 
deltaT on the loop is set to 12 F with a supply temperature of 44 F.
?
I see a similar problem if I have primary only or a primary-secondary looping 
configuration. Also, I set the system sizing option to coincident. If the loop 
size ratio is set?to 0.3 run again, I do not get any significant increase in the 
unmet hours, proving that the loop can meet the system demand at 1/3rd the 
flow!.
?
The only place that hints us about how the loop is being sized is in the 
definition of LOOP-SIZE ?RATIO
?
?LOOP-SIZE-RATIO
The safety factor for loop sizing. (Note that safety factors could have already 
been specified within the secondary HVAC systems attached to this loop). This 
keyword is used only when SIZING-OPTION = SECONDARY-EQUIP; it is ignored for the 
PRIMARY-EQUIP sizing method. When primary equipment is to be auto-sized by the 
program, this keyword modifies the default capacity assigned. Note that this 
keyword affects only the auto-sizing of the primary equipment based on secondary 
loop loads. It has no effect on the design loop flow;? the loop flow is based on 
the sum of the coil flows or other loads attached to the loop. However, the 
design pump flow can be modified via keywords in the PUMP command.?
?
I am puzzled why it is not using the sum of coil loads to size the loop.
?
Thanks for your inputs.
?
Raj.

We received a LEED review comment regarding Warehouse ventilation to comply
with ASHRAE 62.1-2004.

 

Generally depending on the warehouse storage, MEP team recommends 5-8 Air
Changes per Hour by thumb rule for exhaust and air intake is assumed by
infiltration by windows, open doors etc.. But this number I haven't find in
ASHRAE, please give me reference.

 

ASHRAE 62.1-2004, Table 6-1 for warehouse category says to have 0.06
cfm/ft2, is this number defines to intake or Exhaust? If it is exhaust, it
is too small as volume of warehouse will be high.

 

Please share your ideas to comply with the requirements.

Ashraf,

 

ASHRAE 62.1 is concerned with people, who need ventilation (supply /
intake).  For typical buildings, you may not need separate exhaust fans,
because that amount can probably exfiltrate through cracks.  Supply and
exhaust fans can be used in tandem if the building is fairly tight (no
leaks).

 

Your MEP team's  5-8 air changes per hour is for cooling, not ventilation.
Any building with which has that much infiltration is closer to a tent than
a building! (It's not closed up.)

Hello James,

 

I accept that ASHRAE 62.1 is concerned with people, the same we explained to
LEED Reviewer team, this is the comment we received, 

 

However, since the project uses ventilator fans it is considered a
mechanically ventilated space. Additionally, the LEED-NC v2.2 IEQp1 CIR
ruling dated 10/8/2008 states that unless the mechanically ventilated
warehouse has no human occupancy except for maintenance and repairs it must
meet the requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2004. The narrative states
that the warehouse will be occupied for the loading and unloading of goods;
therefore, the warehouse is regularly occupied. 

Provide calculations for the warehouse space demonstrating that the space
complies with the minimum requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2004.

 

I am not having any idea how to convince the team.

 

Thanks & Regards,

Ashraf

Sounds impossible.

 

Information in bulk zone modelling is only stored at the node (typically
centre of zone) and on surfaces with no additional info in between. 

 

There are too many unknown parameters to determine thermal comfort in
this way to determine a gradient. 

 

You would have to use CFD which can be tricky without experience of
solar radiation modelling (depending on package used).

My understanding of the comfort models in DesignBuilder, ApacheSim other

Is anyone aware of tools which calculate a gradient of comfort within

Ashraf,

 

It seems that all you need to do is demonstrate that your ventilation system
complies with Table 6-1.  Are you introducing at least .06 cfm/sq.ft of
outdoor air with the mechanical ventilation system?

 

If so, just document it!  If not, you're in trouble and will need to provide
a ventilation system.

therefore, the warehouse is regularly occupied. 

Provide calculations for the warehouse space demonstrating that the space
complies with the minimum requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2004.

 

I am not having any idea how to convince the team.

Ashraf,

 

ASHRAE 62.1 is concerned with people, who need ventilation (supply /
intake).  For typical buildings, you may not need separate exhaust fans,
because that amount can probably exfiltrate through cracks.  Supply and
exhaust fans can be used in tandem if the building is fairly tight (no
leaks).

 

Your MEP team's  5-8 air changes per hour is for cooling, not ventilation.
Any building with which has that much infiltration is closer to a tent than
a building! (It's not closed up.)

We received a LEED review comment regarding Warehouse ventilation to comply
with ASHRAE 62.1-2004.

 

Generally depending on the warehouse storage, MEP team recommends 5-8 Air
Changes per Hour by thumb rule for exhaust and air intake is assumed by
infiltration by windows, open doors etc.. But this number I haven't find in
ASHRAE, please give me reference.

 

ASHRAE 62.1-2004, Table 6-1 for warehouse category says to have 0.06
cfm/ft2, is this number defines to intake or Exhaust? If it is exhaust, it
is too small as volume of warehouse will be high.

 

Please share your ideas to comply with the requirements.

 

Thanks & Regards,

Ashraf

Sounds impossible.
 
Information in bulk zone modelling is only stored at the node (typically centre 
of zone) and on surfaces with no additional info in between. 

 
There are too many unknown parameters to determine thermal comfort in this way 
to determine a gradient. 

 
You would have to use CFD which can be tricky without experience of solar 
radiation modelling (depending on package used).

pretty much so if you're attempting to use to the ashrae comfort tools 
to invidually "model" every space in a building.  i am using it at the 
system level only, more as a measure of setpoint/airflow to show a 
compliance with ashrae 55 as the systems i typically work with are 
simpler (i.e. smaller packaged units with not a lot of differentiation 
in use met/clo per system).

the ashrae tool has its limitations but your question was about tools 
that are specifically developed to perform only comfort calculations - 
pmv, ppd, etc, - and that it does within the limitations of how it is 
applied and what one is trying to use it for.

James,

 

If we introduce 0.06 cfm.sqft, of outdoor air, if it complies with ASHRAE
requirements, then we can do that.  Normally all warehouses here will be
having ventilators to exhaust air which is assumed that air intake by
infiltration.

 

Also project is located in DUBAI, UAE. Climate here is very hot and humid;
if I introduce outdoor air it will affect the storage materials in the
warehouse. 

 

Did you know where can I find the exhaust rates, such as Toilets, Generator
Room, pump room in ASHRAE?

 

Thanks & Regards,

Ashraf

Ashraf,

 

It seems that all you need to do is demonstrate that your ventilation system
complies with Table 6-1.  Are you introducing at least .06 cfm/sq.ft of
outdoor air with the mechanical ventilation system?

 

If so, just document it!  If not, you're in trouble and will need to provide
a ventilation system.

Hello James,

 

I accept that ASHRAE 62.1 is concerned with people, the same we explained to

However, since the project uses ventilator fans it is considered a
mechanically ventilated space. Additionally, the LEED-NC v2.2 IEQp1 CIR

warehouse has no human occupancy except for maintenance and repairs it must

?Toilet room minimum exhaust rates are shown in Table 6-4 or Standard 62.1-2004 (sub-notes D and E.)

A side note:  Eight (8) air changes per hour translates to 2.67 cfm/sq.ft. if we a assume ceiling height of 20 ft.  This definitely sounds like a recommendation for cooling and not just ventilation.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest HVAC Loads
Message-ID: <DBF24AF60BDE5947889EA17A54BDCFA83C2AD03797@exch07mail1>

Hi,

I'm using eQuest to develop heat pump loads for a geothermal system retrofit an existing apartment building constructed in the 1940s. I'm using hourly reports to generate the space heating and cooling loads, and I want to verify that I'm using the correct variables.

Currently I'm using the "BUILDING-HVAC" report block. I'm using variables 1 & 2 - "Building cool load (coils+losses&gains)" and "Building heat load (coils+losses&gains)". Are these the right variables to use if I want to generate an hourly space heating and cooling load profile for the primary equipment (in this case, a water-to-water heat pump?)

Thanks,

Apologies for cross-posting


 

IBPSA-USA and IBPSA-Canada invite you to join a two-day workshop on model
predictive control (MPC) in buildings June 24-25, 2011 in Montreal, Canada
that will serve as a forum for lively dialogue on different approaches,
applications, and field experiences. The event will feature a series of
technical presentations, selected by a Scientific Committee of
internationally recognized domain experts, as well as time for networking
and exchange. It will close with a roundtable discussion to define future
research needs and highlight opportunities for collaboration and business
applications. The Scientific Committee will then invite 5 to 7 presenters to
submit manuscripts to be published in a 2012 Special Issue of the Journal of
Building Performance Simulation (JBPS) on "MPC in Buildings." Please see the
attached call for presentation proposals. Proposals and inquiries can be
directed to MPCworkshop at gmail.com. Presentation proposals are due March 15,
2011.

Dear Ashraf,

 

Think about it.  If you exhaust X cfm, where does the infiltration come
from?  Outdoors!  So you are already introducing hot humid Dubai air into
the building.  A (supply)  ventilation system does the same thing as an
exhaust-with-infiltration system; it pushes instead of pulls.  As long as
the fans actually move the same amount of air, the end result is similar.
(The actual mixing within the space is generally better, though, for a
supply system.)   

 

ASHRAE 62 is not confident that the infiltration actually occurs (the
building can be constructed very tightly), so they generally want you to
have a supply system .  As I think about it, I don't think they require an
exhaust fan, but id the air is introduced, there must be adequate leaks,
louvers or exhaust capacity to let it out.  

 

0.06 cfm / sq.ft. is not much.  For a 30ft tall warehouse. 0.5 cfm/sq.ft.
results in 1 AC/hr., so 0.06 cfm/sq.ft.  is around .12 AC/hr (if the
building is 30 feet tall).  This amount of air certainly won't affect your
indoor environment noticeably if your exhaust system is 5-8 air changes! 

 

It's possible that LEED will buy an explanation which discusses why you can
be confident that the exhaust fans are providing good ventilation because:

.         They are properly spaced around the floor area

.         Operate continuously whenever people are present

.         Move the correct amount of air because there are louvers or other
means to make sure the air can get into the building

 

Good luck!  It sounds as though you really have good ventilation, but need
to make LEED confident about how you are doing it.

James,

 

If we introduce 0.06 cfm.sqft, of outdoor air, if it complies with ASHRAE
requirements, then we can do that.  Normally all warehouses here will be
having ventilators to exhaust air which is assumed that air intake by
infiltration.

 

Also project is located in DUBAI, UAE. Climate here is very hot and humid;
if I introduce outdoor air it will affect the storage materials in the
warehouse. 

 

Did you know where can I find the exhaust rates, such as Toilets, Generator
Room, pump room in ASHRAE?

 

Thanks & Regards,

Ashraf

Ashraf,

 

It seems that all you need to do is demonstrate that your ventilation system
complies with Table 6-1.  Are you introducing at least .06 cfm/sq.ft of
outdoor air with the mechanical ventilation system?

 

If so, just document it!  If not, you're in trouble and will need to provide
a ventilation system.

Hello James,

 

I accept that ASHRAE 62.1 is concerned with people, the same we explained to
LEED Reviewer team, this is the comment we received, 

 

However, since the project uses ventilator fans it is considered a
mechanically ventilated space. Additionally, the LEED-NC v2.2 IEQp1 CIR
ruling dated 10/8/2008 states that unless the mechanically ventilated
warehouse has no human occupancy except for maintenance and repairs it must
meet the requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2004. The narrative states
that the warehouse will be occupied for the loading and unloading of goods;
therefore, the warehouse is regularly occupied. 

Provide calculations for the warehouse space demonstrating that the space
complies with the minimum requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2004.

 

I am not having any idea how to convince the team.

 

Thanks & Regards,

Ashraf

Ashraf,

 

ASHRAE 62.1 is concerned with people, who need ventilation (supply /
intake).  For typical buildings, you may not need separate exhaust fans,
because that amount can probably exfiltrate through cracks.  Supply and
exhaust fans can be used in tandem if the building is fairly tight (no
leaks).

 

Your MEP team's  5-8 air changes per hour is for cooling, not ventilation.
Any building with which has that much infiltration is closer to a tent than
a building! (It's not closed up.)

We received a LEED review comment regarding Warehouse ventilation to comply
with ASHRAE 62.1-2004.

 

Generally depending on the warehouse storage, MEP team recommends 5-8 Air
Changes per Hour by thumb rule for exhaust and air intake is assumed by
infiltration by windows, open doors etc.. But this number I haven't find in
ASHRAE, please give me reference.

 

ASHRAE 62.1-2004, Table 6-1 for warehouse category says to have 0.06
cfm/ft2, is this number defines to intake or Exhaust? If it is exhaust, it
is too small as volume of warehouse will be high.

 

Please share your ideas to comply with the requirements.

Message-ID: <4D404BC5.1090003@gmail.com>

Hello,

/Virtual partition: a transparent partition with no mass and no thermal 
resistance.  If the simulation employs an air flow network it may also 
be considered as a hole allowing air to pass through the partition. 
Usually used to define a perimeter zone. (BTW this isn't quoting any 
source, just what I understand!)/

I feel I may be describing a cultural nuance of energy modelling in the 
UK. So I'd like to ask the following:

    * Do engineers in countries apart from the UK use "virtual partitions"?
    * What benefits do virtual partitions have over physical partitions?

Any other comments will be gratefully received.

Many thanks

Hi Arpan,

What you described here is in the area of CFD simulation. You could not
expect an energy modeling engine provide you such data. Except for
ApacheSim, IES VE has a CFD module, MicroFlo, which can fulfill your
requirements easily.

Hello Chris,

It is not a cultural nuance and I use virtual partitions almost everyday.

Why? I have to employ it when

1. I need to setup different internal loads for a space with multi-zone,
such as big open office (you mentioned it in your own definition);
2. I need to simulate displacement ventilation in a space (I will put the
virtual partitions horizontally though to separate occupied and stratified
spaces)
3. I need to define stack effect in some spaces
4. Some other reasons...

Hello,

Virtual partition: a transparent partition with no mass and no thermal resistance.  If the simulation employs an air flow network it may also be considered as a hole allowing air to pass through the partition. Usually used to define a perimeter zone. (BTW this isn't quoting any source, just what I understand!)

I feel I may be describing a cultural nuance of energy modelling in the UK. So I'd like to ask the following:

 *   Do engineers in countries apart from the UK use "virtual partitions"?
I use them all the time, especially when defining a large space (such as an open office or a gymnasium). I divide the zone into perimeter (~15 feet or approx. 5 m beyond external wall) and core zone. There is no actual partition but only a virtual partition which I have created. The reason for this division is that the perimeter zones experience external loads as well as internal loads, whereas the core zones experience only the internal loads.

 *   What benefits do virtual partitions have over physical partitions?
The virtual partitions allow for heat transfer through convection between the perimeter and the adjacent core zone. If it is defined as an internal partition, then the heat transfer will be through conduction which is not true for the actual space as there is no actual partition. Additionally, if the internal partition is defined with thermal mass, it can add some thermal lag as well and the zone then might peak at a different time than it would without the lag.
Any other comments will be gratefully received.

Many thanks

Hi Arpan,

You may have already known that the results, including surface temperatures,
from ApacheSim will be introduced as boundary condition into Microflo.
However, you can define the boundary condition yourself without referring
back to the ApacheSim calculation. I usually respect results from field
measurement more than those from simulation (My personal feeling is that the
simulation results usually are conservative in terms of estimating surface
temperatures). Using my recent simulation as an example, I increase my
boundary surface temperature from 20+ degree C (results from ApacheSim) to
40+ degree C (results from field measurement) and achieve more realistic
thermal comfort numbers.

So, back to your question, my premature thought is that, the method of
calculating MRT is not that critical compared as boundary condition which
will have significant impact on MRT. As long as a properly defined boundary
condition can be provided, MRT will be on the righ track.

Regards,

Cheney

The requirements of ASHRAE 62.1-2004 and 2007 are setup in both a
per-person rate to account for respiration-induced IAQ contaminants as
well as per-area rate to account for room contents (furniture,
materials, etc) induced IAQ contaminants.  The warehouse only has to
cover the per-area rate since it is assumed to be non-regularly occupied
or have such a low occupant density that it does not impact the overall
need for outdoor air.  I'm not certain what the reviewer's specific
comments were, but my guess is they did not see what they were expecting
to see for ventilation.  They will not generally comment if the
ventilation rate exceeds ASHRAE requirements by a large amount, however.

 

There may be other reasons to have a high ACH for warehouses: the
materials stored, etc.  5-8 ACH is excessively high for cooling needs
also and you'd probably be better off air conditioning at that point
(haven't analyzed it specifically, but fan power consumption is related
to volume in a cubic function, meaning each 10% increase in supply
volume requires 33% more power.  Warehouses typically have either a
positive pressure design or a negative pressure design - yours using
exhaust fans is a negative pressure design.  For Dubai, a positive
pressure design using supply fans with exhaust louvers (instead of the
opposite) would likely make more sense: less energy to keep the warm air
out than to cool it down once it gets in.

 

Since the project is in Dubai, don't forget the mandatory Chapter 4
rules in ASHRAE 62.1 on outdoor air cleaning.  If the outdoor air does
not pass the U.S. EPA air quality standards, then outdoor air quality
must be addressed on any outdoor air used for ventilation purposes.
Particulate will likely be a significant problem.  This does tie in to
other LEED credits, particularly EQ Credit 5 (LEED-NC and LEED-CS
projects) which requires MERV 13 filters on all outdoor air intakes.

 

You may want to take a step back from the review comments and
re-evaluate design intent for the warehouse.  Asking questions like
"what will be stored in the warehouse?" and "how often will it be
accessed for inbound/outbound shipping and putaway?" will help you
figure out what the space needs for ventilation and temperature control.
Then, you can factor in the ASHRAE requirements and bump up the areas
where your design intent does not reach the levels necessary.  Good luck
on the review!

Dear Ashraf,

 

Think about it.  If you exhaust X cfm, where does the infiltration come
from?  Outdoors!  So you are already introducing hot humid Dubai air
into the building.  A (supply)  ventilation system does the same thing
as an exhaust-with-infiltration system; it pushes instead of pulls.  As
long as the fans actually move the same amount of air, the end result is
similar.  (The actual mixing within the space is generally better,
though, for a supply system.)   

 

ASHRAE 62 is not confident that the infiltration actually occurs (the
building can be constructed very tightly), so they generally want you to
have a supply system .  As I think about it, I don't think they require
an exhaust fan, but id the air is introduced, there must be adequate
leaks, louvers or exhaust capacity to let it out.  

 

0.06 cfm / sq.ft. is not much.  For a 30ft tall warehouse. 0.5
cfm/sq.ft. results in 1 AC/hr., so 0.06 cfm/sq.ft.  is around .12 AC/hr
(if the building is 30 feet tall).  This amount of air certainly won't
affect your indoor environment noticeably if your exhaust system is 5-8
air changes! 

 

It's possible that LEED will buy an explanation which discusses why you
can be confident that the exhaust fans are providing good ventilation
because:

*         They are properly spaced around the floor area

*         Operate continuously whenever people are present

*         Move the correct amount of air because there are louvers or
other means to make sure the air can get into the building

 

Good luck!  It sounds as though you really have good ventilation, but
need to make LEED confident about how you are doing it.

James,

 

If we introduce 0.06 cfm.sqft, of outdoor air, if it complies with
ASHRAE requirements, then we can do that.  Normally all warehouses here
will be having ventilators to exhaust air which is assumed that air
intake by infiltration.

 

Also project is located in DUBAI, UAE. Climate here is very hot and
humid; if I introduce outdoor air it will affect the storage materials
in the warehouse. 

 

Did you know where can I find the exhaust rates, such as Toilets,
Generator Room, pump room in ASHRAE?

 

Thanks & Regards,

Ashraf

Ashraf,

 

It seems that all you need to do is demonstrate that your ventilation
system complies with Table 6-1.  Are you introducing at least .06
cfm/sq.ft of outdoor air with the mechanical ventilation system?

 

If so, just document it!  If not, you're in trouble and will need to
provide a ventilation system.

Hello James,

 

I accept that ASHRAE 62.1 is concerned with people, the same we
explained to LEED Reviewer team, this is the comment we received, 

 

However, since the project uses ventilator fans it is considered a
mechanically ventilated space. Additionally, the LEED-NC v2.2 IEQp1 CIR
ruling dated 10/8/2008 states that unless the mechanically ventilated
warehouse has no human occupancy except for maintenance and repairs it
must meet the requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2004. The narrative
states that the warehouse will be occupied for the loading and unloading
of goods; therefore, the warehouse is regularly occupied. 

Provide calculations for the warehouse space demonstrating that the
space complies with the minimum requirements of ASHRAE Standard
62.1-2004.

 

I am not having any idea how to convince the team.

 

Thanks & Regards,

Ashraf

Ashraf,

 

ASHRAE 62.1 is concerned with people, who need ventilation (supply /
intake).  For typical buildings, you may not need separate exhaust fans,
because that amount can probably exfiltrate through cracks.  Supply and
exhaust fans can be used in tandem if the building is fairly tight (no
leaks).

 

Your MEP team's  5-8 air changes per hour is for cooling, not
ventilation.  Any building with which has that much infiltration is
closer to a tent than a building! (It's not closed up.)

comply with ASHRAE 62.1-2004.

 

Generally depending on the warehouse storage, MEP team recommends 5-8
Air Changes per Hour by thumb rule for exhaust and air intake is assumed
by infiltration by windows, open doors etc.. But this number I haven't
find in ASHRAE, please give me reference.

 

ASHRAE 62.1-2004, Table 6-1 for warehouse category says to have 0.06

it is too small as volume of warehouse will be high.

 

Please share your ideas to comply with the requirements.

Are there other tools out there which are specifically developed to perform

My understanding of the comfort models in DesignBuilder, ApacheSim other

Is anyone aware of tools which calculate a gradient of comfort within each

Dear Curtis, Gaurav and Cheney

I cannot profess to understand radiation exchange in the depth I really 
should. I do however have some experience of energyplus and one thing I 
wouldn't want to attempt in it is Virtual partitions. Under most 
circumstances its gradient based or node based displacement vent models 
are probably superior to the "stacked" volumes approach.

I'm still unconvinced regarding the need for virtual partitions to 
denote perimeter zones for the following reasons:

    * The 15ft perimeter in LEED appears to be relating to speculative
      office space that could be subject to fit-out. A fit-out would be
      undertaken with solid partitions. Therefore, why not model with
      solid partitions?
    * If, on the other hand, the perimeter zone requirement relates to
      varying access to daylight, modelling of daylight sensors may
      better serve this purpose.
    * The virtual partition seems to be a rather artificial boundary
      possibly subject to an expensive computational overhead and
      convergence issues.

Finally, I feel these points must also be weighed against the designers 
judgement as to whether Air temperature (or Space conditioning based on 
Air temperature) will vary significantly across the floor plate.

Best regards

Chris

Hi Jeremy,

In the Gulf region, sand trap louvres are being used at intake side. The sand trap louvre is designed to separate large particles at low air
velocities,minimizing excessive dust loading of conventional
filters.Think of it as a pre-filter for AHU.

The warehouse only has to cover the per-area rate since it is assumed to be non-regularly occupied or have such a low occupant density that it does not impact the overall need for outdoor air.? I?m not certain what the reviewer?s specific comments were, but my guess is they did not see what they were expecting to see for ventilation.? They will not generally comment if the ventilation rate exceeds ASHRAE requirements by a large amount, however. ?There may be other reasons to have a high ACH for warehouses: the materials stored, etc.? 5-8 ACH is excessively high for cooling needs also and you?d probably be better off air conditioning at that point (haven?t analyzed it specifically, but fan power
 consumption is related to volume in a cubic function, meaning each 10% increase in supply volume requires 33% more power.? Warehouses typically have either a positive pressure design or a negative pressure design ? yours using exhaust fans is a negative pressure design.? For Dubai, a positive pressure design using supply fans with exhaust louvers (instead of the opposite) would likely make more sense: less energy to keep the warm air out than to cool it down once it gets in. ?Since the project is in Dubai, don?t forget the mandatory Chapter 4 rules in ASHRAE 62.1 on outdoor air cleaning.? If the outdoor air does not pass the U.S. EPA air quality standards, then outdoor air quality must be addressed on any outdoor air used for ventilation purposes.? Particulate will likely be a significant problem.? This does tie in to other LEED credits, particularly EQ Credit 5 (LEED-NC and LEED-CS projects) which requires MERV 13 filters on all outdoor air
 intakes. ?You may want to take a step back from the review comments and re-evaluate design intent for the warehouse.? Asking questions like ?what will be stored in the warehouse?? and ?how often will it be accessed for inbound/outbound shipping and putaway?? will help you figure out what the space needs for ventilation and temperature control.? Then, you can factor in the ASHRAE requirements and bump up the areas where your design intent does not reach the levels necessary.? Good luck on the review! ?Jeremy R. Poling, PE, LEED AP+BDC

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Warehouse ventilations to comply with ASHRAE 62.1 ?Dear Ashraf, ?Think about it.? If you exhaust X cfm, where does the infiltration come from?? Outdoors!? So you are already introducing hot humid Dubai air into the building.? A (supply) ?ventilation system does the same thing as an exhaust-with-infiltration system; it pushes instead of pulls.? As long as the fans actually move the same amount of air, the end result is similar.? (The actual mixing within the space is generally better, though, for a supply system.) ?? ?ASHRAE 62 is not confident that the infiltration actually occurs (the building can be constructed very tightly), so they generally want you to have a supply system .? As I think about it, I don?t think they require an exhaust fan, but id the air is introduced, there must be adequate leaks, louvers or exhaust capacity to let it out.?  ?0.06 cfm / sq.ft. is not much.? For a 30ft tall warehouse. 0.5
 cfm/sq.ft. results in 1 AC/hr., so 0.06 cfm/sq.ft. ?is around .12 AC/hr (if the building is 30 feet tall).? This amount of air certainly won?t affect your indoor environment noticeably if your exhaust system is 5-8 air changes!  ?It?s possible that LEED will buy an explanation which discusses why you can be confident that the exhaust fans are providing good ventilation because:????????? They are properly spaced around the floor area????????? Operate continuously whenever people are present????????? Move the correct amount of air because there are louvers or other means to make sure the air can get into the building ?Good luck!? It sounds as though you really have good ventilation, but need to make LEED confident about how you are doing it. ?The Building Performance Team

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Is there a point to "virtual partitions"?

Hi Chris and Curtis,

An interesting topic...

Curtis, please advice. The virtual partition, to my understanding, is
actually No partition. If there is no partition, why color or spectrum
characteristics will take effect? I am not so familiar with Energy Plus, but
does it have two types of "virtual partition", one is IR transparent and one
is not? I also did a quick test in IES VE which can calculate long wave
radiant exchange. The way to define virtual partition in IES VE is simply to
cut a 100% hole on a solid partition. I tested one room with a window first
and the same room divided into 3 equivalent spaces by virtual partitions. It
shows the results obtained from the two models are quite similar. It accords
with your test by Energy Plus.

Chris, I agree with you that virtual partition is not a 'must' to the
perimeter zone. However, in some projects, it is certainly a simplification:
without putting up daylight sensor and conducting extra lighting
calculation, you can input LPD obtained from lighting designer directly; Or
sometimes mechanical designer has specific design in perimeter area
and virtual partition method can easily accommodate it without modifying the
whole room...etc...etc...

Regards,
Cheney

Hi Cheney,

I'm interested in your results for these equivalent models. Have you 
tried a sensitivity test with respect to time step? I'm wondering how 
much more closely the air temperature will match between the 3 "virtual 
zones" at shorter time steps.

If you can, log down the mean radiant temperatures as well. My hunch is 
that mean radiant will show more divergence than air temperature.

Cheers

Chris

Hi Chris,

I did not pay attention to the air temperatures in the three equivalent
zone. The original purpose was to test whether those "virtual partition" is
IR transparent. If they were, the overall sensible cooling/heating capacity
would be affected.

Then I looked into those temperatures after reading your email. Basically ,
the temperatures are represented in a 'beautiful' stratified manner. MRTs
are in the same manner, and divergence wise, no significant difference
compared as air temperatures.

I do not expect a simulation engine can trace the complication of the
physical state. The assumption behind the simulation engine is that, air
within the space is well stirred and represented by a single air
temperature. In order to see the stratified effect in some big space or
displacement ventilation effect, we refine the single space and come up with
more sub-space by "virtual partition". Air within each of the sub-zone is
well stirred but they are interacting with each other through the
boundaries, virtual partition.

>From research point of view, simulation is not a convincing tool at all,
even the most robust CFD simulation. I'd rather set up experiment and filed
measurement to explore specific physical state. Project wise, I believe the
assumption is fairly acceptable. Bear in mind, there are many other
assumptions which are rougher than this one but still survive.

Cheney

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Version 3 Unmet hours
Message-ID: <81CD81BB0AC1FF41B8F014BA7512A740096FEFFC@00mail.ad.fhai.org>

I am working on my first EA Prerequisite 2 and EA Credit 1 in Version 3.
When filling in the unmet hours for the proposed (67) and the baseline
(194), Table 1 shows that it is not compliant. I am worried that if I
ignore this, the credit will not be marked as complying with Minimum
Energy Performance requirements at the bottom of the template.

 

Has anyone ran in to this problem and what did they do? Did LEED
over-rule ASHRAE 90.1 2007 and force the unmet hours to be within 50 of
each other even if the proposed is lower than the baseline?

 

I am going to reduce the unmet hours in the baseline to within 50 of the
proposed to comply with the template but I believe this is the wrong.

 

Thanks for your input,

 

Otto

Virtually all Building Codes (which trump ASHRAE Standards) require ALL new
work and alterations to existing buildings to meet the current codes,
including energy codes.  Some jurisdictions allow replacement equipment to
have lower efficiencies than for new work.  So the answer to your question
is a definite "maybe".

 

Probably your best approach is to search online for the MN building codes to
see if it is one of those jurisdictions that differentiate between
replacement and new equipment.  Many jurisdictions post their codes, or at
least the revisions to the model codes online.

 

Best of luck.

Hi Otto -

I see from the bottom right of the page in your attachment that your credit
form is not the latest version...you have version 0.2.3, and the latest
version is v3.0 for LEED NC EAp2. There were lots of issues with the
original versions of many of the LEED v3 forms, so I recommend that you
update your credit form to avoid these problems...it will save you lots of
headaches. I believe the unmet hour issue has been corrected in the newer
form. To get the newest form, first make sure you save a copy of your
current form so you don't lose any information you've already entered, and
then click the "feedback" button in LEED online and request a form upgrade
for EAp2 (and EAc1, while you're at it).

Also, be sure to use the provided excel spreadsheet to enter all your
Baseline vs. Design case data rather than entering it in the form (EAp2
Section 1.4 tables.xls). This is found under the "Credit Resources" link on
the EAp2 credit information page in your LEED online project. Since you have
the old version of the form, it might not be clear that you are supposed to
use the spreadsheet.

Hope this helps, and good luck wading through the new version for the first
time!

Hi Dr. Varkie!

 

Your question hinges directly on which energy code/standard is being
enforced.

 

While someone on these lists might know definitively...  this is a
question that is probably best answered by the local planning department
that issues permits.  I would advise calling, ask what energy
standard/code (if any) is adopted and whether review of that
code/standard is part of the permit review process (energy codes in some
areas are adopted, but not enforced).  You may be able to speak directly
to the person who performs these reviews and if so she/he may be able to
give you a direct answer to your specific question of scope.

 

~Nick

Thanks for all the replies.  I should have done my homework before asking the question.  ASHRAE Std90 is clear on this topic but with the Minnesota Energy Code you have interpret ?remodeled elements? to include everything besides the structure
 
Minnesota Energy Code Chapter 7676 ? All Buildings except low-rise residential
Application: 
2. New & remodeled elements of buildings.  This Chapter applies to all new and remodeled elements of commercial and all other buildings. 
3. Existing Buildings.  Additions, alterations and repairs to existing buildings or structures must comply with part 7676.1400.
 
ASHRAE Std90-2004
4.1.1.5 Changes in Space Conditioning.  Whenever unconditioned and semi-heated spaces are converted to conditioned spaces, such conditioned spaces shall be brought into compliance with all the applicable requirements of this standard that would apply to the building envelope, heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, service water heating, power, lighting, and other systems and equipment of the space as if the building were new.
 
I would like to have your views and opinions on Articles 1 and 2 (open website http://bepan.info  click on tab Articles at the top and then the articles to open the file.
 Article-1 Architectural Design and the Perimeter Zone.  
Article-2 Mechanical Design and Percent Energy Savings
The website contains the teaching notes and examples of building energy use that I used for graduate courses and advising doctoral candidates.  I put them on a website, before throwing it all away, in case it might useful to others.  The objectives are in the Introduction.

Hi All,

G3.1.2.1 in ASHRAE 90.1 says that "Where efficiency ratings, such as EER and
COP, include fan energy, the descriptor shall be broken down into its
components so that supply fan energy can be modeled separately."

However, I am a little unclear as to which baseline systems this applies to.
 It seems that it would apply to systems 1 - 2, and not to systems 3 - 8?

Thanks,

likely to be achieved using equipment using R-410a.

I have the equations, but I haven't run through them yet.

Shooting from the hip, is it impossible, unlikely, 50/50, very likely, or a

I've always found that you have a tougher time achieving this credit with smaller units, since they have more refrigerant per ton. But it is not out of the question...you really have to run the calcs to be sure.

If you have a chiller system, or large packaged RTUs, much easier time, although you still need to make sure the manufacturer's rep doesn't oversize the refrigerant coil to achieve the highest efficiency (and bump you over the allowed 100 refrigerant impact per ton).

Hi Karen,

My understanding is that the statement will apply beyond system 1-2.
Whenever a HVAC system is defined in EER, it is necessary to separate supply
fan energy from cooling energy.

Supply fan energy = (gross cooling - net cooling)/3.413

and

COP = gross cooling /[(total input power - fan power) x 3.413]

Does it make sense?

Cheney

Hi Eurek,

The answer to your question is VERY LIKELY.

Why?

* Since R-410a will have 0 ODP and relatively small GWP (1890). Eventually
the equation is decided by only LCGWP, since LCODPx10^5 will be 0.
* My personal feeling is that Rc (Refrigerant charge) is critical in your
case. The range is from 0.5 to 5 lbs of refrigerant per ton. The smaller the
better.
* Considering multi types of equipments, as long as your averaged LCGWP is
less than 100, you will be safe.

As suggested by James, you will have to run the calculation to be sure.

My experience has been the same as James - the smaller units typically
have more of a problem, particularly RTUs less than 10 tons.  The
refrigerant charge is high compared to the maximum allowable to get a
total Refrigerant Impact per Ton <100.

 

Also, I just ran into this on a project as well - there are
"supercharged" chillers on the market that also have high charge-per-ton
numbers.

 

See Page 210 of the LEED-BDC reference guide for a table showing the
maximum refrigerant charges for typical refrigerants.  For RTUs, 15-year
life, you have to be less than 1.98 lbs/ton and the last I remember only
Trane had a unit at that low of a charge and still met ASHRAE 90.1
minimum efficiencies.

Agree with all the previous comments; I'll also point out that split systems can be tough if there are long line-sets.

Karen,
>From the user's guide, the fan power should be removed from the standard EER rating of packaged cooling systems. Excerpt below but let me know if you have any further questions.

A 15-ton packaged rooftop single-zone system having an EER of 8.6 (COP of 2.5) is
specified for a building. The following table gives the design specifications. How should
this be modeled?
Equipment parameter                               Value
Net Cooling Capacity (Btu/h)                   174,000
Total Packaged Unit Input Power (W)        20,128
EER                                                         8.64
Gross Cooling Cap (ARI conditions)         182,000
A
The supply fan power is the difference between the gross and the net cooling capacity.
Supply Fan Power  = (182,000 - 174,000 Btu / h) / 3.413 Btu /W h =  2343 W

>From the equation for cooling system COP, the cooling provided by the compressor and
the condenser into the airstream in Btu/h per Btu/h of electrical power input is:
COP  = (182,000 Btu / h) / {(20,128 - 2343 W)* 3.413 Btu / W h } = 3.0
Some simulation programs use an energy input ratio (EIR), which is 1/COP. In this case,
the EIR for this piece of equipment would be 1/3 or 0.333.

G3.1.2.1 in ASHRAE 90.1 says that "Where efficiency ratings, such as EER and COP, include fan energy, the descriptor shall be broken down into its components so that supply fan energy can be modeled separately."

However, I am a little unclear as to which baseline systems this applies to.  It seems that it would apply to systems 1 - 2, and not to systems 3 - 8?

Thanks,

Hi Sam,

I guess my question is the definition of "packaged" for the baseline system
case.  Systems 1 and 2 are very clearly packaged systems, with relatively
low fan power.  The fan power calculation reflects this, with much lower fan
powers for these systems.  However, systems 5 and 6 are called "packaged"
systems, but these systems typically serve a large portion of a building
with more extensive ductwork and higher fan powers (reflected in the fan
power calculation), subtracting out fan powers from these systems and
manipulating the EER of these systems results in very high EERs (upwards of
18???).

It is unclear to me which air conditioners listed in section 6.8 have a
rating which includes fan power and which do not.  I am assuming that where
different "single package" and "split system" EERs are given, that the first
includes fan energy while the second does not.

Anyway, it seems that to model baseline systems, the simplest approach is to
choose the split system EER (if listed) in section 6.8, and calculate the
fan power according to the G3.1.2.9 guidelines.   Therefore, the only time
you would have to do the calculation mentioned by Sam is for a proposed
design system where the fan energy is included in the EER.

A 15-ton packaged rooftop single-zone system having an EER of 8.6 (COP
of 2.5) is

specified for a building. The following table gives the design
specifications. How should

this be modeled?

Equipment parameter                               Value

Net Cooling Capacity (Btu/h)                   174,000

EER                                                         8.64

Gross Cooling Cap (ARI conditions)         182,000

A

The supply fan power is the difference between the gross and the net
cooling capacity.

Supply Fan Power  = (182,000 - 174,000 Btu / h) / 3.413 Btu /W h =  2343
W

 

>From the equation for cooling system COP, the cooling provided by the
compressor and

the condenser into the airstream in Btu/h per Btu/h of electrical power
input is:

COP  = (182,000 Btu / h) / {(20,128 - 2343 W)* 3.413 Btu / W h } = 3.0

Some simulation programs use an energy input ratio (EIR), which is
1/COP. In this case,

the EIR for this piece of equipment would be 1/3 or 0.333.

Karen, 

 

Since minimum cooling efficiencies in ASHRAE Section 6 are given for ARI
rating conditions, we need to use fan power at ARI rating conditions to
calculate the baseline EIR. You can get fan power at rating conditions for
different types of systems from AHRI website, or simply trust the attached
document that is included in eQUEST documentation. After calculate EIR for
the baseline, I use G3.1.2.9 to determine the fan power.

Hi Karen,

 

Apologies if I haven't been following closely enough, but I think you
may be unnecessarily complicating the issue for yourself... if in doubt,
turn to the 90.1 glossary (section 3) regarding whether the efficiency
metrics are/aren't inclusive.  

 

EER is a simple ratio of total input power to net cooling capacity.  It
includes fan power.  SEER is the same idea, only it's weighted over a
"normal" annual period.  Again it includes fan energy.

 

While pulling the (calculated) baseline fan energy out of the prescribed
EER/SEER values may result in "unrealistic looking" efficiencies, that's
normal because fans are a big part of energy used by packaged equipment!


 

Put simply and correcting your last statement:  All Appendix G baseline
model system types require fan energy calcs.  These energies can be
subtracted from the "fan-inclusive" EER/SEER efficiencies prescribed in
Section 6 to determine cooling EIR figures.  

 

Hope that helps!
