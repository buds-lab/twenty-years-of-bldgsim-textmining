Dear colleagues:
Chris Meek and Mehlika Inanici form the University of Washington will be generously hosting us for DIVA DAY 2014 on Oct 2 in Seattle. We are hoping that some of your will be able to join us.
Alstan, Christoph, Jeff, Jon and Kera

DIVA Day is heading West!<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2014?xg_source=msg_mes_network>

We are pleased to announce that the 3rd DIVA Day will be held in Seattle, Washington!

DIVA Day is a full-day event focused on the use of DIVA and associated simulation tools to improve and enhance design through performance-based workflows including presentations by practitioners and researchers at leading architectural, consulting, and engineering firms and universities. Conference sessions will include the introduction of new features by the DIVA Team, presentations of research and case studies by our speakers, and this year we will host a panel discussion on the evolving daylighting credits in codes and point systems like LEED v4. As always, the dinner following the event will provide excellent opportunities to meet and talk with speakers and other attendees.

Stay tuned for registration, program, speaker and travel information!

Message-ID: <CAJqH2e3mKfRd702_HyQQCr33QnsmuPdxMfeYysGCpERdsE6sGQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have tried installing Daysim 4.0 version but when I select the export
option for Daysim analysis in Ecotect - a window flashes and disappears
instantly. I have tried downloading the lower version 3.1 which comes with
a flash plugin. This neither works and while installing it asks for a
second disk as unable to locate the correct pathway. I am unclear what that
supposed to be.

Anyone using Daysim latest versions please help me. I appreciate quick
response.

Kind regards,

Greetings, light lovers!

A fresh batch of packages (installers) has been posted to the NREL Radiance GitHub site:
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.b.0

A couple of noteworthy doodads:
* These packages are based on Radiance 4.2.b, which now includes a new Hessian-based error control protocol for the ambient calculation
* The stdout from gendaymtx has a new format, which breaks the OpenStudio daylighting routines. We are working on a fix.

In addition, the Radiance 4.2.a.4 Windows package was updated, and now includes the GUI applications, such as rvu.exe. This idiot regrets the omissions.
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.a.4

Now go throw some virtual photons around.

 a small container house
Message-ID: <SNT150-W2136B74AC83EB376CA85CFB9060@phx.gbl>

Hello all,
I am simulating a small container house (22'x 18'x 8', two bedrooms, one bathroom, one living room and one kitchen) for a single western life-style family of 2 adults and 2 children. I am already done with the envelope and HVAC but now I am not sure how to proceed in applying typical occupancy loads in the house, only electric appliances by the way.
Does anyone know how can I build a typical hourly usage of this particular family in this particular small container house? I need a 24h-usage curve and 8760h-annual hourly usage data. With all these patterns, I could customize options and apply in the softwares.
This is kinda a lot to ask but I just wanted any ideas and a help please to know how and where to start. Anything is welcome.
Thank you.
Best,

Atila

That is a VERY small house. 22' x 18' is only 400 sq.ft. Maybe in Europe not in the US. Try 1,000 sf.

Atila,

This is a very small home. It's not different than a 400 sf 2-BR apartment.
You'd probably be on the high range of typical loads encountered in such
spaces considering you've got 4 people in there (some appliances do scale,
others don't).

The easiest would be to get the schedules and load profile from OpenStudio
for example (MidRiseApartment, load value and profile derived from
(Hendron, 2007)).

You could also try to customize it further based on the NREL research on
the matter, which expands from several sources including RECS.

The report has some good information for your problem starting page 36,
listing a bunch of MELs (miscellaneous Electric loads) with tables of
consumption per appliances and average unit/household for approx 100 MELs.
The spreadsheet has the same information but allows you to see the hourly
profile as well as customize the appliances you do have (In particular on
tab Detailed "MEL" you can input in column D the which MELs and how many
you know you have. There's also a list of sources in there, including the
first one "Bob's judgment" :) )

NREL  2014 Building America House Simulation Protocols :
http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/03/f13/house_simulation_protocols_2014.pdf

Supporting spreadsheet (will save you some googling time if you try to
locate them...) : Building America Analysis Spreadsheet for New
Construction
http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/building-america-analysis-spreadsheets

(For reference that's where it started : Hendron, 2007: Building America
Research Benchmark http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/42662.pdf )


Hope this help,
Julien

Message-ID: <a65e1532efdb4eba9e8b8133f7a6168f@AM3PR02MB0360.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com>



Hi everybody

This seems a really basic question to me, but  I have been unable to trace much information on it.

What methods exist for the definition of the length of the heating and cooling seasons prior to the performance of an energy simulation.

I am aware that the European Standard EN13790 provides a method for doing this, but are there are any other methods?

Alternatively is there any record of established national practice, eg heating on from Dec to Mar in a particular country and cooling on from Jun to Sept?

Sometimes simulation can generate cooling loads on a year round basis at certain times of day, although the cooling system is not normally on for 12 months of the year.

I am looking for a justifiable way to filter out these loads.

Sometimes it is mandatory and defined in the (local) law (ex: in NYC,
heating season is October 1st to May 31st for multiple dwellings)

In other cases it's likely more a combination of common sense/following
weather.

You could infer that pretty quickly yourself. Get some typical weather
data, at least daily. Whenever you've got X days dropping below say
13.5?C/55?F (I think 2<= X <= 5 is appropriate), you're probably in heating
season...

I just tested for NYC and it worked well. I also know in Paris, for
affordable housing, they use that with X=2.

Best,
Julien

I think typical occupancy loads for western houses would be near 0 during the day except for pets.  Mixed during weekends, maybe 50% outside of sleep time, less for a container house.  Electrical appliances will be plugged in and drawing energy throughout the day.  I suggest researching the energy draw of appliances while idle.  Appliance and electronics use will ramp up in the evenings and jump considerably at night after 8pm.  Just some thoughts...

That is a VERY small house. 22' x 18' is only 400 sq.ft. Maybe in Europe not in the US. Try 1,000 sf.

Hello all,

I am simulating a small container house (22'x 18'x 8', two bedrooms, one bathroom, one living room and one kitchen) for a single western life-style family of 2 adults and 2 children. I am already done with the envelope and HVAC but now I am not sure how to proceed in applying typical occupancy loads in the house, only electric appliances by the way.

Does anyone know how can I build a typical hourly usage of this particular family in this particular small container house? I need a 24h-usage curve and 8760h-annual hourly usage data. With all these patterns, I could customize options and apply in the softwares.

This is kinda a lot to ask but I just wanted any ideas and a help please to know how and where to start. Anything is welcome.

Thank you.
Best,


Atila

Anything specific re cooling season rather than heating season


Even when it comes to degree days, I am not so sure about the selection of the reference temperature.

Sometimes it is mandatory and defined in the (local) law (ex: in NYC, heating season is October 1st to May 31st for multiple dwellings)

In other cases it's likely more a combination of common sense/following weather.

You could infer that pretty quickly yourself. Get some typical weather data, at least daily. Whenever you've got X days dropping below say 13.5?C/55?F (I think 2<= X <= 5 is appropriate), you're probably in heating season...

I just tested for NYC and it worked well. I also know in Paris, for affordable housing, they use that with X=2.

Julien

Alan,
Similar to Julien's comment - and as usual, it depends. A judgement can
often be made by looking at the weather data. For degree days it is often
customary to use base 65 Degrees F for residential and base 55 Degrees F
for commercial applications. However, you need to add to your decision
making process questions like - what is the building type, occupancy, does
the building have a lot of internal space, large exterior exposures,
percent glazing, heavy or light internal loads, etc. You can look at load
profiles for similar buildings in similar climate zones . For example, you
could take the documentation for the 16 DOE reference buildings run across
multiple climate zones and get a feel for when the buildings go into either
heating or cooling mode and at what outdoor air temperature(s).

IBPSA-SF welcomes you all to the July 2014 event.

Christian Kohler from LBNL will present an overview of the suite of tools available to calculate window properties (thermal and daylighting) and annual building energy consumption as well as an overview of LBNL facilities used for testing innovative facade and control solutions that are optimized for low energy and comfort. Updates to WINDOW, THERM and RADIANCE include the ability to more accurately model the integration of shading and daylighting solutions with glazings. New databases (IGDB and CGDB) provide information on the optical properties of shading and daylighting materials. Updates to COMFEN provide additional performance features and cost estimates. The workshop will include several demo's of new software features and a Q&A. The tool updates will be complemented with an overview of recent test results from LBNL's Advanced Facade Test Facility and a brief overview of the new FLEXLAB facility for integrated building systems field measurement.

Christian Kohler is a scientific engineering associate at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He has been working in the Windows and Daylighting Research Group for 18 years. He works on software development of the THERM, WINDOW, COMFEN and Optics tools, with a focus on heat transfer algorithms. He is also involved in the development of highly insulating window systems and smart residential shaded windows. In the past he has worked on thermal testing of windows and window durability at LBNL. He is a member of ASHRAE and NFRC.

He received his Master's degree in Building Physics from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands in 1997.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Azimuth in equest
Message-ID: <000001cf9ad3$c7618df0$5624a9d0$@shaunmartinconsulting.com>

In equest, SHAPE = POLYGON  determines the x, y, z, azimuth.  Does anybody
happen know why a wall with an azimuth of -91.27 deg would be listed as
NORTH-EAST in the LV-D report?  Is there any easy way to fix this without
redoing all the polygons?  (Specifying the AZIMUTH does not work.)

Dear BLDG-SIMers,

We are holding a new construction *eQUEST* energy modeling training next
week that may be of interest to you.

The two-day training covers ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G energy modeling in
*eQUEST*, as used in USGBC's *LEED NC *program for *EA Credit 1 *and
Prerequisite 2 documentation. Appendix G modeling is also used in many
state incentive programs and for documenting the federal tax deduction for
energy efficiency (EPAct, Section 179D).

The training is *hands on*; there will be a lecture portion as well as an
exercise portion that attendees will perform along with the instructor.

The training is eligible for *14 continuing education hours* for LEED
AP/GAs, registered architects, AIAs, and professional engineers, as well as
14 in-service hours for New York State code officials.

The training will be held on July 15th-16th in New York, NY
<http://www.karpmanconsulting.net/sessionid9.php>. Click the link for more
information and to reach the registration page.

Karpman Consulting also offers training on existing building modeling in
eQUEST (Modeling 201) as well as intermediate eQUEST modeling (Modeling
301). Visit our training website
<http://www.karpmanconsulting.net/training.html> for upcoming dates and
more info.

Note that if you live or work in New York State SBC territory or do
business with NYSERDA, you are eligible for a 70% discount on training
tuition. Contact us for more details.

 Shaun,

Also, within DOE-2 simulations there are (3) orientations: the building, the space and the exterior/interior surface. Hence, you can easily have a -91.27 = northeast if you don't know all (3) orientations. You can see this in the LV- or verification reports for LOADS. You should be able to see this in the "viewer" as well (of which there are several).

Thanks Jeff and John.  Yes, the building azimuth is north-south (actually
180 deg).  The space azimuth is 0 deg.  Only the wall is 1.27 deg off
straight east.  

"East"  should be anything between 67.5 and 112.5 deg.

In eQUEST, there's a further nesting of the coordinates at the FLOOR level, i.e.,
     Building -> Floor -> Space
The FLOOR coordinates are particularly important, since the floor footprint (POLYGON = 
XXX, SHAPE = POLYGON) defines the origin and azimuth for the walls.

Degree Days shouldn't be used to define the length of the heating or cooling season, since 
they measure not only when heating/cooling is needed but also the severity of the 
heating/cooling need.  I suppose it's possible to count the number of days when there are 
non-zero heating/cooling degree days, but then you'd have to go back to the original 
weather data, but then it would be much better to simply do a simulation and record the 
number of days when there is a heating/cooling load.   In the final analysis, the length 
of the heating/cooling season is dependent on both the climate as well as the building 
itself.  In the same climate, a super-insulated building will have a much shorter heating 
season than a building with no insulation.

As others have already posted, there are many places around the world where the heating 
season is specified.  In China, for example, the heating season was originally defined in 
the 1960's to begin when the average temperature over 5 consecutive days is below 10 C.  
However, once defined by law, tradition and politics come into play, so that heating 
seasons are rarely ever changed.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Occupancy loads of a typical American typical family
 in a small container house

If you're simulating such a small house (~ 400 ft2), you need to scale appropriately the 
occupancy loads from other studies.  I wouldn't worry about differences in the hourly 
profiles, because those would be vary all over the place anyway, but daily totals will 
definitely differ from those of a typical single-family detached house. Lighting may scale 
with floor area, but not occupant heat-gain, while appliance internal gains will be 
somewhere in the middle (smaller appliances and probably fewer).  When I was working at 
LBNL, I used a bottoms-up method to derive an average internal load for houses by adding 
up the type of appliance x daily heat gain x percent heat gain in space.  The advantage of 
such a method is that it allows you to scale back the size or number of appliances for the 
house that you're modeling.  That work was done back in the early 1980's, so it could use 
a substantial upgrade, but IMHO the methodology is still valid.   If anyone's interested, 
send me an e-mail and I'll see if I can dig out and scan the relevant pages of the 
Technical Support Document.

Hi Joe,

 

I think it's just an internal error in equest.  My building, floor, and
space are all exactly north-south.  The only thing that is off slightly are
the coordinates of the space polygon, which gives me the 91.27 deg angle.
Something for version 3.66, I guess.

In eQUEST, there's a further nesting of the coordinates at the FLOOR level,
i.e.,
    Building -> Floor -> Space 
The FLOOR coordinates are particularly important, since the floor footprint
(POLYGON = XXX, SHAPE = POLYGON) defines the origin and azimuth for the
walls.

 Shaun,

 

Also, within DOE-2 simulations there are (3) orientations: the building, the
space and the exterior/interior surface. Hence, you can easily have a -91.27

LV- or verification reports for LOADS. You should be able to see this in the
"viewer" as well (of which there are several).

Shaun,

I don't use eQUEST, but I have converted DOE-2.2 input files to 
DOE-2.1E, and have never seen any problems with the building geometry 
once the correct transpositions have been done with the multiple 
coordinate systems.

How did you input the floor polygon? Could that be the cause for this 
discrepancy?  What is the actual azimuth for
the wall in the global coordinate system, anyway?

Joe

Message-ID: <287C2600FAB9C54CAA9F894C4CC837C805557B0B@catormsx02>

Hello,

Quick question about the NECB 2011 (Section 4.3.2.10). There are different factors (credits to account for):

-          "Personal control"

-          "Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Manual"

-          "Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Automatic"

What is meant by each of these? I'm assuming:

-          Personal Control - An on/off switch or task light.

-          Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Manual: A push-button for an occupancy override with timer (no switch).

-          Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Automatic: An automatic occupancy sensor.

If anyone can confirm my interpretation is correct, that would be great. Thanks.

Good afternoon Donald,

 

The reviewers only flag area discrepancies in the energy model if the areas
differ by more than 5-10% (gross versus net). All areas within the building
shell should be included in the models whether conditioned,
semi-conditioned, or unconditioned. If all areas are included in the models
and the variance is within 5-10%, I would not worry about it and just
include a narrative explaining the difference with your submission.

 

As for the architect, each modeling software has limitations which can
result in variances. Some of the possible issues which can contribute to
variances are rounding off of the dimensions for each space, curved walls in
the footprint, only modeling interior dimensions versus exterior dimensions,
etc. Again, if you are within 5-10% of the total gross area, the impact on
the modeling results tends to be negligible.

 

I hope this helps.  Have a nice day.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] NECB 2011 - Interpretation of 4.3.2.10

Hello,

Quick question about the NECB 2011 (Section 4.3.2.10). There are different factors (credits to account for):

-        "Personal control"

-        "Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Manual"

-        "Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Automatic"

What is meant by each of these? I'm assuming:

-        Personal Control - An on/off switch or task light.

-        Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Manual: A push-button for an occupancy override with timer (no switch).

-        Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Automatic: An automatic occupancy sensor.

If anyone can confirm my interpretation is correct, that would be great. Thanks.

Hi Joe,

 

I used the design development wizard.  



The wall in question (highlighted) runs from V8 to V9 of the space polygon
which reads 

"L1Space Polygon 7" = POLYGON

..

   V8               = ( 58.75, 0.2 )

   V9               = ( 58.85, -4.3 )

..

   ..

There is a slight difference in the x-coordinates (thus the -91.27 deg
azimuth). The building azimuth is 180, the floor azimuth is 360, and the
space azimuth is 0.  

 

Not a single wall in the model faces anything but N,S,E, or W. Yet this is
what LV-D says -

Shaun,

I don't use eQUEST, but I have converted DOE-2.2 input files to DOE-2.1E,
and have never seen any problems with the building geometry once the correct
transpositions have been done with the multiple coordinate systems. 

How did you input the floor polygon? Could that be the cause for this
discrepancy?  What is the actual azimuth for
the wall in the global coordinate system, anyway? 

Joe

Hi Joe,

 

I think it's just an internal error in equest.  My building, floor, and
space are all exactly north-south.  The only thing that is off slightly are
the coordinates of the space polygon, which gives me the 91.27 deg angle.
Something for version 3.66, I guess.

In eQUEST, there's a further nesting of the coordinates at the FLOOR level,
i.e.,
    Building -> Floor -> Space 
The FLOOR coordinates are particularly important, since the floor footprint
(POLYGON = XXX, SHAPE = POLYGON) defines the origin and azimuth for the
walls.

 Shaun,

 

Also, within DOE-2 simulations there are (3) orientations: the building, the
space and the exterior/interior surface. Hence, you can easily have a -91.27
= northeast if you don't know all (3) orientations. You can see this in the
LV- or verification reports for LOADS. You should be able to see this in the
"viewer" as well (of which there are several).

I am going to guess your Ploygon is part of a larger building. When you say
you set the Azimuth of the Polygon, what is the Azimuth of the Building
itself?

In equest, SHAPE = POLYGON  determines the x, y, z, azimuth.  Does anybody
happen know why a wall with an azimuth of -91.27 deg would be listed as
NORTH-EAST in the LV-D report?  Is there any easy way to fix this without
redoing all the polygons?  (Specifying the AZIMUTH does not work.)

Can you send me the DOE-2.2 input file (*.bdl)?  I can then run it 
through my converter and tell you what are the geometry inputs, i.e., X, 
Y, Z, AZIMUTH, HEIGHT, WIDTH, TILT actually being fed to DOE-2.

Hello Danielle,

I tend to agree with your interpretation.

Personal control is definitely an on/off switch controlled by individuals.
If you double check Table 4.3.2.10.A., you will find only handful spaces
allow such credit, i.e. laboratory, office, Judges' chambers, and patient
rm.

For automatic control device that is capable of turning off lighting
without occupant intervention, the general options include time schedule
and sensing occupants in the space. Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism ? Automatic
will yield better lighting savings in this manner.

Regards,

Cheney

The variances in floor areas are not due to software limitations, but to 
differences between how thermal modeling software and architectural 
drawings interpret floor areas.  In thermal modeling, the floor area 
apply to the area and volume of the enclosed space, or more 
specifically, to the air of the enclosed space. In architectural 
drawings, there are various conventions used in stating the gross and 
net floor areas, e.g., are the floor areas taken up by exterior or 
interior walls counted, etc?  If the user wants to input the gross or 
net areas shown on the architectural drawings into a thermal program, 
there's nothing in the software that prevents them from so doing.

Hi Danielle,

 

I think your assumptions sound reasonable - they provide more credit for
automatic occupancy sensor than manual but hopefully the Users Guide will
help clarify.

 

Devin, thanks for the heads up on the guide but the link provided didn't
work for me.  For others, if you go to the link below then click on
"Construction Publications" then "2011 National Energy Code for Buildings"
you should find the guide available for purchase.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] NECB 2011 - Interpretation of 4.3.2.10

 

Hello, 

 

Quick question about the NECB 2011 (Section 4.3.2.10). There are different
factors (credits to account for):

-          "Personal control"

-          "Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Manual"

-          "Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Automatic"

 

What is meant by each of these? I'm assuming:

-          Personal Control - An on/off switch or task light.

-          Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Manual: A push-button for an
occupancy override with timer (no switch).

-          Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Automatic: An automatic occupancy
sensor.

 

If anyone can confirm my interpretation is correct, that would be great.
Thanks.

Hi Danielle.

Based on a proposed code change that's proposed for inclusion in NECB 2015, which clarify the description, this is what I understand it is :

-       "Personal control" => Full manual on/off control

-       "Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Manual" => Full manual on/off control (i.e. same as above)

-       "Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Automatic" => full auto on/off control

Other type of controls (bi-level, auto off/manual on) are not accounted for in NECB 2011 Section 4.3.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] NECB 2011 - Interpretation of 4.3.2.10

Hello,

Quick question about the NECB 2011 (Section 4.3.2.10). There are different factors (credits to account for):

-          "Personal control"

-          "Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Manual"

-          "Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Automatic"

What is meant by each of these? I'm assuming:

-          Personal Control - An on/off switch or task light.

-          Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Manual: A push-button for an occupancy override with timer (no switch).

-          Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism - Automatic: An automatic occupancy sensor.

If anyone can confirm my interpretation is correct, that would be great. Thanks.

Hello Frederic,

How are you?

So there is no difference between Personal control and Occupancy-Sensing
Mechanism ? Manual? Taking Patient room in table 4.3.2.10.A as an example,
it has both Relative Absence of Occupants factor 0.1 and Personal control
factor 0.1. When a full manual on/off control is installed in such room,
both Occupancy control and personal control factors can be claimed? If not,
which one should be claimed in this case, since it generates different
control factors eventually?


Regards,

Cheney

Alan,
Similar to Julien's comment - and as usual, it depends. A judgement can often be made by looking at the weather data. For degree days it is often customary to use base 65 Degrees F for residential and base 55 Degrees F for commercial applications. However, you need to add to your decision making process questions like - what is the building type, occupancy, does the building have a lot of internal space, large exterior exposures, percent glazing, heavy or light internal loads, etc. You can look at load profiles for similar buildings in similar climate zones . For example, you could take the documentation for the 16 DOE reference buildings run across multiple climate zones and get a feel for when the buildings go into either heating or cooling mode and at what outdoor air temperature(s).

Anything specific re cooling season rather than heating season



Even when it comes to degree days, I am not so sure about the selection of the reference temperature.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Length of cooling (and heating) season

Sometimes it is mandatory and defined in the (local) law (ex: in NYC, heating season is October 1st to May 31st for multiple dwellings)
In other cases it's likely more a combination of common sense/following weather.
You could infer that pretty quickly yourself. Get some typical weather data, at least daily. Whenever you've got X days dropping below say 13.5?C/55?F (I think 2<= X <= 5 is appropriate), you're probably in heating season...

I just tested for NYC and it worked well. I also know in Paris, for affordable housing, they use that with X=2.

Best,
Julien

Hello Cheney.

Never been confronted with the case, so I?m eduguessing my way though the Trade-off Path.

Since the reference case never has any ?personal control?, I gather that it implies ?task lighting? while ?occupancy-sensing mechanism ? manual? implies ?general space control?.

Since personal control has a low factor (0.1), I don?t see a big problem with taking credit for both cases.

So, somewhat correcting my initial interpretation:

-       Personnal control = manual on/off control assigned to a single individual and normally related to task lighting or similar application

-       Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism = general space control

o   Manual = on/off switch

o   Automatic = motion detector or the like, switching on/off automatically

My two cents!

Hello Frederic,

How are you?

So there is no difference between Personal control and Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism ? Manual? Taking Patient room in table 4.3.2.10.A as an example, it has both Relative Absence of Occupants factor 0.1 and Personal control factor 0.1. When a full manual on/off control is installed in such room, both Occupancy control and personal control factors can be claimed? If not, which one should be claimed in this case, since it generates different control factors eventually?

Cheney

Hi Danielle.

Based on a proposed code change that?s proposed for inclusion in NECB 2015, which clarify the description, this is what I understand it is :

-       ?Personal control? => Full manual on/off control

-       ?Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism ? Manual? => Full manual on/off control (i.e. same as above)

-       ?Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism ? Automatic? => full auto on/off control

Other type of controls (bi-level, auto off/manual on) are not accounted for in NECB 2011 Section 4.3.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] NECB 2011 - Interpretation of 4.3.2.10

Hello,

Quick question about the NECB 2011 (Section 4.3.2.10). There are different factors (credits to account for):

-          ?Personal control?

-          ?Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism ? Manual?

-          ?Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism ? Automatic?

What is meant by each of these? I?m assuming:

-          Personal Control ? An on/off switch or task light.

-          Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism ? Manual: A push-button for an occupancy override with timer (no switch).

-          Occupancy-Sensing Mechanism ? Automatic: An automatic occupancy sensor.

If anyone can confirm my interpretation is correct, that would be great. Thanks.

Thank you, Frederic, for the clarification.

Now the new question is, which category time-scheduling devices belong to?
Am I right to say it is kind of automatic? Apparently ASHRAE treats
time-scheduling and occupant-sensing devices differently (Table G 3.2 in
Appendix G). If they are under the same category in NECB, time-scheduling
devices probably are overcredited? But certainly I don't think
time-scheduling will be the same as manual on/off switch.

Regards,

Cheney

Message-ID: <939DCF2311FEDB4982E93C955B9216251E668960@AMXExMb01.global.arup.com>

Hi,

IBC 2012 requires occupancy sensors on receptacles for space types. The C&S building I am modeling is using LEED V3 (90.1 2009).

I would like to claim savings on receptacle loads by reducing my receptacle schedule in the proposed model to 0% during unoccupied hours (down from 5%) and possibly lower my percentages during occupied hours to account for vampire loads.

Has anyone had success claiming savings for receptacle load reduction in terms of getting it through USGBC? Any documentation or procedures you could point me to that would be helpful?

Thanks,

Nicholas E Blanton LEED AP BD+C

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Occupancy loads of a typical American typical family
in a small container house

 

Hello all,

 

I am simulating a small container house (22'x 18'x 8', two bedrooms, one
bathroom, one living room and one kitchen) for a single western life-style
family of 2 adults and 2 children. I am already done with the envelope and
HVAC but now I am not sure how to proceed in applying typical occupancy
loads in the house, only electric appliances by the way.

 

Does anyone know how can I build a typical hourly usage of this particular
family in this particular small container house? I need a 24h-usage curve
and 8760h-annual hourly usage data. With all these patterns, I could
customize options and apply in the softwares.

 

This is kinda a lot to ask but I just wanted any ideas and a help please
to know how and where to start. Anything is welcome.

 

Thank you.
Best,

 

 

Atila

Hi Christopher,

You are only allowed to include the allowance of one or the other surface 
type (i.e. entrance or canopy/overhangs). You can pick the one that is the

Hi Christopher,

You are only allowed to include the allowance of one or the other surface type (i.e. entrance or canopy/overhangs). You can pick the one that is the most beneficial, but you can't include both.

Message-ID: <3462818cb669a605530475c63c1d00cb.squirrel@webmail.pitt.edu>

Hi all,

Does anyone have a resource (a completed study, web site, or methodology)
for understanding the changes to spectral transmittance (and thus solar
heat gain in spaces) based upon adding transparent thin film PV to a
window assembly - or guidance for how to model this in EnergyPlus or Open
Studio? Right now, all we seem to find is very general information about
transmittance in broad areas of the spectrum, and it doesn?t seem good
enough for modeling in EnergyPlus. Maybe someone has run these through
LBNL?s Window program? Any help would be fantastic.

Thanks,

Bill

Hi Bill,

I recommend measuring the transmission spectrum of the specific glazing 
you are interested. The measurement could be done using a standard 
spectrometer and an integrating sphere, as long as the wavelength range 
is broad enough (about 300nm to 2000nm should be fine). You do not need 
a fine resolution of the wavelength bands.

This may be of interest:

Lars,

Thanks very much. That is a great article by the way. I do not have a
measuring system right now but that is certainly an option in the future
if this goes anywhere. In the meantime I am realizing that there may be
templates to do this in Open Studio/Energy Plus as a preassembled system
(replacement/new windows) as opposed to overlaying an existing
installation. So if anyone is aware of published results of this type of
thing that would be great; I will also go looking.

Cheers,

Bill

Not to be contrarian, but I think there are cases where you can reasonably claim both allowances.

If you have a large illuminated/illuminating canopy connecting to a building entrance, such as with a with many hotel drive-up lobbies, and that canopy's lighting is illuminating (directly or indirectly) a substantial ground area separate from the main entry landing, then it would be appropriate to claim both allowances.  I would not claim canopy credit for smaller canopies at entrances which only pool light on the vertical entryway and/or the landing area.

This falls squarely into the logic and guidance that allowances may only be claimed for illuminated surfaces - you cannot claim fa?ade lighting when it does not exist in the proposed design, for example.

If there is a hard rule disallowing this practice, I would submit I have yet to run into it with any reviews.

My view is that claim both allowances are technically not allowed, even in 
the case indicated by Nick. However, it is difficult for the reviewer to 
check for this in most cases (such as if there are both doors with and 
without canopies, it may not raise a flag that both allowances for doors 
and canopies are included).

Hi Christopher, 

You are only allowed to include the allowance of one or the other surface 
type (i.e. entrance or canopy/overhangs). You can pick the one that is the 
most beneficial, but you can't include both.

My view is that claim both allowances are technically not allowed, even in the case indicated by Nick. However, it is difficult for the reviewer to check for this in most cases (such as if there are both doors with and without canopies, it may not raise a flag that both allowances for doors and canopies are included).

________________________________



Not to be contrarian, but I think there are cases where you can reasonably claim both allowances.

If you have a large illuminated/illuminating canopy connecting to a building entrance, such as with a with many hotel drive-up lobbies, and that canopy's lighting is illuminating (directly or indirectly) a substantial ground area separate from the main entry landing, then it would be appropriate to claim both allowances.  I would not claim canopy credit for smaller canopies at entrances which only pool light on the vertical entryway and/or the landing area.

This falls squarely into the logic and guidance that allowances may only be claimed for illuminated surfaces - you cannot claim fa?ade lighting when it does not exist in the proposed design, for example.

If there is a hard rule disallowing this practice, I would submit I have yet to run into it with any reviews.

All:

It's my sincere expectation that I haven't consistently taken this approach successfully so many times thanks to deception or unclear documentation.  On the contrary, I believe this is the correct application of the allowances table for such applications.  If anyone can find language to the contrary (disallowing multiple allowance types for entrances), I personally would be very much interested to learn more.

To take Cory's suggestion a step further, the following illustration is a photometric render I generated some years ago* for a canopy entryway study.  In this scenario, interior vestibule recessed downlights provide some entryway landing illumination in the form of light through the storefront, but the general ambient illumination for both the entryway vertical plane and the approaching walkway is via indirect asymmetric uplighting along the canopy columns, reflecting off of the tilted specular bronzed paneling.  While neither column fixture is explicitly illuminating the "main entry" in a direct fashion, they are together collectively illuminating the area under the canopy AND the main entryway.  As the uplights are performing a "double duty" in terms of illuminated surfaces, it seems quite appropriate to allow for both a "canopy" (or walkway) and a "main entry" allowance.  Thoughts?

~Nick

* My rendering skills have progressed since that time, but this particular example suits the point-at-hand particularly well!

Table 9.4.5 includes allowance for Building Entrances and exits (W/linear feet) and Canopies and Overhangs (W/ft2).  If a door has a canopy do you include the allowance for both the W/linear feet and the W/ft2 of canopy?

Thanks for any insights!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] 90.1-2007 Exterior Lighting Allowance calculation

All:

It's my sincere expectation that I haven't consistently taken this approach successfully so many times thanks to deception or unclear documentation.  On the contrary, I believe this is the correct application of the allowances table for such applications.  If anyone can find language to the contrary (disallowing multiple allowance types for entrances), I personally would be very much interested to learn more.

To take Cory's suggestion a step further, the following illustration is a photometric render I generated some years ago* for a canopy entryway study.  In this scenario, interior vestibule recessed downlights provide some entryway landing illumination in the form of light through the storefront, but the general ambient illumination for both the entryway vertical plane and the approaching walkway is via indirect asymmetric uplighting along the canopy columns, reflecting off of the tilted specular bronzed paneling.  While neither column fixture is explicitly illuminating the "main entry" in a direct fashion, they are together collectively illuminating the area under the canopy AND the main entryway.  As the uplights are performing a "double duty" in terms of illuminated surfaces, it seems quite appropriate to allow for both a "canopy" (or walkway) and a "main entry" allowance.  Thoughts?

~Nick

* My rendering skills have progressed since that time, but this particular example suits the point-at-hand particularly well!

Denver,

If you can find ASHRAE Standard 140 test results for these software packages one of them may have the other in the comparison (I think they usually have 6 in the test results). For example in the eQUEST test results it has Energy Plus, HOT3000 along with 3 other programs. See the results here:

Call for Papers???Smart, Sustainable and Healthy Cities

First International Conference of The CIB Middle East and North Africa Research Network (CIB-MENA 2014)

Hosted by: Abu Dhabi University, UAE 14-16 December 2014 
URL: http://www.adu.ac.ae/CIBMENA/
Email: cib-mena2014 at adu.ac.ae




The CIB Middle East and North
Africa
 Research Network CIB-MENA is organizing? its first international 
conference ?Smart, Sustainable and Healthy Cities?, which will be held 
in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates from 14 to 16 December 2014.?? We 
would like to invite you to submit your abstract/paper in the 
forthcoming conference.?? This conference will provide an excellent 
opportunity for everyone involved in the design, planning, construction,
 and management of the built environment to share research, best 
practices, experiences, technologies, and policies applicable, and 
offering solutions to the challenges of cities in the 21st century. More
 information in the call for papers below.


Theme
Cities
 in the Middle East and North Africa, like cities in other parts of the 
world, are experiencing an unprecedented wave of urbanization.? This 
urbanization is forecast to
continue and intensify in 
the next decades.? Many old cities are mushrooming to incomprehensible 
sizes and are forecast to approach or exceed 40 million people in the 
coming decade.? In other cases instant cities have emerged and developed
 from wilderness to full urban status within a single generation.

This
 rapid development poses a great challenge for all those involved in the
 design, planning, construction, and management of the built environment
 in order to provide sustainable, livable, equitable, and viable cities 
for all people. These challenges are so diverse and range from 
retrofitting existing building stock and infrastructure to the design 
and construction of new developments. They are also so diverse that they
 requires innovative interventions at different levels starting from 
urban and infra-structure planning on one end of the scale to interior 
design and material science on the other end
of the 
scale with many other levels in-between including architecture, civil 
engineering, urban design, and landscape architecture.? The challenges 
are also so diverse that sustaining cities will not be possible without 
interdisciplinary efforts. Decision makers will need to involve 
multidisciplinary teams of planners, architects, engineers,
environmentalists,
 scientists and economists to sustain the growth of these centers that 
are shaped by global factors, and aspire to retain local identities.? 
This conference will provide an excellent opportunity for everyone 
involved in the design, planning, construction, and management of the 
built environment to share research, best practices, experiences, 
technologies, and policies applicable, and offering solutions to the 
challenges of cities in the 21st century.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How can Low-e glass have dramatically lower U-Value?
Message-ID: <53D69C89.90303@gmail.com>

Bldg-Simers,

I wanted to see if Low-e glass saves energy in the far North (60 deg. N 
latitude or more).  My thought was to use the same U-value for the 
glass, but change the SHGC to account for the difference in solar heat 
gain due to the Low-e coatings.  To my surprise, manufacturers data for 
Low-e glass lists much lower U-values for the same double glazed units 
except with a Low-e coating on surface #3.

I'm having a hard time understanding how a coating a few molecules 
thick, improves the U-value so much.  The Architects in my firm say that 
the manufacturers are calculating an improved U-value to account for 
energy saved by blocking radiant heat lost (going from inside, out) in 
Winter.  They surmize this is done because our energy loads and modeling 
software cannot calculate radiant heat loses in Winter.  I'm not sure 
the weather data we use has hourly long wave radiation data that can be 
used to determine the available IR heat that can be blocked by the Low-e 
coating.  I don't think our energy modeling software can account for 
radiant heat leaving the building in Winter.

For example,

Pilkington 1" double pane clear glass using air, has a Winter U-value of 
0.47 Btu/hr.sq ft F and an SHGC of 0.71

The same Pilkington unit with their Energy Advantage Low-e coating has a 
Winter U-value of 0.33  and an SHGC of 0.67

PPG lists similar improvement for their Low-e coating


Is our energy modeling software inadequate to accurately model the 
effects of Low-e coating on glass? Both Summer and Winter?

Can we trust that the glass manufactures are giving us improved U-Values 
due to Low-e coatings that are valid?

Dear Randy,
What software are you using?

To properly model window coatings you could first use a 2D FEA package such
as Window, then for framing Therm, and for optical you could use Optics.
Then you can use the 2D model results as inputs to 1D software such as
Energy Plus.
http://windows.lbl.gov/software/default.htm

Also a nice, quick way to do analysis is to use COMFIN, (in same link) a
graphical UI to E+ that is setup to model windows that have been calculated
with Window/Therm/Optics.

By decreasing the emissivity of glass, you improve the glass' ability to
reflect long-wave energy.  If the glass doesn't have to absorb the heat,
then it's not going to convect and/or radiate that heat to the indoor
space (which is the method by which it improves the U-value).  That's
how a very thin coating can have such a dramatic impact on U-value.

I'm not sure if that answers your question!

When the building is in heating mode in the far north ( 60 degrees N latitude) the low emissivity coating on the 3d. surface of glass in the glazing unit works in a similar manner to that described below to block long-wave radiant heat transfer from the warm interior of the building to the outside.    The long-wave radiant heat is transmitted through the first layer of glass, then reflects off the low-E coating (on the 3d. surface of glass in the glazing unit) back into the heated interior space of the building.  

In this way, the radiant heat loss component of heat transfer from the building is blocked and the U-value of the glazing unit with a coating is significantly higher than a unit without a coating.  Hope this is helpful.

By decreasing the emissivity of glass, you improve the glass' ability to reflect long-wave energy.  If the glass doesn't have to absorb the heat, then it's not going to convect and/or radiate that heat to the indoor space (which is the method by which it improves the U-value).  That's how a very thin coating can have such a dramatic impact on U-value.

I'm not sure if that answers your question!

Bldg-Simers,

I wanted to see if Low-e glass saves energy in the far North (60 deg. N latitude or more).  My thought was to use the same U-value for the glass, but change the SHGC to account for the difference in solar heat gain due to the Low-e coatings.  To my surprise, manufacturers data for Low-e glass lists much lower U-values for the same double glazed units except with a Low-e coating on surface #3.

I'm having a hard time understanding how a coating a few molecules thick, improves the U-value so much.  The Architects in my firm say that the manufacturers are calculating an improved U-value to account for energy saved by blocking radiant heat lost (going from inside, out) in Winter.  They surmize this is done because our energy loads and modeling software cannot calculate radiant heat loses in Winter.  I'm not sure the weather data we use has hourly long wave radiation data that can be used to determine the available IR heat that can be blocked by the Low-e coating.  I don't think our energy modeling software can account for radiant heat leaving the building in Winter.

For example,

Pilkington 1" double pane clear glass using air, has a Winter U-value of
0.47 Btu/hr.sq ft F and an SHGC of 0.71

The same Pilkington unit with their Energy Advantage Low-e coating has a Winter U-value of 0.33  and an SHGC of 0.67

PPG lists similar improvement for their Low-e coating


Is our energy modeling software inadequate to accurately model the effects of Low-e coating on glass? Both Summer and Winter?

Can we trust that the glass manufactures are giving us improved U-Values due to Low-e coatings that are valid?

Randy,

Most higher performance windows have a coating that is both low 
emissivity and spectrally selective.  It's the spectral selectivity - 
blocking the parts of the solar spectrum beyond the visible - that 
reduces the SHGC. The low emissivity reduces the U-value, as others have 
noted.

The framing and glazing spacer selection is important.  Argon fill is a must have.

I went into this thinking that the Low-e coating would simply change the 
SHGC and not change the U-Values much.  I suspected that Low-e coatings 
would NOT save energy in the far North since they would block the wanted 
solar heat gain.  Since the manufacturers are claiming a U-value 
improvement from the Low-e coating, It looks like I can't calculate the 
savings using our normal energy modeling software. If the U-value 
improvement they give is in lieu of a more direct calculation method, 
and is accepted by the community (you all), then I will accept and move 
on to the next problem.

Thanks to all for your comments.

This is exactly what I mean by asking if our energy modeling software is 
inadequate.  Maybe a Senior Analyst or Building Scientist can do this, I 
don't think I can, or should.  If it takes specialty software to model 
long wave radiation coming in AND going out, then it seems like the 
functionality of Window/Therm/Optics should be built into our energy 
modeling software.

Thanks,

Randy

The LBL WINDOW program can calculate a U-factor and Solar Heat Gain Coefficient for a particular IGU, i.e., you create a glazing system with the different layers from the Glass Library, make sure the low-e coatings are on the right surface, and the program will do that calculation for the glazing system without a frame. If you want whole window properties, you can put the glazing system into either a generic frame or a frame modeled with THERM, and WINDOW will calculate the U-factor and SHGC for the whole window.

 

Energy Plus can correctly model a window with low-e glass, and uses algorithms from WINDOW that have been incorporated into the program. You can use a file generated by WINDOW to define the glazing system and frame and insert it into the Energy Plus IDF, or you can built it up natively in whatever interface (or no interface) that you use to run Energy Plus. The DOE2 simulation engine can also correctly model low-e glass.

To properly model window coatings you could first use a 2D FEA package such as Window, then for framing Therm, and for optical you could use Optics. 

Then you can use the 2D model results as inputs to 1D software such as Energy Plus.

Also a nice, quick way to do analysis is to use COMFIN, (in same link) a graphical UI to E+ that is setup to model windows that have been calculated with Window/Therm/Optics.

Randy,

I don't know what energy modeling software you're using, but you certainly don't need a finite-element analysis to do what you've described. Indeed, most of the tools used by regular contributors to this forum take into account all of the following glazing properties:

- U-value (as a function of low-e coating, gas fills, edge spacers, and so forth);
- SHGC as determined by spectral selectivity of coatings, absorption, re-radiation, and convection;
- Visible transmittance as a function of the glass composition

Most of the detailed data for many hundreds of actual glazing products and assemblies of these---needed if you want to use a particular set of inputs to represent this information accurately---can be found in the International Glazing Database from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) as viewed within their free Window 6 tool.

Once you have that data, you then need a software tool capable of modeling solar radiation striking your windows (including what passes directly through, what fraction is absorbed, and to which side of the glass this is re-radiated or convectively transferred), heat transfer from the air in the building to the interior of the glass at a given delta-T, and long-wave radiation trying to escape the building through the windows. This capability is common in all the major whole-building simulation packages.

If the software you're using does not account for these fundamental properties of glazing, perhaps you should consider upgrading your software, rather than abandoning your project.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] How can Low-e glass have dramatically lower U-Value?

I went into this thinking that the Low-e coating would simply change the SHGC and not change the U-Values much.  I suspected that Low-e coatings would NOT save energy in the far North since they would block the wanted solar heat gain.  Since the manufacturers are claiming a U-value improvement from the Low-e coating, It looks like I can't calculate the savings using our normal energy modeling software. If the U-value improvement they give is in lieu of a more direct calculation method, and is accepted by the community (you all), then I will accept and move on to the next problem.

Thanks to all for your comments.

Randy,

I think you're being misled in a way. ALL building simulation programs model long-wave 
radiation between the building surfaces and the environment, because otherwise you would 
get erroneous results, a case in point being  night-sky radiation that causes roofs to be 
significantly colder than the outdoor air at sunrise.  How different programs handle 
long-wave radiation varies, but that's more an issue of modeling methodology, whether to 
combine the radiative with the convective or calculating them separately, what temperature 
to assume for the
environment (ground, sky, air, etc.), etc.

As for the LBNL Suite of window simulation software (Window/Therm/Optics), I don't know of 
anyone except the NFRC Simulation Laboratories that use all three, and only for the 
purpose of getting an NFRC rating  of a specific product.  Outside of that context, the 
most I've seen people
do in building energy simulations is to obtain or create a "Window-4" file using Window 
(but not Therm or Optics) and then import that into their building energy software.  Even 
there, the main advantage is to get better representation of the angular-dependent 
properties of the window.
As far as capturing the long-wave radiation, inputting the U-value from an NFRC Rating or 
a Window-4 file should work fine.

Thanks Joe,

So you are saying that use of an improved U-value is a valid work-around 
in energy modeling software that can't or doesn't model long wave 
radiation in and out.  What if I put that improved U-value in there and 
the program then calculates the effect of long wave gains and 
losses...would we then have double accounted for the radiation effects?

Since I recognize you as also an expert at simulation weather data, do 
our typical hourly simulation weather data files contain sufficient 
information to model energy losses and gains from long-wave radiation?  
Especially gains from the Sun?

Randy,

When architects say things like, "our energy loads and modeling software
cannot calculate radiant heat losses in Winter", that is code for "why is
reducing WWR showing better results than any other enclosure strategy".

Randy,

I'd like to dissuade you of the idea that a U-factor that includes long-wave radiation is 
some sort of work-around.  In fact, it's the standard definition of U-factor as applied to 
windows because of their high conductivity.  Actually, the more I think about it, it would 
be the conduction-only U-factor that would be misleading. I suppose it is possible that a 
program might use such a U-factor, then also do a external radiative exchange, and thus be 
double-counting, but that seems unlikely because to do that you would have to solve for 
the external surface temperature, which would require a detailed heat balance, etc.

Sure, standard weather files have all the information needed to account for long-wave 
radiation, because during the day, the long-wave radiation from the sun is included in the 
reported solar radiation, which is all spectrum, while the long-wave radiation exchange 
with the ground, air, and sky are all calculated using assumed temperatures for each and 
generally minimal.  During the night, the main long-wave radiation exchange is with the 
night sky, for which there are various algorithms to estimate the night sky temperature, 
depending on the atmospherics, clouds, etc.

There is my problem.  For decades I've been trained to understand that 
energy exchange thru glass contains 2 components:  1) Conduction - 
Calculated using a U-Value with units of Btu per hour per SF per degree 
F., and 2) solar - calculated using the sun's energy output, adjusted 
for latitude, shading factor for glass, tinting, drapes, etc.

The U-Value is only for conduction...by definition, and is confirmed by 
looking at it's units (per degree F).  Now a few molecules of metallic 
coatings added to one surface adds to the U-value?  That's the part I 
find hard to believe.  Or at least I did until today.

I can accept that an improved U-value can be determined that would make 
it easy to calculate the overall equivalent heat transfer, averaged over 
a season, including the effect of long wave infrared radiation from the 
Low-e coatings.  That would make less sophisticated simulation programs 
be able to get better results. I guess I just need to verify that the 
improved U-value given is an NFRC value that has been determined using 
LBNL's Window software.

Thanks to all for helping me understand.  As others pointed out, E+ can 
accept a Window glass definition file and can also allow you to define 
glass parameters using layers.  I better figure that out next.

Dear building simulation experts,

The Symposium on Building Energy Uncertainty and Risk Analysis will be held in Atlanta on Sept 9, 2014.

The symposium offers an excellent opportunity to learn about the latest advancements and future challenges of building energy analysis under uncertainty. The outcomes of the NSF-EFRI supported research "Risk-Conscious Design and Retrofit of Buildings for low Energy" is the leading theme of the symposium. In the afternoon, the research team will present the major outcomes of the research conducted from 2010-2014.
The morning will be dedicated to an overview of the project and the research domain in general, highlighting accomplishments and remaining challenges, followed by a panel with perspectives from industry on the role of uncertainties in energy performance assessments and their ramifications for sound design and retrofit strategies.

For the full program and registration see: www.uqbem.gatech.edu<http://www.uqbem.gatech.edu>.
With the generous help of our sponsors and NSF we are able keep the registration fee as low as $ 75.

Note that the symposium is adjoined with the ASHRAE/IBPSA-USA Building Simulation Conference in Atlanta, September 10 - 12, 2014, see www.ashrae.org/simulation2014<http://www.ashrae.org/simulation2014> for more details.
For those of you that are planning to attend the ASHRAE-IBPSA conference, this is an excellent opportunity to enjoy both events in the same week.
The venue for the symposium on the Georgia Tech campus in midtown Atlanta is only a short MARTA ride away from the ASHRAE-IBPSA venue in the Atlanta Buckhead area.

A number of travel awards is available for students and young researchers. For application and deadlines, see www.uqbem.gatech.edu<http://www.uqbem.gatech.edu>

For any inquiries, don't hesitate to get in touch with the symposium coordinator:  Jeannie Kim, jihyun.kim at gatech.edu<mailto:jihyun.kim at gatech.edu>

I hope you will join us in Atlanta!

I have been following this discussion and I?m still a little unclear. As I understand it, the U-value for windows from manufacturers includes the long-wave radiation as well ? accounting for the effect of the emissivity of the window on the heat transfer and linearizing the radiation component at the winter and summer temperatures to create a combined radiation/conduction U-value.

I am not convinced that using one of these effective U-values in certain softwares will not double count the effect of long wave radiation.  For example, when I look at eQUEST?s inputs for simple window definitions, it has fields for:

-          Shading Coefficient:  to get the short wave solar radiation

-          Glass Conductance (U value)

-          Visible Transmittance: for daylighting calculations only

-          Outside Emissivity: from the DOE2 help: Outside surface IR emissivity of glazing. The default value (0.84) can be used for uncoated glass. Glass with an outside surface metallic coating would have OUTSIDE-EMISS between about 0.03 and 0.4 depending on the type of coating. Used to determine IR radiation leaving the glass and absorbed by the glass.?
So it seems to me that, at least in eQUEST, the IR heat transfer into and out of the room is calculated separately based on the user-input emissivity of the glass. If the U-Value included the effect of the emissivity, wouldn?t that be double counting the effect of short wave radiation?  Someone who knows more about window ratings or modeling software could please help clarify.

Randy,

I'd like to dissuade you of the idea that a U-factor that includes long-wave radiation is some sort of work-around.  In fact, it's the standard definition of U-factor as applied to windows because of their high conductivity.  Actually, the more I think about it, it would be the conduction-only U-factor that would be misleading. I suppose it is possible that a program might use such a U-factor, then also do a external radiative exchange, and thus be double-counting, but that seems unlikely because to do that you would have to solve for the external surface temperature, which would require a detailed heat balance, etc.

Sure, standard weather files have all the information needed to account for long-wave radiation, because during the day, the long-wave radiation from the sun is included in the reported solar radiation, which is all spectrum, while the long-wave radiation exchange with the ground, air, and sky are all calculated using assumed temperatures for each and generally minimal.  During the night, the main long-wave radiation exchange is with the night sky, for which there are various algorithms to estimate the night sky temperature, depending on the atmospherics, clouds, etc.

What if I put that improved U-value in there and the program then calculates the effect of long wave gains and losses...would we then have double accounted for the radiation effects?

Since I recognize you as also an expert at simulation weather data, do our typical hourly simulation weather data files contain sufficient information to model energy losses and gains from long-wave radiation?  Especially gains from the Sun?

As for the LBNL Suite of window simulation software (Window/Therm/Optics), I don't know of anyone except the NFRC Simulation Laboratories that use all three, and only for the purpose of getting an NFRC rating  of a specific product.  Outside of that context, the most I've seen people
do in building energy simulations is to obtain or create a "Window-4" file using Window (but not Therm or Optics) and then import that into their building energy software.  Even there, the main advantage is to get better representation of the angular-dependent properties of the window.
As far as capturing the long-wave radiation, inputting the U-value from an NFRC Rating or a Window-4 file should work fine.

Dear Randy,
What software are you using?

To properly model window coatings you could first use a 2D FEA package such as Window, then for framing Therm, and for optical you could use Optics.
Then you can use the 2D model results as inputs to 1D software such as Energy Plus.
http://windows.lbl.gov/software/default.htm

Also a nice, quick way to do analysis is to use COMFIN, (in same link) a graphical UI to E+ that is setup to model windows that have been calculated with Window/Therm/Optics.

Bldg-Simers,

I wanted to see if Low-e glass saves energy in the far North (60 deg. N latitude or more).

To my surprise, manufacturers data for Low-e glass lists much lower U-values for the same double glazed units except with a Low-e coating on surface #3.

I'm having a hard time understanding how a coating a few molecules thick, improves the U-value so much.  The Architects in my firm say that the manufacturers are calculating an improved U-value to account for energy saved by blocking radiant heat lost (going from inside, out) in Winter.

I'm not sure the weather data we use has hourly long wave radiation data that can be used to determine the available IR heat that can be blocked by the Low-e coating.  I don't think our energy modeling software can account for radiant heat leaving the building in Winter.

For example,

Pilkington 1" double pane clear glass using air, has a Winter U-value of 0.47 Btu/hr.sq ft F and an SHGC of 0.71

The same Pilkington unit with their Energy Advantage Low-e coating has a Winter U-value of 0.33  and an SHGC of 0.67

PPG lists similar improvement for their Low-e coating


Is our energy modeling software inadequate to accurately model the effects of Low-e coating on glass? Both Summer and Winter?

Can we trust that the glass manufactures are giving us improved U-Values due to Low-e coatings that are valid?

Randy,

Some of the commonly used simulation engines do account for the effects of low-e glass on window surfaces (for example, Energy Plus and ESP-r). That is to say that these engines estimate the long wave radiation from interior surfaces (and devices) to the interior surface of the glass and radiated through the various glass panes and interstitial gases to the sky/surroundings.

Low-e coatings effect the overall U-value of windows because of their effect on reflected long wave radiation. Which low-e coating is most appropriate for the North is important since the coatings will affect both the SHGC and the U-value, depending on their type, thickness and the surface they're applied to.

The results of a recent study of a Northern Canadian city (in NWT) concluded that hard coat windows, despite their higher cost and relatively higher U-value make sense in terms of both energy savings and cost-effectiveness.

I went into this thinking that the Low-e coating would simply change the SHGC and not change the U-Values much.  I suspected that Low-e coatings would NOT save energy in the far North since they would block the wanted solar heat gain.  Since the manufacturers are claiming a U-value improvement from the Low-e coating, It looks like I can't calculate the savings using our normal energy modeling software. If the U-value improvement they give is in lieu of a more direct calculation method, and is accepted by the community (you all), then I will accept and move on to the next problem.

Thanks to all for your comments.

Dear Bldg Simers,

I work for an SME here in Europe that provides sustainability consultancy for many years now. We use IDA ICE for building energy modeling and we are planning to purchase another tool now.

Highlighted features of the new tool would be:

*         easy to learn/use for both architects and engineers

*         faster model building (compared to  IDA ICE)

*         supporting the early stage design decisions

*         compatible with ArchiCAD 3D import

According to the software descriptions and user guides both IES and DesignBuilder is perfect for these. I want to hear now your practical experience with them as there are always bugs and hidden errors in these tools.

Any comments are appreciated.

Many thanks!

I've not used any of these for over 12 months. However, ...

DB is the easiest to model geometry in.

With IES it's a bit of a faff to get adiabatic surfaces into your model.
You can mess around with turning layers on and off, but this affects your
solar shading calc. In DB you can create adiabatic boundaries, whereas in
ICE anywhere inside a building body that isn't connected to an adjacent
surface is adiabatic (this is very convenient in my mind).

It's difficult to draw comparisons between speed of modelling. Whilst ICE
doesn't have the snap tools that others have, I don't see this as a
problem. Snaps are useful within the geometry paradigm of their respective
programs - the geometry modelling paradigm in ICE is not really dependent
on snaps. That said, it can seem a bit clunky. However, when you get beyond
geometry, I find IDA to be much more 'in one place' than IES, refreshingly
uncluttered and clipboard access to excel a superb feature.

The results viewer tool in IES (Vista) is a very good feature.

In terms of early stage stuff window area can be changed easily in DB and
IES. I don't think ICE has this feature but it would be trivial for the
developers to bring it in (they must already have the algorithms in place
from their ASHRAE 90.1 tool).

I found gbxml import in IES to be sufficiently robust with enough 'healing'
tools to make this a viable workflow. IES actually stores its 3d in a very
similar arrangement to gbxml (3d polylines). It can also import IFC. ICE
can import IFC and this also appears to be robust (Archicad does IFC, I
think).

When you get down to HVAC, it is important to note that ICE is using a HVAC
model even at a very simple level. This is not so in IES. If one wishes to
use HVAC models instead of merely post processing zone simulation results
you need to know what you're doing in ApacheHVAC. It has been a while since
I've used the latter. However, I have found the connection between the IES
model and the HVAC model to be fragile in the past.

In any of the tools, when you get more deeply into HVAC, you need a fair
degree of expert knowledge. For example, in Energyplus (DB's engine) I
found certain 'recipes' didn't work whilst in IDA you are quickly faced
with a data dump indicating some matrix decomposition hasn't worked
(whatever that is!). All the systems have basic templates to work from and
if you don't wander too far from these you shouldn't end up in much trouble.

There will be modelling nuances between the tools: Computational ones, such
as treatment of horizontal holes, or more functional ones, and even bugs
that a user must be mindful of. I'm not going to go into this here however.

I hope this has been helpful.

Chris

I don't use it most of the time, but when I have I've found that there's a
lot of old data on there. And, if there is new data it can get a bit
swamped.

I'm sure one of the issues is regional variations in glazing markets.

All the systems have basic templates to work from and if you don't wander too far from these you shouldn't end up in much trouble.

There will be modelling nuances between the tools: Computational ones, such as treatment of horizontal holes, or more functional ones, and even bugs that a user must be mindful of. I'm not going to go into this here however.

I hope this has been helpful.

Dear Bldg Simers,

I work for an SME here in Europe that provides sustainability consultancy for many years now. We use IDA ICE for building energy modeling and we are planning to purchase another tool now.

Highlighted features of the new tool would be:

?         easy to learn/use for both architects and engineers

?         faster model building (compared to  IDA ICE)

?         supporting the early stage design decisions

?         compatible with ArchiCAD 3D import

According to the software descriptions and user guides both IES and DesignBuilder is perfect for these. I want to hear now your practical experience with them as there are always bugs and hidden errors in these tools.

Any comments are appreciated.

Many thanks!

The IGDB is updated every two months with new submittals from manufacturers, which is the only way that the database is updated. We only delete records when requested to do so by the manufacturer, so there is data in the IGDB that goes back many years. In the WINDOW Glass Library you can sort by IGDB version (by clicking on the ?Source? column header) so you can see the oldest and newest records that way. 

 

The current IGDB version is 36.0 and is available for download on our website:

I don't use it most of the time, but when I have I've found that there's a lot of old data on there. And, if there is new data it can get a bit swamped.

 

I'm sure one of the issues is regional variations in glazing markets.

 

Your thoughts?

 

Chris
