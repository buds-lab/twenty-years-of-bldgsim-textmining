Subject: [Bldg-sim] Purchased Chilled Water Systems for DES LEED Modeling
Message-ID: <CAMdiMCLrX31sxpOMg16N+UN9mYAZMU=eNGjF=nHkUwKhH1TFAg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi BLDG-SIM Users,
We are working on a new LEED Office/Retail Project that intends to use the
Existing District Cooling System (Cooling Towers) for cooling. The proposed
building will have water cooled self contained units rejecting the heat to
the condenser water from the District Cooling Towers.

Based on the document from USGBC "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal
Energy in LEED 2009", we are looking into modeling this as Option 1 -
Building Stand Alone Scenario, where we disregard all the upstream
equipment energy. In the proposed building, this only constitutes for the
HEAT REJECTION on the towers.

However, our system type in Baseline comes out to be System 6 which is
changed to System 8 using the Table 3 in LEED Manual mentioned earlier.
System 8 is VAV with Reheat with cooling energy associated with Chillers
and Cooling towers. Also, we are to disregard the Purchased Cooling from
both baseline and proposed to keep the model DES neutral.

1. Does Chillers, Chilled Water Pumps, Condenser Water Pumps, and Cooling
Towers modeled in the Baseline need to be all considered as part of the
Purchased cooling and thus excluded from the Savings calculations?
2. If we have a Condenser water booster pump for the new building in the
proposed building, should we also model a condenser water pump for the new
building at 19 W/GPM (ASHRAE 90.1)  for baseline and include both of them
as part of the downstream equipment energy?

Your help is very appreciated.

Thanks and we look forward to your suggestions.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed 1.3 has been
	released
Message-ID: <012d01ce4761$59d90e00$0d8b2a00$@gov>

We are pleased to announce the release of the Building Controls Virtual Test
Bed 1.3.

 

The following changes have been made compared to version 1.2:

 

* TRNSYS  has been added as a client program.

* The Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation import interface has
been added.

* The example files have been updated for EnergyPlus 8.0. 

 

The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) is a freely available
open-source software environment that allows expert users to couple
different simulation programs for co-simulation, 

and to couple simulation programs with actual hardware. For example, the
BCVTB allows to simulate a building in EnergyPlus and the HVAC and control
system in Modelica, 

while exchanging data between the software as they simulate. The BCVTB is
based on the Ptolemy II software environment. 

The BCVTB allows expert users of simulation to expand the capabilities of
individual programs by linking them to other programs. 

Due to the different programs that may be involved in distributed
simulation, familiarity with configuring programs is essential.

 

Programs that are linked to the BCVTB are

 

* the EnergyPlus whole building energy simulation program,

* the Modelica modeling and simulation environment Dymola,

* the MATLAB and Simulink tools for scientific computing,

* the Radiance ray-tracing software for lighting analysis,

* the ESP-r integrated building energy modeling program,

* the TRNSYS system simulation program, 

* Functional Mock-up Units (FMU) for co-simulation,

* the BACnet stack, which allows exchanging data with BACnet compliant
Building Automation System (BAS),

* the analog/digital interface USB-1208LS from Measurement Computing
Corporation that can be connected to a USB port. 

 

In addition to using programs that are coupled to Ptolemy II, Ptolemy II's
graphical modeling environment can also be used to define models for control
systems, for physical devices, 

for communication systems or for post-processing and real-time
visualization.

Dear all,

For a LEED EAp2/EAc1 energy model, does the following above-grade wall
situation fall under a mass wall or a steel-framed wall in the baseline?

8" CMU wall (load bearing) with steel studs to the interior just to create
a cavity for the batt insulation etc.

Thanks,

Ramana,

 

Per Table G3.1 section 5b, the baseline is always a steel-framed wall
for Appendix G modeling. So you get to take credit for additional
thermal mass.

Thanks for the update Thierry!

I've tried the TRNSYS example, but could not get it to work since I don't
have the DLLs for the new TRNSYS Type 6666 and Type 6667 used by the
example.
I could not find the DLLs anywhere in the BCVTB install directory. Should I
download them from somewhere else?

To round out the topic:  Outside the context of LEED/Appendix G modeling (if you're concerned with prescriptive compliance), the threshold of what constitutes a mass wall is based on heat capacity (thermal mass), defined further in the 90.1 definitions.

I once looked hard at the issue and came away with this easy rule of thumb: any wall construction including a course of standard 4" brick exceeds the threshold and can be considered a mass wall.  I would expect pretty much any wall including CMU to follow suit, filled or not.

Ramana,

Per Table G3.1 section 5b, the baseline is always a steel-framed wall for Appendix G modeling. So you get to take credit for additional thermal mass.

Dear all,

For a LEED EAp2/EAc1 energy model, does the following above-grade wall situation fall under a mass wall or a steel-framed wall in the baseline?

8" CMU wall (load bearing) with steel studs to the interior just to create a cavity for the batt insulation etc.

Thanks,
Ramana Koti.

Bldg-Simers -

As we all strive to coalesce and concentrate resources on energy modeling,
we are happy to announce the launch of a website designed to support our
local users group here in Boise, Idaho.

https://sites.google.com/site/idlbsug/home

However, the site has lots of modeling resources available to everybody
including:

-  calculation spreadsheets developed by our lab and others (
https://sites.google.com/site/idlbsug/modeling-resources/calculation-spreadsheets
)
-  a current draft of our ongoing living document of modeling protocols and
procedures (
https://sites.google.com/site/idlbsug/modeling-resources/ui-idl-simulation-protocols-draft
)
-  a video archive of our groups presentations, most recently posted is a
talk from Chris Baker of the Weidt Group on integrating energy modeling
early and often throughout the design process (
https://sites.google.com/site/idlbsug/video-archive)

Enjoy! Any feedback is welcome!

Cheers,

Hi Max

Nice job compiling this. I would also add climate consultant, a free software developed at UCLA that has a sun shading chart in which you can use epw files to design your shading system as a function of outdoor temperature and solar geometry.

Although these have EnergyPlus input files, check out the Secondary School -  there's a spreadsheet with each building (in the Version 1.3_5.0 updated 9/27/10 .ZIPs, RefBldgSecondarySchoolNew2004_v1.3_5.0_SI.xls) with all the schedules documented.  The next version (1.4_7.2) is just an update of EnergyPlus versions.

Hi Amit,

As per the guidance for district or campus thermal energy in LEED mentioned
that:

*"In Option 1, the energy model?s scope accounts for only downstream
equipment. *This scenario is modeled in accordance with ASHRAE 90.1
Appendix G requirements with the following exceptions:



   - The energy source is modeled as purchased energy in both the Proposed
   and Baseline buildings for all air handlers, fan-coil units, and other
   downstream equipment serviced by district or campus energy systems .....


   - Where necessary, building Baseline HVAC system types from Tables
   G3.1.A and G3.1.B are modified to be consistent with the purchased energy
   source (Table 3) .... "


So, only downstream equipment shall be modeled in both the proposed and
baseline buildings and Chillers, Chilled Water Pumps, Condenser Water
Pumps, and Cooling Towers (upstream equipment) shall NOT be modeled in
option 1.

If the condenser water pump is part of the LEED building and downstream to
DES, shall be modeled as per ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G. If CW pump upstream of
the building even it's a bosster shall not be modeled and considered as a
part of DES.


Hope that help!

Dear colleagues:

As in previous years, we will be offering a three day Executive Education program on Daylighting Buildings<http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/programs/daylighting-buildings-1> at Harvard from July 10-12 2013.

Course participants will acquire a range of daylighting design analysis techniques ranging from rules of thumb to state-of-the-art computer simulations and high dynamic range photography for glare analysis. The main simulation program used will be DIVA<http://diva4rhino.com/>, a Rhino plug-in that supports the calculation of daylight availability (DAYSIM), annual daylight glare probability maps (Evalglare), thermal load calculations (EnergyPlus) and radiation maps (GenCumulativeSky). The assumptions underlying these programs will be discussed in detail.

The first two days will consist of formal instructions, in-class discussions, hands-on software tutorials, and exercises. Participants will also be given the opportunity to calibrate their personal digital cameras to take HDR images and learn several ways to quantitatively evaluate these images. During the last day, participants will be given the opportunity to apply the newly acquired analysis techniques to ongoing projects of their own.

If you want to make this your "daylighting week" you could further join us on the following Monday, July 15, for DIVA DAY in New York. (Details to follow.)

Best,

Christoph

Subject: [Bldg-sim] White Box Technologies launches Web-based weather data
 for building energy simulations
Message-ID: <518CAA45.202@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

(please excuse any cross-postings)

White Box Technologies is pleased to announce the launch of *WBT Weather Data for Energy 
Calculations*, a web site providing instant Web access to typical year and historical year 
weather files for thousands of locations around the world created from recorded weather 
data going back as far as 30 years to as recent as the past week.  This website has been 
created by a long-time building energy modeler with several decades' experience in 
processing weather data for use in building energy simulations.

For typical year data, this Web site features ASHRAE's *IWEC2 weather files for 3,012 
international locations*, as well as TMY3, CWEC2, and CZ2010 weather files for US, 
Canadian, and California locations, respectively.  IWEC2 weather files cost $35 each, the 
other sets are public data hosted with permission and are free.

For historical data, this Web site contains *weather files from 2007 to 2012 for over 
10,000 locations around the world, including over 1,500 in the US and 300 in Canada*. 
Older weather files going back to 1980 are also available and can be be generated on 
request. The historical weather files have been processed by WBT and cost $50 each. A 
typical year weather file can also be produced on request for any location with 7 or more 
years of historical data.

All weather files are provided in two formats: *.BINM for use in DOE-2-derived programs 
and *.EPW for use in EnergyPlus-derived programs, including the DDY file. The IWEC2 files 
also contain an archival *.CSV format, and the historical files an archival *.FIN4 
format.  Discount prices for large orders and subscriptions are also available.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Baseline VAV OA vs Proposed DOAS OA
Message-ID: <DUB103-W57DD6BAEA58C5BC2978DF0E0A50@phx.gbl>

Hi all,

I'm looking for guidance on which number to use for my baseline OA when compared to the proposed system.

The proposed HVAC system is DOAS - FCUs. OA requirements according to ASHRAE 62.1 are 10,216 cfm. However, to satisfy exhaust requirements, the total system ventilation, i.e. OA as it's a DOAS, is 13,160 cfm.

Does the baseline OA need to equal 10,216 or 13,160 cfm?

Thanks

D?nal

In my opinion, the baseline case OA should be equal to the proposed OA. OA required by 62.1 is only a basis for reference.

Hi Donal,

As OA in the proposed model must equal the OA in the baseline model so you
have to use 13,160 CFM (better energy saving chance on the proposed than
10,216 CFM).

There are more details on Example 6-III "Calculation of Fan Power Energy,
Floor-by-Floor System" at ASHRAE 90.1-2007 User's Manual

Hi - Is anybody aware of a paper or study that's been done that surveys
packaged terminal heat pump supplemental heating control strategies, and
how manufacturers are actually controlling the units? Thanks.

Message-ID: <FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA3226113AAD51@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>

Greetings simulationists, photon wranglers, et al.,

It is my pleasure and an honor to announce the 12th International Radiance Workshop, which will take place August 12-14th 2013 in Golden, CO, USA at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).  The format will be the same as in recent years, with the first day being full of tutorials and software demonstrations, and days two and three reserved for presentations of work you've done with Radiance over the last year.

On day one, we will have Greg Ward presenting on new features/functionality added to the Radiance code since last year's workshop, as well as a primer on BSDFs and their generation with, and use in, Radiance. Andy McNeil may even have a few words about an enhanced daylight coefficient method that Radiance is being adapted to utilize (those kooks at Berkeley decided three phases weren't enough). Jan Weinold (Fraunhofer ISE) will be talking about his glare metric (DGP) and his tool (Evalglare), while a mystery guest from Boise, ID will offer additional perspectives on glare metrics.  Kera Lagios (Solemma LLC / Lam Partners) will be giving a demo on DIVA, and members of NREL's Commercial Buildings Research Goup will be giving a demo on whole building energy simulations with Radiance and EnergyPlus, using the OpenStudio Application Suite and SDK.  

Days two and three are what *you* make of them, really.  Time slots for user presentations will be contingent on how many people we get to come out, but figure about 20 minutes per person. What has Radiance done for you lately? We all want to know/see! 

We will be webcasting the workshop, so if you can't make it out to Colorado, no worries, you can enjoy the proceedings from wherever you are, via the intertubes. We will also be recording the presentations and posting them online for future viewing.

This event will take place on NREL's main campus, in one of our newest buildings, the Research Support Facility (RSF) which is one of the largest net-zero energy facilities in the entire world. Daylighting was a core component of the integrated high-performance building design, and its performance was predicted with Radiance. Come see a real life example of the power of Radiance's predictive capability! We also have a nicely daylit cafeteria parking garage, and a new building (ESIF) housing first of its kind grid-level simulation and physical test facilities, and a rather zippy supercomputer which will be online by the time you all come out here. We'll try and tour as many of these facilities while you're here as well. More on the buildings, here:

http://www.nrel.gov/esi/esif.html
http://www.nrel.gov/sustainable_nrel/buildings_garage.html
http://www.nrel.gov/sustainable_nrel/buildings_cafe.html

Lastly, I am happy to announce that there will be no registration fee, for speakers and students. (!) The usual banquet/dinner will be an out of pocket expense, but hey, registration is free, so quit complaining. Seriously, we'll find a place that can feed us all and we'll have a good time and make inspiring speeches. 

We will be posting a web page with all this info and more, but I wanted to get the word out so you can mark your calendars and start planning. Oh, and to that end, NREL is located in Golden, CO, USA, which is about 15 miles west of Denver. If you're flying in, you'd want to fly into Denver International (KDEN). More on getting here, here:
http://www.nrel.gov/about/golden.html

More on staying here, here:
http://www.nrel.gov/about/golden_info.html

Since there is no registration fee, registration is simple. Send an email to me (robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov).  If you are a foreign national, there is extra paperwork we need to do. If you are from Iran, Syria, Cuba, or , unfortunately you will not be able to attend in person. However, since we are webcasting the event, we will be able to support those of you from these countries who cannot attend in person by allowing you to present via webex. Please let me know ASAP if you will need this option.

Please do the following, ASAP:
- Email me your intent to participate in Golden: 
- Please indicate your citizenship status. 
- Please indicate whether you're coming for day one, two, three or some combination thereof.
- Please submit a brief abstract on your presentation.

Thanks for reading, and we're looking forward to seeing you all in beautiful Colorado in a few months! 

P.S.
Bring your hiking boots.

Presentation 1
A demonstration of AECOSim Energy Simulator, the latest GUI for EnergyPlus
Drury B. Crawley, Director, Building Performance, Bentley Systems, Inc.
Description: AECOsim Energy Simulator (AES) is a full-featured, graphic interface for building performance simulation built from the ground up based on the latest EnergyPlus (v7.2) simulation engine.  AES was initially released by Bentley Systems in September 2011.  This demonstration will first cover the interface including the ribbon bar; tree for navigating spaces, walls, windows, doors, ceilings, roofs, internal loads, HVAC components, and zoning; BIM interface to visualize building models.  How to create an AES building model will also be shown: Conceptual Design (13 inputs, sketch the building outline, select HVAC system); import 2-D CAD and trace the building and spaces; import gbXML; or import graphics (bitmap, JPEG, GIF, PDF) and trace spaces.
Then, the HVAC Designer will be shown along with 31 preconfigured HVAC and SWH systems (preconfigured systems automatically create the all the necessary EnergyPlus nodes, branches, and connections). The HVAC Designer makes it easy to configure the more than 50 HVAC Designer components and create or modify systems using a visual drag and drop system. Finally, automated creation of baseline and budget buildings for ASHRAE 90.1 will be shown as well as results from ASHRAE RTS/heat loss and EnergyPlus simulation.
About the Speaker:  Dr. Crawley leads the team developing a new generation of building performance software for energy and sustainability at Bentley Systems, including AECOsim Energy Simulator, among others (Open Plant with HVAC, Hevacomp Simulator, Hevacomp Mechanical Designer, and Hevacomp Electrical Designer). (AECOsim Energy Simulator is a BIM-based, full featured graphic interface for the U.S. Department of Energy flagship EnergyPlus building simulation program.)
With more than 30 years of experience in buildings energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainability, he has worked in engineering software development, government research and standards development organizations, as well as building design and energy consulting companies. Prior to joining Bentley in early 2010, he managed the U.S. Department of Energy's building energy software tools research and development including EnergyPlus, OpenStudio plugin for Google (now Trimble) SketchUp, Energy-10, and DOE-2. He also led DOE's Commercial Building Initiative - working to achieve cost-effective low-energy commercial buildings, including the Commercial Building Energy Alliances and Commercial Building Partnerships which included the owners of more than 20% of the commercial building floor space.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LBNL releases version 1.4 build 1 of the Modelica
	"Buildings" library
Message-ID: <CACXXVcj=k6vPUaT9UdWmb5hiSQTekOi1RoAgnaTKUVHPEgygVA@mail.gmail.com>

LBNL releases version 1.4 build 1 of the Modelica "Buildings" library and
version 1.2.0 of the "BuildingsPy" Python package.

In Buildings 1.4 build 1, models for heat conduction in phase change
materials have been included. New in this version is also an interface that
allows calling Python from a Modelica function. Various issues have been
fixed and models have been changed to conform with the Modelica Language
Specification. This has been done to increase compatibility with
OpenModelica, which is work in progress.

For a detailed list of changes, see
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/v1.4_build1/help/Buildings_UsersGuide_ReleaseNotes.html

In BuildingsPy 1.2.0, stricter tests for running the unit tests have been
implemented. The unit tests now check for better conformance with the
Modelica Language Specification.

The development of the Buildings library and of BuildingsPy has been moved
from subversion to github. The development pages are
https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings
and
https://github.com/lbl-srg/BuildingsPy
This has been done to facilitate collaborative developments.

Message-ID: <CAN1ZnDt6FsrvKaQKVjhq-kMJfsR6A9PaBS8m7J-FQgpacN3bvg@mail.gmail.com>

Good afternoon Energy Modelers!

Join us *Tuesday, May 21* for the next meeting of the Rocky Mountain Energy
Simulation Engineers (RMESE). *Ellen Franconi from Rocky Mountain
Institute*will be our guest speaker for the evening.

Ellen will talk about topics touched on in her recent RMI blog post - "Show
Me The Money: Boosting Investor Confidence Through Better Building Energy
Efficiency Modeling."  The context for the discussion is summarized below.
Her blog was picked up by the Environmental Defense Fund Investor
Confidence Project, which can be found at http://www.eeperformance.org/.



Today?s interest in energy efficiency is perhaps the strongest it has ever
been. To capitalize on the investment potential, the risk associated with
retrofit energy savings estimates need to be identified. Project savings
risk can be partially addressed through uncertainty analysis, modeler
credentialing, and establishing modeling process requirements. Continued
progress in these areas will help energy projects be considered alongside
traditional investments. Coupling these advancements with new financing
mechanisms that target outcome-based performance provides the levers needed
to realize retrofit building investment opportunities. The approach offers
a winning triple play that will provide business profit, new U.S. jobs, and
environmental benefits. To realize its benefits will required energy
modelers to expand their role and rethink the way their work is presented.
Specifically, energy modelers will need to account for direct and indirect
benefits and risks associated with energy project performance improvements.

We will be meeting at *The RMH Group?s office in Lakewood at 6:00 pm
Tuesday, May 21 *for* *a short presentation, appetizers, and drinks. There
will be a $10 / person fee to cover the cost of the food and drinks.

The RMH Group is located roughly 1 mile east of NREL at:

The RMH Group, Inc.

12600 W Colfax Avenue

Suite A-260

Lakewood, CO 80215

Please RSVP to Jessie Jones at jjones at rmhgroup.com or (303)312-4641 so that
we can prepare enough food and beverages. This is not invite only- so pass
the word on to coworkers, colleagues, and other industry professionals who
may be interested.

Thank you,
*RMESE Steering Committee*

(please excuse the cross-postings)

White Box Technologies is pleased to announce under agreement with ASHRAE the launch of 
*WBT Weather Data for Energy Calculations,* a web site providing instant access to typical 
year and historical year weather files for thousands of locations around the world.  The 
data are created from recorded weather data going back as far as 30 years to as recent as 
the past week.

For typical year weather data, the web site features *ASHRAE's IWEC2 weather files for 
3,012 international locations*, as well as TMY3, CWEC2, and CZ2010 weather files for US, 
Canadian, and California locations, respectively.  IWEC2 weather files cost $35 each, the 
other sets are public data hosted with permission and provided free of charge.

For historical weather data, this Web site features *weather files from 2007 to 2012 for 
over 10,000 locations around the world, including over 1,500 US and 300 Canadian 
locations.* Older weather files going back to 1980 are also available and can be generated 
on request. The historical weather files have been processed by WBT and cost $50 each.  
Typical year weather files can also be produced on request for any location with 7 or more 
years of historical data.

All weather files are provided in two formats: *.BINM for use in DOE-2-derived programs 
and *.EPW for use in EnergyPlus-derived programs, including the DDY file. The IWEC2 files 
also contain an archival *.CSV format, and the historical files an archival *.FIN4 
format.  Discount prices for large orders and subscriptions are also available.

ASHRAE's IWEC2 files are made possible through ASHRAE Research funding.  The WBT Weather 
Data for Energy Calculations web site  has been created by a long-time building energy 
modeler with several decades' experience in processing weather data for use in building 
energy simulations.

Hi All,


I have a question regarding EnergyPlus HVAC system modeling:

How to model a 2 pipe FCU/UV in EnergyPlus because it seems to require that
I specify a cooling coil name which I don't have (I don't have a cooling
plant)?

Thanks!

Hi Qinpeng,

Cooling coil availability schedule can be used to make it unavailable.

 From E+ IO Reference

Fan coil units can be 4-pipe or 2-pipe. For 4-pipe units there are 2 
supply pipes and 2 return
pipes. For 2-pipe units there is a single supply pipe and a single 
return pipe and the supply is
switched between hot and chilled water depending on the season. We model 
4-pipe units, but
the 4-pipe model can be used to model 2-pipe units by using the coil 
availability schedules to
make sure that either hot or chilled water is exclusively available.

Thanks,
Chandan

For a heating-only unit, you can use the unit heater or unit ventilator 
instead of the fan coil.

Greetings simulationists, apologies for the cross postings, yadda yadda,

The 2013 edition of the International Radiance Workshop will take place August 12-14 at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), in Golden, CO, USA. This annual event is a gathering of Radiance practicioners -- lighting designers, engineers, architects, software developers, researchers, artists, students, and educators -- where we show off our work with the lighting simulation tool known as Radiance (and the many that use Radiance). 

For those interested in attending the workshop (in person or via webcast), please visit the following url for details:

http://www.nrel.gov/buildings/2013_radiance_workshop.html

I hope to see you in Colorado this August!

I don't fully understand this use case. Do you want for instance to connect
two simulators (e.g. TRNSYS and Dymola) to one instance of EnergyPlus?

Thanks!

Hi Thierry,

 

do you know if there is a way to connect more than one componet to
energyplus, for example to connect ptolemy and another simulator to exchange
data with it at the same time?

 

Thanks!

 


Am Donnerstag, 2. Mai 2013 20:17:47 UTC+2 schrieb Thierry Nouidui:

We are pleased to announce the release of the Building Controls Virtual Test
Bed 1.3.

 

The following changes have been made compared to version 1.2:

 

* TRNSYS  has been added as a client program.

* The Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation import interface has
been added.

* The example files have been updated for EnergyPlus 8.0. 

 

The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) is a freely available
open-source software environment that allows expert users to couple
different simulation programs for co-simulation, 

and to couple simulation programs with actual hardware. For example, the
BCVTB allows to simulate a building in EnergyPlus and the HVAC and control
system in Modelica, 

while exchanging data between the software as they simulate. The BCVTB is
based on the Ptolemy II software environment. 

The BCVTB allows expert users of simulation to expand the capabilities of
individual programs by linking them to other programs. 

Due to the different programs that may be involved in distributed
simulation, familiarity with configuring programs is essential.

 

Programs that are linked to the BCVTB are

 

* the EnergyPlus whole building energy simulation program,

* the Modelica modeling and simulation environment Dymola,

* the MATLAB and Simulink tools for scientific computing,

* the Radiance ray-tracing software for lighting analysis,

* the ESP-r integrated building energy modeling program,

* the TRNSYS system simulation program, 

* Functional Mock-up Units (FMU) for co-simulation,

* the BACnet stack, which allows exchanging data with BACnet compliant
Building Automation System (BAS),

* the analog/digital interface USB-1208LS from Measurement Computing
Corporation that can be connected to a USB port. 

 

In addition to using programs that are coupled to Ptolemy II, Ptolemy II's
graphical modeling environment can also be used to define models for control
systems, for physical devices, 

for communication systems or for post-processing and real-time
visualization.

Note: EnergyPlus receives a vector as input in the BCVTB.

Let's assume (for your first problem) you would like EnergyPlus to get data
from simulators A and B. 

One way to do could be: 

.         compute in simulator A the data you would like to input to
EnergyPlus,

.         compute in simulator B the data you would like to input to
EnergyPlus,

.         use the VectorAssembler actor in BCVTB to concatenate the data
into one vector,

.         pass the concatenated vector to EnergyPlus.

 

Hope that helps.

Thanks!

Exactly! Do you know if this is possible? I wanted to know if energyplus can
get data from two different simulators.

 

Another question I have been trying is: can I run one energyplus simulator
faster than the other? Lets say you have one energyplus running, but for
every time time step t you have another energyplus that runs 3t. I want to
see the future before it happens in the other one. 

 

I tried to use for example the iterateoverarray actor but it does not work
because they are not synchronised......another idea is to use a different
director instead of the SDF to use the PN but it also didn't work because
bcvtb seems not to accept it, I changed the SystemVariables properties but
didn't work, do have any idea how this could be done?

 

Thanks!

Hi Thierry,

 

do you know if there is a way to connect more than one componet to
energyplus, for example to connect ptolemy and another simulator to exchange
data with it at the same time?

 

Thanks!

We are pleased to announce the release of the Building Controls Virtual Test
Bed 1.3.

 

The following changes have been made compared to version 1.2:

 

* TRNSYS  has been added as a client program.

* The Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation import interface has
been added.

* The example files have been updated for EnergyPlus 8.0. 

 

The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) is a freely available
open-source software environment that allows expert users to couple
different simulation programs for co-simulation, 

and to couple simulation programs with actual hardware. For example, the
BCVTB allows to simulate a building in EnergyPlus and the HVAC and control
system in Modelica, 

while exchanging data between the software as they simulate. The BCVTB is
based on the Ptolemy II software environment. 

The BCVTB allows expert users of simulation to expand the capabilities of
individual programs by linking them to other programs. 

Due to the different programs that may be involved in distributed
simulation, familiarity with configuring programs is essential.

 

Programs that are linked to the BCVTB are

 

* the EnergyPlus whole building energy simulation program,

* the Modelica modeling and simulation environment Dymola,

* the MATLAB and Simulink tools for scientific computing,

* the Radiance ray-tracing software for lighting analysis,

* the ESP-r integrated building energy modeling program,

* the TRNSYS system simulation program, 

* Functional Mock-up Units (FMU) for co-simulation,

* the BACnet stack, which allows exchanging data with BACnet compliant
Building Automation System (BAS),

* the analog/digital interface USB-1208LS from Measurement Computing
Corporation that can be connected to a USB port. 

 

In addition to using programs that are coupled to Ptolemy II, Ptolemy II's
graphical modeling environment can also be used to define models for control
systems, for physical devices, 

for communication systems or for post-processing and real-time
visualization.

Hi,
I've created a detailed multi-zone model of a low energy home in Canada in EnergyPlus. I am looking at the peak heating load results and finding that the infiltration predicted seems quite high. I'd be interested to hear how other building modellers are approaching infiltration, and any general thoughts anyone has on this situation.
The model is based on the design - the house has not been constructed yet, but it is assumed that an ACH at 50pa rating of 1 can be achieved. EnergyPlus has a simple infiltration modelling option, where the air leakage can be input as ACH@ regular pressure (I've assumed this is equal to 1/20 = 0.05).
EnergyPlus's basic infiltration model can adjust the infiltration rate for delta T and windspeed, using the following formula:
Infiltration = I_design * {A + B (T_zone - T_outdoor) + C*windspeed + D*windspeed^2 } The big question I have is what coefficients should be used? EPlus provides three suggestions: 
1. coefficients from BLAST:
A =     0.606,                   !- Constant Term CoefficientB =     0.03636,                 !- Temperature Term CoefficientC =    0.1177,                  !- Velocity Term CoefficientD =    0;                       !- Velocity Squared Term Coefficient
2. coeffs from DOE: 0, 0, 0.224 (windpeed), 0
3.Default: 1,0,0,0 which means a constant ACH with no modification.
The BLAST coefficients seemed to be the best to me because I think wind and temperature difference should be accounted for and there should always be some basic infiltration. However, using these coefficients at the peak heating load condition (delta T ~ 40C, windpeed = 27 km/hr) the infiltration rate is tripled from the base 0.05 ACH, and the total load from infiltration equals 2.2 kW, which is the largest component of the heating load.
For a relatively tight house this seems like an unrealistic value to me, but I do not have much to compare it against.

Thanks,
Hayes

Hi Hayes,

 

The ZoneInfiltration:EffectiveLeakageArea approach in E+ might give you
better results as it is tailored for residential buildings.  It accounts for
stack, wind and sheltering better than the ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate
method, which is used more for larger building models.  

 

Regardless of the method, the bigger problem is the infiltration schedule.
You could start with the schedules they have in eQuest.   The operation of
the HRV will affect the infiltration schedule.  And, on larger buildings, of
course, infiltration in core zones can be set to zero.

 

On a 600m3 house, ACH50 = 1.0 is roughly 166 L/s.  This is about 55 L/s at
10Pa,  and translates to an effective leakage area of about 0.45 cm/m2.
These are what I would use as design numbers.   From experience, ACH50 = 1.0
(even 1.5) is a challenging target to reach and can't be reached unless you
use a blower door during construction.  

 

Hope this helps,

Shaun

If your going to use the coefficient method you shouldn't use 1/20th of the
ACH50 as the base infiltration. It is supposed to be an average value for
typical exposure etc. You could use the BLAST eqn but you will need to
adjust the inputs. I'd suggest looking at the pressure drop across the
house at the peak wind condition and see what the Pa difference is across
the windward and leeward walls. Assume a linear drop with pressure from
your ACH50 value and pull out the "basic infiltration" from that.

I agree that 1ACH at 50Pa is challenging with standard practice construction.
The average new home in NZ without anything special is about
6ACH at 50Pa.That said, two weeks ago, I witnessed a blower door test of
a passive house
(1st time builder) that was less than 0.3ACH at 50Pa the first time we turned
on the blower door. This was the first time this builder had attempted an
"airtight" house - after fixing a few oversights it was at
0.26ACH at 50Pa.The structure was designed to be sealed properly and he
used ProClima's
tapes and membranes. If you build  a SIP house it is also likely to be
under 1ACH50 without trying too hard.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling Infiltration for Low Energy Houses
Hi,

I've created a detailed multi-zone model of a low energy home in Canada in
EnergyPlus. I am looking at the peak heating load results and finding that
the infiltration predicted seems quite high. I'd be interested to hear how
other building modellers are approaching infiltration, and any general
thoughts anyone has on this situation.

The model is based on the design - the house has not been constructed yet,
but it is assumed that an ACH at 50pa rating of 1 can be achieved. EnergyPlus
has a simple infiltration modelling option, where the air leakage can be
input as ACH@ regular pressure (I've assumed this is equal to 1/20 = 0.05).

EnergyPlus's basic infiltration model can adjust the infiltration rate for
delta T and windspeed, using the following formula:

Infiltration = I_design * {A + B (T_zone - T_outdoor) + C*windspeed +
D*windspeed^2 }****

** **

The big question I have is what coefficients should be used? EPlus provides
three suggestions:


1. coefficients from BLAST:


A =     0.606,                   !- Constant Term Coefficient****

B =     0.03636,                 !- Temperature Term Coefficient****

C =    0.1177,                  !- Velocity Term Coefficient****

D =    0;                       !- Velocity Squared Term Coefficient


2. coeffs from DOE: 0, 0, 0.224 (windpeed), 0


3.Default: 1,0,0,0 which means a constant ACH with no modification.


The BLAST coefficients seemed to be the best to me because I think wind and
temperature difference should be accounted for and there should always be
some basic infiltration. However, using these coefficients at the peak
heating load condition (delta T ~ 40C, windpeed = 27 km/hr) the
infiltration rate is tripled from the base 0.05 ACH, and the total load
from infiltration equals 2.2 kW, which is the largest component of the
heating load.


For a relatively tight house this seems like an unrealistic value to me,
but I do not have much to compare it against.



Thanks,


Hayes

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Modelling Infiltration for Low Energy Houses

Hi Hayes,****

** **

The ZoneInfiltration:EffectiveLeakageArea approach in E+ might give you
better results as it is tailored for residential buildings.  It accounts
for stack, wind and sheltering better than the
ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate method, which is used more for larger
building models.  ****

** **

Regardless of the method, the bigger problem is the infiltration schedule.
You could start with the schedules they have in eQuest.   The operation of
the HRV will affect the infiltration schedule.  And, on larger buildings,
of course, infiltration in core zones can be set to zero.****

** **

On a 600m3 house, ACH50 = 1.0 is roughly 166 L/s.  This is about 55 L/s at
10Pa,  and translates to an effective leakage area of about 0.45 cm/m2.
These are what I would use as design numbers.   From experience, ACH50 =
1.0 (even 1.5) is a challenging target to reach and can?t be reached unless
you use a blower door during construction.  ****

** **

Hope this helps,****

Shaun****

Hi, Bill - I had this situation once, and I rotated the baseline and submitted it. I got the following comment:

Table 1.8.1 and Table 1.8.1(b) of the template include the simulation results for the 90-degree, 180-degree, and 270-degree Baseline model rotations; however, since this project is an addition to an existing project, the Baseline model must not be simulated for the different rotations. Revise Table 1.8.1 and Table 1.8.1(b) by excluding the results for the 90-degree, 180-degree, and 270-degree Baseline model rotations.

Thanks Jim, Stormy.

The project doesn't seem to meet the definition/intent of "addition". It has independent MEP systems and it doesn't share any structural elements with the two other dorms that it is connected to. It just has doors in the stairwells that allow access to the central corridors of the adjacent two dorms.

Nevertheless, I will skip the baseline rotations and let the LEED Reviewer tell me otherwise.

Just to toss a slightly different experience into the hat:

I recently had a grouping of 3 LEED projects (new building footprint was minimal) sharing the following identical comment language:

"Note that only projects that are greater than 50% new construction are required to simulate all four rotations. Please revise the energy model as required and report only the zero degree rotation in Table EAp2-4."

I think this is a LEED-specific line in the sand, but my takeaway is that buildings which are largely new construction (by >50%) are expected to be rotated for the baseline.

For these recent models, this direction had negligible effect on the documented performance, but I was able to save some fraction of time/effort for the second round of documentation.

Having experienced this, it was a pretty painless fix - I wish all LEED review commentary were this easy!  If I were at all unsure on this issue at the first submittal, prior to review commentary, I might just plan on doing the rotations anyway as it's a pretty easy thing to untick the parametric runs and assemble less documentation if it comes up (under eQuest/DOE2).

If you have some weeks prior to your submission deadline, I've heard that contacting GBCI's technical staff directly by email has worked well for others:  http://www.gbci.org/contactcertification.aspx  This isn't the same thing as a formal CIR (it's free), and I understand they'll tell you plainly if your clarification needs to be submitted as a formal CIR for the project.  If you should pursue this option, let us know how it turns out!

Regards,

~Nick

Thanks Jim, Stormy.

The project doesn't seem to meet the definition/intent of "addition". It has independent MEP systems and it doesn't share any structural elements with the two other dorms that it is connected to. It just has doors in the stairwells that allow access to the central corridors of the adjacent two dorms.

Nevertheless, I will skip the baseline rotations and let the LEED Reviewer tell me otherwise.

Hi, Bill - I had this situation once, and I rotated the baseline and submitted it. I got the following comment:

Table 1.8.1 and Table 1.8.1(b) of the template include the simulation results for the 90-degree, 180-degree, and 270-degree Baseline model rotations; however, since this project is an addition to an existing project, the Baseline model must not be simulated for the different rotations. Revise Table 1.8.1 and Table 1.8.1(b) by excluding the results for the 90-degree, 180-degree, and 270-degree Baseline model rotations.

Like Nick said, this was probably one of the easiest ever revisions to a model as a result of reviewer comments. For a little more background on the project for which I got the review comment below, it was a LEED NC project, and the LEED project boundary included only new construction. The new building was constructed up against an existing building and there was a door between the two buildings for access. The new building had independent MEP systems and structure. One entire face of my building had adiabatic "exterior" walls (those that were shared with the existing building). Therefore, rotating the building was kind of a silly exercise because those adiabatic walls could never have been on any other orientation of the building in real life... not that Appendix G doesn't make us model unrealistic things all the time, but I figure that was the reviewer's rationale.

I have had success getting questions answered by reviewers through the "contact us" feature on LEED Online. I haven't used that option until the final review stage, though, when a disagreement would have resulted in an appeal.

Hi Vikram,

My gut reaction would be to determine (or preferably get others to determine) what an annual temperature profile would look like for the... effluent.  Get the same person to inform you of whatever special considerations should be given to pumping energies and heat exchanging elements.

Transpose that information onto a lake/well heat exchanger, and go to town!

Worth noting however, I have had mixed hurdles in the past when working with water-to-water heat exchangers.  Some projects were smooth/easy and others were tougher to set up properly - it would probably be advisable to play with setting your hydronic systems up early (with default inputs as needed) just to be sure you will have a working game plan once all the information you plan to receive is available.  This exercise may help uncover some other information you need to seek out along the way.

Regards,

~Nick

Our company looked at this years ago (before I joined them) as an alternative to cooling towers.  As I understand we had to ditch it as the water authority was changing their infrastructure and moving sewer pumping stations which was the nail in the coffin.  However that aside the variability of flows and the fact that they are not guaranteed was a big barrier.  We would still have had to have a backup heat rejection source...  There has also been a huge move towards water efficiency in Australia (driest continent next to Antarctica) in the past 15+ years and recycled water plants are more common in precinct and larger buildings.  So liquor flows are on the decline with all else equal.  Just became more work and uncertainty than it was worth...  Your situation may be different ?

Graham

Some projects were smooth/easy and others were tougher to set up properly ? it would probably be advisable to play with setting your hydronic systems up early (with default inputs as needed) just to be sure you will have a working game plan once all the information you plan to receive is available.  This exercise may help uncover some other information you need to seek out along the way.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Purchased Chilled Water Systems for DES LEED Modeling
Message-ID: <CAMdiMCLrX31sxpOMg16N+UN9mYAZMU=eNGjF=nHkUwKhH1TFAg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi BLDG-SIM Users,
We are working on a new LEED Office/Retail Project that intends to use the
Existing District Cooling System (Cooling Towers) for cooling. The proposed
building will have water cooled self contained units rejecting the heat to
the condenser water from the District Cooling Towers.

Based on the document from USGBC "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal
Energy in LEED 2009", we are looking into modeling this as Option 1 -
Building Stand Alone Scenario, where we disregard all the upstream
equipment energy. In the proposed building, this only constitutes for the
HEAT REJECTION on the towers.

However, our system type in Baseline comes out to be System 6 which is
changed to System 8 using the Table 3 in LEED Manual mentioned earlier.
System 8 is VAV with Reheat with cooling energy associated with Chillers
and Cooling towers. Also, we are to disregard the Purchased Cooling from
both baseline and proposed to keep the model DES neutral.

1. Does Chillers, Chilled Water Pumps, Condenser Water Pumps, and Cooling
Towers modeled in the Baseline need to be all considered as part of the
Purchased cooling and thus excluded from the Savings calculations?
2. If we have a Condenser water booster pump for the new building in the
proposed building, should we also model a condenser water pump for the new
building at 19 W/GPM (ASHRAE 90.1)  for baseline and include both of them
as part of the downstream equipment energy?

Your help is very appreciated.

Thanks and we look forward to your suggestions.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed 1.3 has been
	released
Message-ID: <012d01ce4761$59d90e00$0d8b2a00$@gov>

We are pleased to announce the release of the Building Controls Virtual Test
Bed 1.3.

 

The following changes have been made compared to version 1.2:

 

* TRNSYS  has been added as a client program.

* The Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation import interface has
been added.

* The example files have been updated for EnergyPlus 8.0. 

 

The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) is a freely available
open-source software environment that allows expert users to couple
different simulation programs for co-simulation, 

and to couple simulation programs with actual hardware. For example, the
BCVTB allows to simulate a building in EnergyPlus and the HVAC and control
system in Modelica, 

while exchanging data between the software as they simulate. The BCVTB is
based on the Ptolemy II software environment. 

The BCVTB allows expert users of simulation to expand the capabilities of
individual programs by linking them to other programs. 

Due to the different programs that may be involved in distributed
simulation, familiarity with configuring programs is essential.

 

Programs that are linked to the BCVTB are

 

* the EnergyPlus whole building energy simulation program,

* the Modelica modeling and simulation environment Dymola,

* the MATLAB and Simulink tools for scientific computing,

* the Radiance ray-tracing software for lighting analysis,

* the ESP-r integrated building energy modeling program,

* the TRNSYS system simulation program, 

* Functional Mock-up Units (FMU) for co-simulation,

* the BACnet stack, which allows exchanging data with BACnet compliant
Building Automation System (BAS),

* the analog/digital interface USB-1208LS from Measurement Computing
Corporation that can be connected to a USB port. 

 

In addition to using programs that are coupled to Ptolemy II, Ptolemy II's
graphical modeling environment can also be used to define models for control
systems, for physical devices, 

for communication systems or for post-processing and real-time
visualization.

Dear all,

For a LEED EAp2/EAc1 energy model, does the following above-grade wall
situation fall under a mass wall or a steel-framed wall in the baseline?

8" CMU wall (load bearing) with steel studs to the interior just to create
a cavity for the batt insulation etc.

Ramana,

 

Per Table G3.1 section 5b, the baseline is always a steel-framed wall
for Appendix G modeling. So you get to take credit for additional
thermal mass.

Thanks for the update Thierry!

I've tried the TRNSYS example, but could not get it to work since I don't
have the DLLs for the new TRNSYS Type 6666 and Type 6667 used by the
example.
I could not find the DLLs anywhere in the BCVTB install directory. Should I
download them from somewhere else?

To round out the topic:  Outside the context of LEED/Appendix G modeling (if you're concerned with prescriptive compliance), the threshold of what constitutes a mass wall is based on heat capacity (thermal mass), defined further in the 90.1 definitions.

I once looked hard at the issue and came away with this easy rule of thumb: any wall construction including a course of standard 4" brick exceeds the threshold and can be considered a mass wall.  I would expect pretty much any wall including CMU to follow suit, filled or not.

Ramana,

Per Table G3.1 section 5b, the baseline is always a steel-framed wall for Appendix G modeling. So you get to take credit for additional thermal mass.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Per 90.1, mass wall or steel-framed wall?

Dear all,

For a LEED EAp2/EAc1 energy model, does the following above-grade wall situation fall under a mass wall or a steel-framed wall in the baseline?

8" CMU wall (load bearing) with steel studs to the interior just to create a cavity for the batt insulation etc.

Thanks,
Ramana Koti.

Bldg-Simers -

As we all strive to coalesce and concentrate resources on energy modeling,
we are happy to announce the launch of a website designed to support our
local users group here in Boise, Idaho.

https://sites.google.com/site/idlbsug/home

However, the site has lots of modeling resources available to everybody
including:

-  calculation spreadsheets developed by our lab and others (
https://sites.google.com/site/idlbsug/modeling-resources/calculation-spreadsheets
)
-  a current draft of our ongoing living document of modeling protocols and
procedures (
https://sites.google.com/site/idlbsug/modeling-resources/ui-idl-simulation-protocols-draft
)
-  a video archive of our groups presentations, most recently posted is a
talk from Chris Baker of the Weidt Group on integrating energy modeling
early and often throughout the design process (
https://sites.google.com/site/idlbsug/video-archive)

Enjoy! Any feedback is welcome!

Cheers,

Hi Max

Nice job compiling this. I would also add climate consultant, a free software developed at UCLA that has a sun shading chart in which you can use epw files to design your shading system as a function of outdoor temperature and solar geometry.

Although these have EnergyPlus input files, check out the Secondary School -  there's a spreadsheet with each building (in the Version 1.3_5.0 updated 9/27/10 .ZIPs, RefBldgSecondarySchoolNew2004_v1.3_5.0_SI.xls) with all the schedules documented.  The next version (1.4_7.2) is just an update of EnergyPlus versions.

Hi Amit,

As per the guidance for district or campus thermal energy in LEED mentioned
that:

*"In Option 1, the energy model?s scope accounts for only downstream
equipment. *This scenario is modeled in accordance with ASHRAE 90.1
Appendix G requirements with the following exceptions:



   - The energy source is modeled as purchased energy in both the Proposed
   and Baseline buildings for all air handlers, fan-coil units, and other
   downstream equipment serviced by district or campus energy systems .....


   - Where necessary, building Baseline HVAC system types from Tables
   G3.1.A and G3.1.B are modified to be consistent with the purchased energy
   source (Table 3) .... "


So, only downstream equipment shall be modeled in both the proposed and
baseline buildings and Chillers, Chilled Water Pumps, Condenser Water
Pumps, and Cooling Towers (upstream equipment) shall NOT be modeled in
option 1.

If the condenser water pump is part of the LEED building and downstream to
DES, shall be modeled as per ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G. If CW pump upstream of
the building even it's a bosster shall not be modeled and considered as a
part of DES.


Hope that help!

Dear colleagues:

As in previous years, we will be offering a three day Executive Education program on Daylighting Buildings<http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/programs/daylighting-buildings-1> at Harvard from July 10-12 2013.

Course participants will acquire a range of daylighting design analysis techniques ranging from rules of thumb to state-of-the-art computer simulations and high dynamic range photography for glare analysis. The main simulation program used will be DIVA<http://diva4rhino.com/>, a Rhino plug-in that supports the calculation of daylight availability (DAYSIM), annual daylight glare probability maps (Evalglare), thermal load calculations (EnergyPlus) and radiation maps (GenCumulativeSky). The assumptions underlying these programs will be discussed in detail.

The first two days will consist of formal instructions, in-class discussions, hands-on software tutorials, and exercises. Participants will also be given the opportunity to calibrate their personal digital cameras to take HDR images and learn several ways to quantitatively evaluate these images. During the last day, participants will be given the opportunity to apply the newly acquired analysis techniques to ongoing projects of their own.

If you want to make this your "daylighting week" you could further join us on the following Monday, July 15, for DIVA DAY in New York. (Details to follow.)

Best,

Christoph

Subject: [Bldg-sim] White Box Technologies launches Web-based weather data
 for building energy simulations
Message-ID: <518CAA45.202@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

(please excuse any cross-postings)

White Box Technologies is pleased to announce the launch of *WBT Weather Data for Energy 
Calculations*, a web site providing instant Web access to typical year and historical year 
weather files for thousands of locations around the world created from recorded weather 
data going back as far as 30 years to as recent as the past week.  This website has been 
created by a long-time building energy modeler with several decades' experience in 
processing weather data for use in building energy simulations.

For typical year data, this Web site features ASHRAE's *IWEC2 weather files for 3,012 
international locations*, as well as TMY3, CWEC2, and CZ2010 weather files for US, 
Canadian, and California locations, respectively.  IWEC2 weather files cost $35 each, the 
other sets are public data hosted with permission and are free.

For historical data, this Web site contains *weather files from 2007 to 2012 for over 
10,000 locations around the world, including over 1,500 in the US and 300 in Canada*. 
Older weather files going back to 1980 are also available and can be be generated on 
request. The historical weather files have been processed by WBT and cost $50 each. A 
typical year weather file can also be produced on request for any location with 7 or more 
years of historical data.

All weather files are provided in two formats: *.BINM for use in DOE-2-derived programs 
and *.EPW for use in EnergyPlus-derived programs, including the DDY file. The IWEC2 files 
also contain an archival *.CSV format, and the historical files an archival *.FIN4 
format.  Discount prices for large orders and subscriptions are also available.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Baseline VAV OA vs Proposed DOAS OA
Message-ID: <DUB103-W57DD6BAEA58C5BC2978DF0E0A50@phx.gbl>

Hi all,

I'm looking for guidance on which number to use for my baseline OA when compared to the proposed system.

The proposed HVAC system is DOAS - FCUs. OA requirements according to ASHRAE 62.1 are 10,216 cfm. However, to satisfy exhaust requirements, the total system ventilation, i.e. OA as it's a DOAS, is 13,160 cfm.

Does the baseline OA need to equal 10,216 or 13,160 cfm?

Thanks

In my opinion, the baseline case OA should be equal to the proposed OA. OA required by 62.1 is only a basis for reference.

Hi Donal,

As OA in the proposed model must equal the OA in the baseline model so you
have to use 13,160 CFM (better energy saving chance on the proposed than
10,216 CFM).

There are more details on Example 6-III "Calculation of Fan Power Energy,
Floor-by-Floor System" at ASHRAE 90.1-2007 User's Manual

From: wahid.hamed at gmail.com
To: oconnor_dj at hotmail.com
CC: bldg-sim at lists.onebuilding.org

Hi Donal, As OA in the proposed model must equal the OA in the baseline model so you have to use 13,160 CFM (better energy saving chance on the proposed than 10,216 CFM).
 There are more details on Example 6-III "Calculation of Fan Power Energy, Floor-by-Floor System" at ASHRAE 90.1-2007 User's Manual 
  
Best Regards,

Hi all,

I'm looking for guidance on which number to use for my baseline OA when compared to the proposed system.

The proposed HVAC system is DOAS - FCUs. OA requirements according to ASHRAE 62.1 are 10,216 cfm. However, to satisfy exhaust requirements, the total system ventilation, i.e. OA as it's a DOAS, is 13,160 cfm.


Does the baseline OA need to equal 10,216 or 13,160 cfm?

Thanks

D?nal

Message-ID: <FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA3226113AAD51@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>

Greetings simulationists, photon wranglers, et al.,

It is my pleasure and an honor to announce the 12th International Radiance Workshop, which will take place August 12-14th 2013 in Golden, CO, USA at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).  The format will be the same as in recent years, with the first day being full of tutorials and software demonstrations, and days two and three reserved for presentations of work you've done with Radiance over the last year.

On day one, we will have Greg Ward presenting on new features/functionality added to the Radiance code since last year's workshop, as well as a primer on BSDFs and their generation with, and use in, Radiance. Andy McNeil may even have a few words about an enhanced daylight coefficient method that Radiance is being adapted to utilize (those kooks at Berkeley decided three phases weren't enough). Jan Weinold (Fraunhofer ISE) will be talking about his glare metric (DGP) and his tool (Evalglare), while a mystery guest from Boise, ID will offer additional perspectives on glare metrics.  Kera Lagios (Solemma LLC / Lam Partners) will be giving a demo on DIVA, and members of NREL's Commercial Buildings Research Goup will be giving a demo on whole building energy simulations with Radiance and EnergyPlus, using the OpenStudio Application Suite and SDK.  

Days two and three are what *you* make of them, really.  Time slots for user presentations will be contingent on how many people we get to come out, but figure about 20 minutes per person. What has Radiance done for you lately? We all want to know/see! 

We will be webcasting the workshop, so if you can't make it out to Colorado, no worries, you can enjoy the proceedings from wherever you are, via the intertubes. We will also be recording the presentations and posting them online for future viewing.

This event will take place on NREL's main campus, in one of our newest buildings, the Research Support Facility (RSF) which is one of the largest net-zero energy facilities in the entire world. Daylighting was a core component of the integrated high-performance building design, and its performance was predicted with Radiance. Come see a real life example of the power of Radiance's predictive capability! We also have a nicely daylit cafeteria parking garage, and a new building (ESIF) housing first of its kind grid-level simulation and physical test facilities, and a rather zippy supercomputer which will be online by the time you all come out here. We'll try and tour as many of these facilities while you're here as well. More on the buildings, here:

http://www.nrel.gov/esi/esif.html
http://www.nrel.gov/sustainable_nrel/buildings_garage.html
http://www.nrel.gov/sustainable_nrel/buildings_cafe.html

Lastly, I am happy to announce that there will be no registration fee, for speakers and students. (!) The usual banquet/dinner will be an out of pocket expense, but hey, registration is free, so quit complaining. Seriously, we'll find a place that can feed us all and we'll have a good time and make inspiring speeches. 

We will be posting a web page with all this info and more, but I wanted to get the word out so you can mark your calendars and start planning. Oh, and to that end, NREL is located in Golden, CO, USA, which is about 15 miles west of Denver. If you're flying in, you'd want to fly into Denver International (KDEN). More on getting here, here:
http://www.nrel.gov/about/golden.html

More on staying here, here:
http://www.nrel.gov/about/golden_info.html

Since there is no registration fee, registration is simple. Send an email to me (robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov).  If you are a foreign national, there is extra paperwork we need to do. If you are from Iran, Syria, Cuba, or , unfortunately you will not be able to attend in person. However, since we are webcasting the event, we will be able to support those of you from these countries who cannot attend in person by allowing you to present via webex. Please let me know ASAP if you will need this option.

Please do the following, ASAP:
- Email me your intent to participate in Golden: 
- Please indicate your citizenship status. 
- Please indicate whether you're coming for day one, two, three or some combination thereof.
- Please submit a brief abstract on your presentation.

Thanks for reading, and we're looking forward to seeing you all in beautiful Colorado in a few months!

Presentation 1
A demonstration of AECOSim Energy Simulator, the latest GUI for EnergyPlus
Drury B. Crawley, Director, Building Performance, Bentley Systems, Inc.
Description: AECOsim Energy Simulator (AES) is a full-featured, graphic interface for building performance simulation built from the ground up based on the latest EnergyPlus (v7.2) simulation engine.  AES was initially released by Bentley Systems in September 2011.  This demonstration will first cover the interface including the ribbon bar; tree for navigating spaces, walls, windows, doors, ceilings, roofs, internal loads, HVAC components, and zoning; BIM interface to visualize building models.  How to create an AES building model will also be shown: Conceptual Design (13 inputs, sketch the building outline, select HVAC system); import 2-D CAD and trace the building and spaces; import gbXML; or import graphics (bitmap, JPEG, GIF, PDF) and trace spaces.
Then, the HVAC Designer will be shown along with 31 preconfigured HVAC and SWH systems (preconfigured systems automatically create the all the necessary EnergyPlus nodes, branches, and connections). The HVAC Designer makes it easy to configure the more than 50 HVAC Designer components and create or modify systems using a visual drag and drop system. Finally, automated creation of baseline and budget buildings for ASHRAE 90.1 will be shown as well as results from ASHRAE RTS/heat loss and EnergyPlus simulation.
About the Speaker:  Dr. Crawley leads the team developing a new generation of building performance software for energy and sustainability at Bentley Systems, including AECOsim Energy Simulator, among others (Open Plant with HVAC, Hevacomp Simulator, Hevacomp Mechanical Designer, and Hevacomp Electrical Designer). (AECOsim Energy Simulator is a BIM-based, full featured graphic interface for the U.S. Department of Energy flagship EnergyPlus building simulation program.)
With more than 30 years of experience in buildings energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainability, he has worked in engineering software development, government research and standards development organizations, as well as building design and energy consulting companies. Prior to joining Bentley in early 2010, he managed the U.S. Department of Energy's building energy software tools research and development including EnergyPlus, OpenStudio plugin for Google (now Trimble) SketchUp, Energy-10, and DOE-2. He also led DOE's Commercial Building Initiative - working to achieve cost-effective low-energy commercial buildings, including the Commercial Building Energy Alliances and Commercial Building Partnerships which included the owners of more than 20% of the commercial building floor space.

	"Buildings" library
Message-ID: <CACXXVcj=k6vPUaT9UdWmb5hiSQTekOi1RoAgnaTKUVHPEgygVA@mail.gmail.com>

LBNL releases version 1.4 build 1 of the Modelica "Buildings" library and
version 1.2.0 of the "BuildingsPy" Python package.

In Buildings 1.4 build 1, models for heat conduction in phase change
materials have been included. New in this version is also an interface that
allows calling Python from a Modelica function. Various issues have been
fixed and models have been changed to conform with the Modelica Language
Specification. This has been done to increase compatibility with
OpenModelica, which is work in progress.

For a detailed list of changes, see
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/v1.4_build1/help/Buildings_UsersGuide_ReleaseNotes.html

In BuildingsPy 1.2.0, stricter tests for running the unit tests have been
implemented. The unit tests now check for better conformance with the
Modelica Language Specification.

The development of the Buildings library and of BuildingsPy has been moved
from subversion to github. The development pages are
https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings
and
https://github.com/lbl-srg/BuildingsPy
This has been done to facilitate collaborative developments.

Message-ID: <CAN1ZnDt6FsrvKaQKVjhq-kMJfsR6A9PaBS8m7J-FQgpacN3bvg@mail.gmail.com>

Good afternoon Energy Modelers!

Join us *Tuesday, May 21* for the next meeting of the Rocky Mountain Energy
Simulation Engineers (RMESE). *Ellen Franconi from Rocky Mountain
Institute*will be our guest speaker for the evening.

Ellen will talk about topics touched on in her recent RMI blog post - "Show
Me The Money: Boosting Investor Confidence Through Better Building Energy
Efficiency Modeling."  The context for the discussion is summarized below.
Her blog was picked up by the Environmental Defense Fund Investor
Confidence Project, which can be found at http://www.eeperformance.org/.



Today?s interest in energy efficiency is perhaps the strongest it has ever
been. To capitalize on the investment potential, the risk associated with
retrofit energy savings estimates need to be identified. Project savings
risk can be partially addressed through uncertainty analysis, modeler
credentialing, and establishing modeling process requirements. Continued
progress in these areas will help energy projects be considered alongside
traditional investments. Coupling these advancements with new financing
mechanisms that target outcome-based performance provides the levers needed
to realize retrofit building investment opportunities. The approach offers
a winning triple play that will provide business profit, new U.S. jobs, and
environmental benefits. To realize its benefits will required energy
modelers to expand their role and rethink the way their work is presented.
Specifically, energy modelers will need to account for direct and indirect
benefits and risks associated with energy project performance improvements.

We will be meeting at *The RMH Group?s office in Lakewood at 6:00 pm
Tuesday, May 21 *for* *a short presentation, appetizers, and drinks. There
will be a $10 / person fee to cover the cost of the food and drinks.

The RMH Group is located roughly 1 mile east of NREL at:

The RMH Group, Inc.

12600 W Colfax Avenue

Suite A-260

Lakewood, CO 80215

Please RSVP to Jessie Jones at jjones at rmhgroup.com or (303)312-4641 so that
we can prepare enough food and beverages. This is not invite only- so pass
the word on to coworkers, colleagues, and other industry professionals who
may be interested.

Thank you,
*RMESE Steering Committee*

Hi All,

I want to retrieve data from a child component/s. Does anyone know whether referencing child data in eQuest is supported? It seems that none of the child data functions are recognized by eQuest (e.g., parent functions are working). For instance:
ChildCount(EXTERIOR-WALL)
ChildRef( EXTERIOR-WALL:KEYWORD, 1 )

I?m 99% confident that it?s not possible to ref child components in eQuest.

Hi All,

I want to retrieve data from a child component/s. Does anyone know whether referencing child data in eQuest is supported? It seems that none of the child data functions are recognized by eQuest (e.g., parent functions are working). For instance:
ChildCount(EXTERIOR-WALL)
ChildRef( EXTERIOR-WALL:KEYWORD, 1 )
SumChildren()
etc.

Thanks,
Norbert

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Fwd: White Box Technologies launches Web-based weather
 data for building energy simulations (repost)
Message-ID: <5196789D.3000106@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

  (reposted with corrections.  I've received a few e-mails stating either the links or the 
GoogleEarth ap did not work.  If that happens, please let me know via e-mail.  Thanks.)

(please excuse the cross-postings)

White Box Technologies is pleased to announce under agreement with ASHRAE the launch of 
*WBT Weather Data for Energy Calculations,* a web site providing instant access to typical 
year and historical year weather files for thousands of locations around the world.  The 
data are created from recorded weather data going back as far as 30 years to as recent as 
the past week.

For typical year weather data, the web site features *ASHRAE's IWEC2 weather files for 
3,012 international locations*, as well as TMY3, CWEC2, and CZ2010 weather files for US, 
Canadian, and California locations, respectively.  IWEC2 weather files cost $35 each, the 
other sets are public data hosted with permission and provided free of charge.

For historical weather data, this Web site features *weather files from 2007 to 2012 for 
over 10,000 locations around the world, including over 1,500 US and 300 Canadian 
locations.* Older weather files going back to 1980 are also available and can be generated 
on request. The historical weather files have been processed by WBT and cost $50 each.  
Typical year weather files can also be produced on request for any location with 7 or more 
years of historical data.

All weather files are provided in two formats: *.BINM for use in DOE-2-derived programs 
and *.EPW for use in EnergyPlus-derived programs, including the DDY file. The IWEC2 files 
also contain an archival *.CSV format, and the historical files an archival *.FIN4 
format.  Discount prices for large orders and subscriptions are also available.

ASHRAE's IWEC2 files are made possible through ASHRAE Research funding.  The WBT Weather 
Data for Energy Calculations web site  has been created by a long-time building energy 
modeler with several decades' experience in processing weather data for use in building 
energy simulations.

Hi All,


I have a question regarding EnergyPlus HVAC system modeling:

How to model a 2 pipe FCU/UV in EnergyPlus because it seems to require that
I specify a cooling coil name which I don't have (I don't have a cooling
plant)?

Thanks!

Hi Qinpeng,

Cooling coil availability schedule can be used to make it unavailable.

 From E+ IO Reference

Fan coil units can be 4-pipe or 2-pipe. For 4-pipe units there are 2 
supply pipes and 2 return
pipes. For 2-pipe units there is a single supply pipe and a single 
return pipe and the supply is
switched between hot and chilled water depending on the season. We model 
4-pipe units, but
the 4-pipe model can be used to model 2-pipe units by using the coil 
availability schedules to
make sure that either hot or chilled water is exclusively available.

Thanks,
Chandan

For a heating-only unit, you can use the unit heater or unit ventilator 
instead of the fan coil.

Greetings simulationists, apologies for the cross postings, yadda yadda,

The 2013 edition of the International Radiance Workshop will take place August 12-14 at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), in Golden, CO, USA. This annual event is a gathering of Radiance practicioners -- lighting designers, engineers, architects, software developers, researchers, artists, students, and educators -- where we show off our work with the lighting simulation tool known as Radiance (and the many that use Radiance). 

For those interested in attending the workshop (in person or via webcast), please visit the following url for details:

http://www.nrel.gov/buildings/2013_radiance_workshop.html

I hope to see you in Colorado this August!

- Rob

I don't fully understand this use case. Do you want for instance to connect
two simulators (e.g. TRNSYS and Dymola) to one instance of EnergyPlus?

Thanks!

Thierry

Hi Thierry,

 

do you know if there is a way to connect more than one componet to
energyplus, for example to connect ptolemy and another simulator to exchange
data with it at the same time?

 

Thanks!

We are pleased to announce the release of the Building Controls Virtual Test
Bed 1.3.

 

The following changes have been made compared to version 1.2:

 

* TRNSYS  has been added as a client program.

* The Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation import interface has
been added.

* The example files have been updated for EnergyPlus 8.0. 

 

The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) is a freely available
open-source software environment that allows expert users to couple
different simulation programs for co-simulation, 

and to couple simulation programs with actual hardware. For example, the
BCVTB allows to simulate a building in EnergyPlus and the HVAC and control
system in Modelica, 

while exchanging data between the software as they simulate. The BCVTB is
based on the Ptolemy II software environment. 

The BCVTB allows expert users of simulation to expand the capabilities of
individual programs by linking them to other programs. 

Due to the different programs that may be involved in distributed
simulation, familiarity with configuring programs is essential.

 

Programs that are linked to the BCVTB are

 

* the EnergyPlus whole building energy simulation program,

* the Modelica modeling and simulation environment Dymola,

* the MATLAB and Simulink tools for scientific computing,

* the Radiance ray-tracing software for lighting analysis,

* the ESP-r integrated building energy modeling program,

* the TRNSYS system simulation program, 

* Functional Mock-up Units (FMU) for co-simulation,

* the BACnet stack, which allows exchanging data with BACnet compliant
Building Automation System (BAS),

* the analog/digital interface USB-1208LS from Measurement Computing
Corporation that can be connected to a USB port. 

 

In addition to using programs that are coupled to Ptolemy II, Ptolemy II's
graphical modeling environment can also be used to define models for control
systems, for physical devices, 

for communication systems or for post-processing and real-time
visualization.

Hello All,
I am using the energy plus software for simulating a building model at
Barcelona,Spain. For this, I am facing the problem of repetitive warning-
** Warning ** CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed "C4 AHU COOLING
COIL" - Full load outlet air dry-bulb temperature < 2C.
This indicates the possibility of coil frost/freeze. Outlet temperature =
1.13 C.
   **   ~~~   **  ...Occurrence info = BAR? VIVER, 01/04 17:07 - 17:10
   **   ~~~   ** ... Possible reasons for low outlet air dry-bulb
temperatures are: This DX coil
   **   ~~~   **    1) may have a low inlet air dry-bulb temperature. Inlet
air temperature = 18.533 C.
   **   ~~~   **    2) may have a low air flow rate per watt of cooling
capacity. Check inputs.
   **   ~~~   **    3) is used as part of a HX assisted cooling coil which
uses a high sensible effectiveness. Check inputs.

*************  ** Warning ** CalcDoe2DXCoil:
Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed="C4 AHU COOLING COIL" - Full load outlet

   *************  **   ~~~   **   during Sizing 0 times.
   *************  **   ~~~   **   Max=1.996617  Min=-1.058986


The above mentioned problem is occurring many time and I have checked all
the parameters related to Cooling Coil but it is not solved.

Please suggest our comments...

Note: EnergyPlus receives a vector as input in the BCVTB.

Let's assume (for your first problem) you would like EnergyPlus to get data
from simulators A and B. 

One way to do could be: 

.         compute in simulator A the data you would like to input to
EnergyPlus,

.         compute in simulator B the data you would like to input to
EnergyPlus,

.         use the VectorAssembler actor in BCVTB to concatenate the data
into one vector,

.         pass the concatenated vector to EnergyPlus.

 

Hope that helps.

Thanks!

 

Thierry

Exactly! Do you know if this is possible? I wanted to know if energyplus can
get data from two different simulators.

 

Another question I have been trying is: can I run one energyplus simulator
faster than the other? Lets say you have one energyplus running, but for
every time time step t you have another energyplus that runs 3t. I want to
see the future before it happens in the other one. 

 

I tried to use for example the iterateoverarray actor but it does not work
because they are not synchronised......another idea is to use a different
director instead of the SDF to use the PN but it also didn't work because
bcvtb seems not to accept it, I changed the SystemVariables properties but
didn't work, do have any idea how this could be done?

 

Thanks!

Hi,
I've created a detailed multi-zone model of a low energy home in Canada in EnergyPlus. I am looking at the peak heating load results and finding that the infiltration predicted seems quite high. I'd be interested to hear how other building modellers are approaching infiltration, and any general thoughts anyone has on this situation.
The model is based on the design - the house has not been constructed yet, but it is assumed that an ACH at 50pa rating of 1 can be achieved. EnergyPlus has a simple infiltration modelling option, where the air leakage can be input as ACH@ regular pressure (I've assumed this is equal to 1/20 = 0.05).
EnergyPlus's basic infiltration model can adjust the infiltration rate for delta T and windspeed, using the following formula:
Infiltration = I_design * {A + B (T_zone - T_outdoor) + C*windspeed + D*windspeed^2 } The big question I have is what coefficients should be used? EPlus provides three suggestions: 
1. coefficients from BLAST:
A =     0.606,                   !- Constant Term CoefficientB =     0.03636,                 !- Temperature Term CoefficientC =    0.1177,                  !- Velocity Term CoefficientD =    0;                       !- Velocity Squared Term Coefficient
2. coeffs from DOE: 0, 0, 0.224 (windpeed), 0
3.Default: 1,0,0,0 which means a constant ACH with no modification.
The BLAST coefficients seemed to be the best to me because I think wind and temperature difference should be accounted for and there should always be some basic infiltration. However, using these coefficients at the peak heating load condition (delta T ~ 40C, windpeed = 27 km/hr) the infiltration rate is tripled from the base 0.05 ACH, and the total load from infiltration equals 2.2 kW, which is the largest component of the heating load.
For a relatively tight house this seems like an unrealistic value to me, but I do not have much to compare it against.

Thanks,
Hayes

Hi Hayes,

 

The ZoneInfiltration:EffectiveLeakageArea approach in E+ might give you
better results as it is tailored for residential buildings.  It accounts for
stack, wind and sheltering better than the ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate
method, which is used more for larger building models.  

 

Regardless of the method, the bigger problem is the infiltration schedule.
You could start with the schedules they have in eQuest.   The operation of
the HRV will affect the infiltration schedule.  And, on larger buildings, of
course, infiltration in core zones can be set to zero.

 

On a 600m3 house, ACH50 = 1.0 is roughly 166 L/s.  This is about 55 L/s at
10Pa,  and translates to an effective leakage area of about 0.45 cm/m2.
These are what I would use as design numbers.   From experience, ACH50 = 1.0
(even 1.5) is a challenging target to reach and can't be reached unless you
use a blower door during construction.  

 

Hope this helps,

Shaun

If your going to use the coefficient method you shouldn't use 1/20th of the
ACH50 as the base infiltration. It is supposed to be an average value for
typical exposure etc. You could use the BLAST eqn but you will need to
adjust the inputs. I'd suggest looking at the pressure drop across the
house at the peak wind condition and see what the Pa difference is across
the windward and leeward walls. Assume a linear drop with pressure from
your ACH50 value and pull out the "basic infiltration" from that.

I agree that 1ACH at 50Pa is challenging with standard practice construction.
The average new home in NZ without anything special is about
6ACH at 50Pa.That said, two weeks ago, I witnessed a blower door test of
a passive house
(1st time builder) that was less than 0.3ACH at 50Pa the first time we turned
on the blower door. This was the first time this builder had attempted an
"airtight" house - after fixing a few oversights it was at
0.26ACH at 50Pa.The structure was designed to be sealed properly and he
used ProClima's
tapes and membranes. If you build  a SIP house it is also likely to be
under 1ACH50 without trying too hard.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modelling Infiltration for Low Energy Houses
Hi,

I've created a detailed multi-zone model of a low energy home in Canada in
EnergyPlus. I am looking at the peak heating load results and finding that
the infiltration predicted seems quite high. I'd be interested to hear how
other building modellers are approaching infiltration, and any general
thoughts anyone has on this situation.

The model is based on the design - the house has not been constructed yet,
but it is assumed that an ACH at 50pa rating of 1 can be achieved. EnergyPlus
has a simple infiltration modelling option, where the air leakage can be
input as ACH@ regular pressure (I've assumed this is equal to 1/20 = 0.05).

EnergyPlus's basic infiltration model can adjust the infiltration rate for
delta T and windspeed, using the following formula:

Infiltration = I_design * {A + B (T_zone - T_outdoor) + C*windspeed +
D*windspeed^2 }****

** **

The big question I have is what coefficients should be used? EPlus provides
three suggestions:


1. coefficients from BLAST:


A =     0.606,                   !- Constant Term Coefficient****

B =     0.03636,                 !- Temperature Term Coefficient****

C =    0.1177,                  !- Velocity Term Coefficient****

D =    0;                       !- Velocity Squared Term Coefficient


2. coeffs from DOE: 0, 0, 0.224 (windpeed), 0


3.Default: 1,0,0,0 which means a constant ACH with no modification.


The BLAST coefficients seemed to be the best to me because I think wind and
temperature difference should be accounted for and there should always be
some basic infiltration. However, using these coefficients at the peak
heating load condition (delta T ~ 40C, windpeed = 27 km/hr) the
infiltration rate is tripled from the base 0.05 ACH, and the total load
from infiltration equals 2.2 kW, which is the largest component of the
heating load.


For a relatively tight house this seems like an unrealistic value to me,
but I do not have much to compare it against.



Thanks,


Hayes

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Modelling Infiltration for Low Energy Houses

Hi Hayes,****

** **

The ZoneInfiltration:EffectiveLeakageArea approach in E+ might give you
better results as it is tailored for residential buildings.  It accounts
for stack, wind and sheltering better than the
ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate method, which is used more for larger
building models.  ****

** **

Regardless of the method, the bigger problem is the infiltration schedule.
You could start with the schedules they have in eQuest.   The operation of
the HRV will affect the infiltration schedule.  And, on larger buildings,
of course, infiltration in core zones can be set to zero.****

** **

On a 600m3 house, ACH50 = 1.0 is roughly 166 L/s.  This is about 55 L/s at
10Pa,  and translates to an effective leakage area of about 0.45 cm/m2.
These are what I would use as design numbers.   From experience, ACH50 =
1.0 (even 1.5) is a challenging target to reach and can?t be reached unless
you use a blower door during construction.  ****

** **

Hope this helps,****

Dear colleagues,
As previously announced we will be hosting the 2nd DIVA Day on July 15th, 2013 at the offices of Thornton Tomasetti in New York City. DIVA Day is a conference on the use of environmental analysis in design practice and research.  The full-day event includes a series of presentations and discussions, focused on how DIVA and associated simulation tools can be used in design and performance-evaluation workflows.  Sessions include introductions to new features by the DIVA Team, and research and case studies by practitioners at leading architectural, engineering and consulting firms and universities. This year, the afternoon will be devoted to an ?Educators Session? which will focus on ways DIVA is used in college and university architectural and building technology education. We are adding presenters daily. For more information on DIVA Day 2013 click here<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2013/agenda>. Early bird registration will end on June 14.
Best regards,

Hi, Bill - I had this situation once, and I rotated the baseline and submitted it. I got the following comment:

Table 1.8.1 and Table 1.8.1(b) of the template include the simulation results for the 90-degree, 180-degree, and 270-degree Baseline model rotations; however, since this project is an addition to an existing project, the Baseline model must not be simulated for the different rotations. Revise Table 1.8.1 and Table 1.8.1(b) by excluding the results for the 90-degree, 180-degree, and 270-degree Baseline model rotations.

Thanks Jim, Stormy.

The project doesn't seem to meet the definition/intent of "addition". It has independent MEP systems and it doesn't share any structural elements with the two other dorms that it is connected to. It just has doors in the stairwells that allow access to the central corridors of the adjacent two dorms.

Nevertheless, I will skip the baseline rotations and let the LEED Reviewer tell me otherwise.

Hi, Bill - I had this situation once, and I rotated the baseline and submitted it. I got the following comment:

Table 1.8.1 and Table 1.8.1(b) of the template include the simulation results for the 90-degree, 180-degree, and 270-degree Baseline model rotations; however, since this project is an addition to an existing project, the Baseline model must not be simulated for the different rotations. Revise Table 1.8.1 and Table 1.8.1(b) by excluding the results for the 90-degree, 180-degree, and 270-degree Baseline model rotations.

Just to toss a slightly different experience into the hat:

I recently had a grouping of 3 LEED projects (new building footprint was minimal) sharing the following identical comment language:

"Note that only projects that are greater than 50% new construction are required to simulate all four rotations. Please revise the energy model as required and report only the zero degree rotation in Table EAp2-4."

I think this is a LEED-specific line in the sand, but my takeaway is that buildings which are largely new construction (by >50%) are expected to be rotated for the baseline.

For these recent models, this direction had negligible effect on the documented performance, but I was able to save some fraction of time/effort for the second round of documentation.

Having experienced this, it was a pretty painless fix - I wish all LEED review commentary were this easy!  If I were at all unsure on this issue at the first submittal, prior to review commentary, I might just plan on doing the rotations anyway as it's a pretty easy thing to untick the parametric runs and assemble less documentation if it comes up (under eQuest/DOE2).

If you have some weeks prior to your submission deadline, I've heard that contacting GBCI's technical staff directly by email has worked well for others:  http://www.gbci.org/contactcertification.aspx  This isn't the same thing as a formal CIR (it's free), and I understand they'll tell you plainly if your clarification needs to be submitted as a formal CIR for the project.  If you should pursue this option, let us know how it turns out!

Regards,

~Nick

Like Nick said, this was probably one of the easiest ever revisions to a model as a result of reviewer comments. For a little more background on the project for which I got the review comment below, it was a LEED NC project, and the LEED project boundary included only new construction. The new building was constructed up against an existing building and there was a door between the two buildings for access. The new building had independent MEP systems and structure. One entire face of my building had adiabatic "exterior" walls (those that were shared with the existing building). Therefore, rotating the building was kind of a silly exercise because those adiabatic walls could never have been on any other orientation of the building in real life... not that Appendix G doesn't make us model unrealistic things all the time, but I figure that was the reviewer's rationale.

I have had success getting questions answered by reviewers through the "contact us" feature on LEED Online. I haven't used that option until the final review stage, though, when a disagreement would have resulted in an appeal.

We are looking at sewer heat recovery for a large project in the northwest. I have a couple of questions:


1.       Has anyone used this on a project successfully

2.       How do you model it? My initial though is to model it as a lake/well ground loop heat exchanger, but there's probably a good reason not to do it that way.
Thanks in advance

Hi Vikram,

My gut reaction would be to determine (or preferably get others to determine) what an annual temperature profile would look like for the... effluent.  Get the same person to inform you of whatever special considerations should be given to pumping energies and heat exchanging elements.

Transpose that information onto a lake/well heat exchanger, and go to town!

Worth noting however, I have had mixed hurdles in the past when working with water-to-water heat exchangers.  Some projects were smooth/easy and others were tougher to set up properly - it would probably be advisable to play with setting your hydronic systems up early (with default inputs as needed) just to be sure you will have a working game plan once all the information you plan to receive is available.  This exercise may help uncover some other information you need to seek out along the way.

Regards,

~Nick

Our company looked at this years ago (before I joined them) as an alternative to cooling towers.  As I understand we had to ditch it as the water authority was changing their infrastructure and moving sewer pumping stations which was the nail in the coffin.  However that aside the variability of flows and the fact that they are not guaranteed was a big barrier.  We would still have had to have a backup heat rejection source...  There has also been a huge move towards water efficiency in Australia (driest continent next to Antarctica) in the past 15+ years and recycled water plants are more common in precinct and larger buildings.  So liquor flows are on the decline with all else equal.  Just became more work and uncertainty than it was worth...  Your situation may be different ?

Regards,
Graham
