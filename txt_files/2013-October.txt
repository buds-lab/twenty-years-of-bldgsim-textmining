I'm with Karen - I don't think you can simply explain this one away to a LEED reviewer and will need to address/correct the issues you've identified

If I'm not mistaken, "adiabatic" isn't an option for exterior surfaces however, at least through the eQuest detailed mode interface.  You could make a distinct roof construction which has an impossibly low U-value to severely limit heat transfer (to/from exterior conditions), but that won't correct the roof area figures your reviewer is tuned into.

In my opinion, the easiest reasonable thing to do would to assert (if you can) the thermostat setpoints are the identical between floors and therefore it's reasonable to not model heat transfer between floors, which means you can simply delete those "non-exposed" roofs.  Re-defining those surfaces to be adiabatic ceiling/floor (using an interior wall construction) would have the same net effect except to define additional thermal mass for the associated spaces.

The "partially correct" roof surface(s) on the other hand, which are both exposed and sandwiched, ought to be modified equally in both models to correct the exposed portion.  How simple/involved this is depends on your project's geometries.

Here's a procedure for a correcting a partially sandwiched, single surface roof.  This is done in detailed mode and assumes wizard-based model assembly:

-          Navigate to 3D view, highlight the roof surface to be edited

-          Open properties window for that surface via the component tree or right-click context menu.

-          Identify the referenced space polygon (green text) in the surface properties

-          Scroll down to that polygon in the component tree, right click, create a new polygon, copy the one you identified - name it anything you'll easily find in a long list.

-          Re-highlight that roof surface in the 3D view and open its properties window

-          Re-assign the polygon (green text) to the copied polygon with a unique name (will now be red text).  Click Done.  3D view should look like nothing has changed at this point.

o   Save a copy of your project separately before proceeding!

-          Keeping a clear view of the roof section to be edited, now scroll down and double click on the new copied polygon to pull up its vertices.

-          From here, play around with manually removing vertices to identify which consecutive series bounds the sandwiched portion of the surface. You will observe which vertices go away or move in the 3D view behind if you delete/edit these inputs.

-          Determine whether you need to define any new vertices, to define the "seam" edge where exposed roof meets exposed wall.  If so, experiment with editing a vertex to determine appropriate X/Y coordinates.

-          Once you've identified the vertices to remove and add, for eQuest stability reasons I try to edit existing polygon vertices before removing anything from the list (you'll typically end up with fewer vertices than you started).  This is hard to put to words but bear with me:  From the first vertex, identify the range which should remain (if any), then edit the following vertex points to any new coordinates you may have determined for additional points, then copy the series of vertices to remain from the end of the list up, then finally right-click and restore default to remove all vertices remaining in the list, starting from the bottom.

-          For context, I personally do not treat new/edited vertex coordinates super-precisely typically - anything that looks close to right in the 3D view is good enough for LEED.  Remember you'll be doing the same edits to both models.  Don't get worked up over small seams/holes in the picture - they don't cause roof leaks in in the model!

Procedure for a multi-surface roof (one per space/plenum) is the similar except you do it for each partially sandwiched roof section (don't worry this gets quicker/easier after the first couple).  Those fully-sandwiched sections can either be fully deleted per the above logic, or else re-defined as interior floor/ceiling surfaces if deemed necessary.

Until you wrap up such polygon geometry edits, save separately and often, and run a simulation to test everything is working okay.  I've had some mixed results doing such edits with eQuest interface open.  You may see errors/cautions pop up that can be simply clicked through without consequence.

When all is said and done, one piece of good news is you can save, close, and copy/paste all modified custom polygons between your baseline/proposed models, which makes doing the same edits on the other model as simple as re-assigning polygons (with 3D view up to check your work).

If the "roofs" don't have a zone as the outside boundary condition, then the model views them as roofs exposed to the exterior.  You need to fix this. If the spaces on the other side have the same thermostat setpoints, then the easiest thing to do is set the roof type to "adiabatic". This will save you from having to define new polygons if the floor above has different zone shapes.  For a roof that is only partially covered by the floor above, you need to create the new polygons. Sorry.

my understanding (in my case) is that if you create multiple shells and place them with a common wall that you want to be an interior the shell rotations need to be zero, even if you have the separation between the two shells occur at a 45 deg angle (then ask mr. architect about that one).

Hi Gang:

I need to elite for this one, and you know who you are..

I am reviewing another party's eQuest model submitted for LEED. The reviewer noted that the roof area far exceeded the actual building footprint.

Well, guess why? Somehow, the other party made several floors ROOFS instead of ceilings. I might be able to simply turn the exterior spaces into interior ceilings, but one roof (over an unheated underground garage) is partially uder the building and partially exposed to the "sidewalk/entrance" of the building.

The BIG Kahuena is this..if a space is crammed next to an adjacent space and one of the spaces claims an Exterioir surface between them, does DOE-2 think that Exterior surface is seeing outdoor conditions? Or does it ignore such a thin and merely considers the heat transfer between the spaces (like the wall/roof is NOT exposed to the outdoors)?

My approach is this (unless you disagree)..leave the Exterior wall/roof along and explain that the model (now in Detailed Edit form) would need major surgery to correct to show actual roof area. Having the "roofs" there versus floors will not change the thermodynamics of heat transfer.

I yield to the floor.

Maybe I'm missing something here, but why not just change those roofs that you want 
adiabatic to be Interior-walls and then change the INT-WALL-TYPE to be ADIABATIC ?   
Wouldn't that take care of both the heat flow problem as well as the area numbers ?

Hi Joe,

I briefly addressed that possibility in the highlighted line below.  I've done the same in the past, but I think often converting surface types can be more effort than necessary (I'd just delete them if it made sense for the circumstances).

That said, it's no effort to share a link for completeness =).  For a procedure detailing how to make an exterior surface an interior surface, here's an illustrated guide I posted a while ago:  http://onebuilding.org/wiki/doku.php/convert_an_exterior_surface_to_an_interior_surface_detailed

Most of my reply below is detailing how I deal with partially sandwiched surfaces through the eQuest interface, which requires polygon edits for correction.  I don't think I ever shared that previously on the lists...

Here's a procedure for a correcting a partially sandwiched, single surface roof.  This is done in detailed mode and assumes wizard-based model assembly:

Navigate to 3D view, highlight the roof surface to be edited

Open properties window for that surface via the component tree or right-click context menu.

Identify the referenced space polygon (green text) in the surface properties

Scroll down to that polygon in the component tree, right click, create a new polygon, copy the one you identified - name it anything you'll easily find in a long list.

Re-highlight that roof surface in the 3D view and open its properties window

Re-assign the polygon (green text) to the copied polygon with a unique name (will now be red text).  Click Done.  3D view should look like nothing has changed at this point.

Save a copy of your project separately before proceeding!

Keeping a clear view of the roof section to be edited, now scroll down and double click on the new copied polygon to pull up its vertices.

>From here, play around with manually removing vertices to identify which consecutive series bounds the sandwiched portion of the surface. You will observe which vertices go away or move in the 3D view behind if you delete/edit these inputs.

Determine whether you need to define any new vertices, to define the "seam" edge where exposed roof meets exposed wall.  If so, experiment with editing a vertex to determine appropriate X/Y coordinates.

Once you've identified the vertices to remove and add, for eQuest stability reasons I try to edit existing polygon vertices before removing anything from the list (you'll typically end up with fewer vertices than you started).  This is hard to put to words but bear with me:  From the first vertex, identify the range which should remain (if any), then edit the following vertex points to any new coordinates you may have determined for additional points, then copy the series of vertices to remain from the end of the list up, then finally right-click and restore default to remove all vertices remaining in the list, starting from the bottom.

For context, I personally do not treat new/edited vertex coordinates super-precisely typically - anything that looks close to right in the 3D view is good enough for LEED.  Remember you'll be doing the same edits to both models.  Don't get worked up over small seams/holes in the picture - they don't cause roof leaks in in the model!

Procedure for a multi-surface roof (one per space/plenum) is the similar except you do it for each partially sandwiched roof section (don't worry this gets quicker/easier after the first couple).  Those fully-sandwiched sections can either be fully deleted per the above logic, or else re-defined as interior floor/ceiling surfaces if deemed necessary.

Until you wrap up such polygon geometry edits, save separately and often, and run a simulation to test everything is working okay.  I've had some mixed results doing such edits with eQuest interface open.  You may see errors/cautions pop up that can be simply clicked through without consequence.

When all is said and done, one piece of good news is you can save, close, and copy/paste all modified custom polygons between your baseline/proposed models, which makes doing the same edits on the other model as simple as re-assigning polygons (with 3D view up to check your work).

If the "roofs" don't have a zone as the outside boundary condition, then the model views them as roofs exposed to the exterior.  You need to fix this. If the spaces on the other side have the same thermostat setpoints, then the easiest thing to do is set the roof type to "adiabatic". This will save you from having to define new polygons if the floor above has different zone shapes.  For a roof that is only partially covered by the floor above, you need to create the new polygons. Sorry.

I am reviewing another party's eQuest model submitted for LEED. The reviewer noted that the roof area far exceeded the actual building footprint.

Well, guess why? Somehow, the other party made several floors ROOFS instead of ceilings. I might be able to simply turn the exterior spaces into interior ceilings, but one roof (over an unheated underground garage) is partially uder the building and partially exposed to the "sidewalk/entrance" of the building.

The BIG Kahuena is this..if a space is crammed next to an adjacent space and one of the spaces claims an Exterioir surface between them, does DOE-2 think that Exterior surface is seeing outdoor conditions? Or does it ignore such a thin and merely considers the heat transfer between the spaces (like the wall/roof is NOT exposed to the outdoors)?

My approach is this (unless you disagree)..leave the Exterior wall/roof along and explain that the model (now in Detailed Edit form) would need major surgery to correct to show actual roof area. Having the "roofs" there versus floors will not change the thermodynamics of heat transfer.

I yield to the floor.

I would recommend deleting the roofs where roofs are actually not and create a floor and a ceiling.  In order for two spaces to most accurately model heat transfer between them, each space needs to have a construction at the joining surface.

For example, a single space per floor that is two storey's will need a ceiling construction on the first floor and a floor construction on the second floor.

Also, as mentioned...a construction will need to be created for all spaces that have adjoining surfaces.
Take the example above and make the second storey two spaces, the single space on the first floor will need two separate ceiling constructions as the second floor spaces will have two floor constructions.

This is the kind of stuff they don't talk about at home 'building energy modeling' school.  I suppose either way might not matter much for green building rating systems but I have seen it make a difference in unmet hours, usage, etc.

Thanks,
Kevin

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Really need some deep DOE-2 theology on this one..

I'm with Karen - I don't think you can simply explain this one away to a LEED reviewer and will need to address/correct the issues you've identified

If I'm not mistaken, "adiabatic" isn't an option for exterior surfaces however, at least through the eQuest detailed mode interface.  You could make a distinct roof construction which has an impossibly low U-value to severely limit heat transfer (to/from exterior conditions), but that won't correct the roof area figures your reviewer is tuned into.

In my opinion, the easiest reasonable thing to do would to assert (if you can) the thermostat setpoints are the identical between floors and therefore it's reasonable to not model heat transfer between floors, which means you can simply delete those "non-exposed" roofs.  Re-defining those surfaces to be adiabatic ceiling/floor (using an interior wall construction) would have the same net effect except to define additional thermal mass for the associated spaces.

The "partially correct" roof surface(s) on the other hand, which are both exposed and sandwiched, ought to be modified equally in both models to correct the exposed portion.  How simple/involved this is depends on your project's geometries.

Here's a procedure for a correcting a partially sandwiched, single surface roof.  This is done in detailed mode and assumes wizard-based model assembly:

-          Navigate to 3D view, highlight the roof surface to be edited

-          Open properties window for that surface via the component tree or right-click context menu.

-          Identify the referenced space polygon (green text) in the surface properties

-          Scroll down to that polygon in the component tree, right click, create a new polygon, copy the one you identified - name it anything you'll easily find in a long list.

-          Re-highlight that roof surface in the 3D view and open its properties window

-          Re-assign the polygon (green text) to the copied polygon with a unique name (will now be red text).  Click Done.  3D view should look like nothing has changed at this point.

o   Save a copy of your project separately before proceeding!

-          Keeping a clear view of the roof section to be edited, now scroll down and double click on the new copied polygon to pull up its vertices.

-          From here, play around with manually removing vertices to identify which consecutive series bounds the sandwiched portion of the surface. You will observe which vertices go away or move in the 3D view behind if you delete/edit these inputs.

-          Determine whether you need to define any new vertices, to define the "seam" edge where exposed roof meets exposed wall.  If so, experiment with editing a vertex to determine appropriate X/Y coordinates.

-          Once you've identified the vertices to remove and add, for eQuest stability reasons I try to edit existing polygon vertices before removing anything from the list (you'll typically end up with fewer vertices than you started).  This is hard to put to words but bear with me:  From the first vertex, identify the range which should remain (if any), then edit the following vertex points to any new coordinates you may have determined for additional points, then copy the series of vertices to remain from the end of the list up, then finally right-click and restore default to remove all vertices remaining in the list, starting from the bottom.

-          For context, I personally do not treat new/edited vertex coordinates super-precisely typically - anything that looks close to right in the 3D view is good enough for LEED.  Remember you'll be doing the same edits to both models.  Don't get worked up over small seams/holes in the picture - they don't cause roof leaks in in the model!

Procedure for a multi-surface roof (one per space/plenum) is the similar except you do it for each partially sandwiched roof section (don't worry this gets quicker/easier after the first couple).  Those fully-sandwiched sections can either be fully deleted per the above logic, or else re-defined as interior floor/ceiling surfaces if deemed necessary.

Until you wrap up such polygon geometry edits, save separately and often, and run a simulation to test everything is working okay.  I've had some mixed results doing such edits with eQuest interface open.  You may see errors/cautions pop up that can be simply clicked through without consequence.

When all is said and done, one piece of good news is you can save, close, and copy/paste all modified custom polygons between your baseline/proposed models, which makes doing the same edits on the other model as simple as re-assigning polygons (with 3D view up to check your work).

If the "roofs" don't have a zone as the outside boundary condition, then the model views them as roofs exposed to the exterior.  You need to fix this. If the spaces on the other side have the same thermostat setpoints, then the easiest thing to do is set the roof type to "adiabatic". This will save you from having to define new polygons if the floor above has different zone shapes.  For a roof that is only partially covered by the floor above, you need to create the new polygons.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] CAV to VAV issues in EnergyPlus
Message-ID: <CAAWVJ6gQowMRYNSEYonhuaNi-5Z_LVLCnjvms+p89bdoZZz9fg@mail.gmail.com>

I will start out by saying I am not an EnergyPlus expert. I am trying to
convert one of the DOE commercial building E+ prototypes from a CAV system
to a VAV system to determine the energy savings. I have modified the
baseline CAV model for one of the zones thus far to a VAV system, but the
VAV model is using more energy than the CAV model. I also have a lot more
unmet hours for both heating and cooling. I cannot figure out what is
causing these issues (I assume they are related). My current guess is that
I continue to use the same cooling coil (Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed) in
the VAV model, rather than converting the coil to Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed
as I see in most of the other DOE prototype VAV models.

My questions are:
1. Is it ok to use the Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed in a VAV system, or
should I convert that to a Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed?
2. If it I convert the VAV model to the Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed is this
analogous to modifying the baseline compressor to a variable speed
compressor?

Thanks for any help.

To be clear, for an eQuest/DOE2 model I'm pretty sure only a single surface need be defined to transfer heat between two zones.  It can be defined under either space and thermally linked to the other space via the "NEXT-TO" parameter.

I believe defining a surface in both spaces, each linking the other space, for the same real-world construction plane would in effect double the surface area for transfer between the spaces.

In the common scenario of a plenum in between floors (meaning three zones), a minimum of two surfaces (representative of the "ceiling" and "floor/deck" constructions) are required to model heat transfer between all three zones.

I agree there are cases where inter-floor heat transfer cannot be dismissed as negligible, I simply mean to highlight there are scenarios where this case can be made, which can simplify how to address the posed issue of incorrect roof surface areas.  As with any consideration of simplification in an energy model, if one is ever unsure it's usually better to err on the side of "more accurate," time allowing.  This allows you to explore either option and gain first-hand experience that will help you make such judgements in the future.

You could say I'm one of those self-taught/home-schooled energy modelers however (many of us on these lists are), so please do not hesitate to correct or inform me if I'm missing anything commonly taught in the formal programs!  One of the most valuable lessons I've learned to apply to the field of energy modeling, paraphrasing Donald Rumsfeld<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns>: There are always things you know, things you don't know, and things you don't know you don't know.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Really need some deep DOE-2 theology on this one..

I would recommend deleting the roofs where roofs are actually not and create a floor and a ceiling.  In order for two spaces to most accurately model heat transfer between them, each space needs to have a construction at the joining surface.

For example, a single space per floor that is two storey's will need a ceiling construction on the first floor and a floor construction on the second floor.

Also, as mentioned...a construction will need to be created for all spaces that have adjoining surfaces.
Take the example above and make the second storey two spaces, the single space on the first floor will need two separate ceiling constructions as the second floor spaces will have two floor constructions.

This is the kind of stuff they don't talk about at home 'building energy modeling' school.  I suppose either way might not matter much for green building rating systems but I have seen it make a difference in unmet hours, usage, etc.

Thanks,
Kevin

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Really need some deep DOE-2 theology on this one..

I'm with Karen - I don't think you can simply explain this one away to a LEED reviewer and will need to address/correct the issues you've identified

If I'm not mistaken, "adiabatic" isn't an option for exterior surfaces however, at least through the eQuest detailed mode interface.  You could make a distinct roof construction which has an impossibly low U-value to severely limit heat transfer (to/from exterior conditions), but that won't correct the roof area figures your reviewer is tuned into.

In my opinion, the easiest reasonable thing to do would to assert (if you can) the thermostat setpoints are the identical between floors and therefore it's reasonable to not model heat transfer between floors, which means you can simply delete those "non-exposed" roofs.  Re-defining those surfaces to be adiabatic ceiling/floor (using an interior wall construction) would have the same net effect except to define additional thermal mass for the associated spaces.

The "partially correct" roof surface(s) on the other hand, which are both exposed and sandwiched, ought to be modified equally in both models to correct the exposed portion.  How simple/involved this is depends on your project's geometries.

Here's a procedure for a correcting a partially sandwiched, single surface roof.  This is done in detailed mode and assumes wizard-based model assembly:

-          Navigate to 3D view, highlight the roof surface to be edited

-          Open properties window for that surface via the component tree or right-click context menu.

-          Identify the referenced space polygon (green text) in the surface properties

-          Scroll down to that polygon in the component tree, right click, create a new polygon, copy the one you identified - name it anything you'll easily find in a long list.

-          Re-highlight that roof surface in the 3D view and open its properties window

-          Re-assign the polygon (green text) to the copied polygon with a unique name (will now be red text).  Click Done.  3D view should look like nothing has changed at this point.

o   Save a copy of your project separately before proceeding!

-          Keeping a clear view of the roof section to be edited, now scroll down and double click on the new copied polygon to pull up its vertices.

-          From here, play around with manually removing vertices to identify which consecutive series bounds the sandwiched portion of the surface. You will observe which vertices go away or move in the 3D view behind if you delete/edit these inputs.

-          Determine whether you need to define any new vertices, to define the "seam" edge where exposed roof meets exposed wall.  If so, experiment with editing a vertex to determine appropriate X/Y coordinates.

-          Once you've identified the vertices to remove and add, for eQuest stability reasons I try to edit existing polygon vertices before removing anything from the list (you'll typically end up with fewer vertices than you started).  This is hard to put to words but bear with me:  From the first vertex, identify the range which should remain (if any), then edit the following vertex points to any new coordinates you may have determined for additional points, then copy the series of vertices to remain from the end of the list up, then finally right-click and restore default to remove all vertices remaining in the list, starting from the bottom.

-          For context, I personally do not treat new/edited vertex coordinates super-precisely typically - anything that looks close to right in the 3D view is good enough for LEED.  Remember you'll be doing the same edits to both models.  Don't get worked up over small seams/holes in the picture - they don't cause roof leaks in in the model!

Procedure for a multi-surface roof (one per space/plenum) is the similar except you do it for each partially sandwiched roof section (don't worry this gets quicker/easier after the first couple).  Those fully-sandwiched sections can either be fully deleted per the above logic, or else re-defined as interior floor/ceiling surfaces if deemed necessary.

Until you wrap up such polygon geometry edits, save separately and often, and run a simulation to test everything is working okay.  I've had some mixed results doing such edits with eQuest interface open.  You may see errors/cautions pop up that can be simply clicked through without consequence.

When all is said and done, one piece of good news is you can save, close, and copy/paste all modified custom polygons between your baseline/proposed models, which makes doing the same edits on the other model as simple as re-assigning polygons (with 3D view up to check your work).

Ryan,

In terms of debugging your model, it would be constructive to know where the energy use differs: increased heating, cooling, or fan energy? Also, you may want to take a look at the table file and double-check that the coil and fan sizes, and design OA flow rates are identical between the two models. It's possible that in your conversion you modified something that is causing your system to size differently (presuming you're not hard-sizing everything). That's where I'd start.

Thanks,
Danny

Ok, that is right.  The INTERIOR-WALL dictionary discussion appears to address this.  Maybe its Eplus that needs walls for each space that is adjacent.

I'm with Karen - I don't think you can simply explain this one away to a LEED reviewer and will need to address/correct the issues you've identified

If I'm not mistaken, "adiabatic" isn't an option for exterior surfaces however, at least through the eQuest detailed mode interface.  You could make a distinct roof construction which has an impossibly low U-value to severely limit heat transfer (to/from exterior conditions), but that won't correct the roof area figures your reviewer is tuned into.

In my opinion, the easiest reasonable thing to do would to assert (if you can) the thermostat setpoints are the identical between floors and therefore it's reasonable to not model heat transfer between floors, which means you can simply delete those "non-exposed" roofs.  Re-defining those surfaces to be adiabatic ceiling/floor (using an interior wall construction) would have the same net effect except to define additional thermal mass for the associated spaces.

The "partially correct" roof surface(s) on the other hand, which are both exposed and sandwiched, ought to be modified equally in both models to correct the exposed portion.  How simple/involved this is depends on your project's geometries.

Here's a procedure for a correcting a partially sandwiched, single surface roof.  This is done in detailed mode and assumes wizard-based model assembly:

-          Navigate to 3D view, highlight the roof surface to be edited

-          Open properties window for that surface via the component tree or right-click context menu.

-          Identify the referenced space polygon (green text) in the surface properties

-          Scroll down to that polygon in the component tree, right click, create a new polygon, copy the one you identified - name it anything you'll easily find in a long list.

-          Re-highlight that roof surface in the 3D view and open its properties window

-          Re-assign the polygon (green text) to the copied polygon with a unique name (will now be red text).  Click Done.  3D view should look like nothing has changed at this point.

o   Save a copy of your project separately before proceeding!

-          Keeping a clear view of the roof section to be edited, now scroll down and double click on the new copied polygon to pull up its vertices.

-          From here, play around with manually removing vertices to identify which consecutive series bounds the sandwiched portion of the surface. You will observe which vertices go away or move in the 3D view behind if you delete/edit these inputs.

-          Determine whether you need to define any new vertices, to define the "seam" edge where exposed roof meets exposed wall.  If so, experiment with editing a vertex to determine appropriate X/Y coordinates.

-          Once you've identified the vertices to remove and add, for eQuest stability reasons I try to edit existing polygon vertices before removing anything from the list (you'll typically end up with fewer vertices than you started).  This is hard to put to words but bear with me:  From the first vertex, identify the range which should remain (if any), then edit the following vertex points to any new coordinates you may have determined for additional points, then copy the series of vertices to remain from the end of the list up, then finally right-click and restore default to remove all vertices remaining in the list, starting from the bottom.

-          For context, I personally do not treat new/edited vertex coordinates super-precisely typically - anything that looks close to right in the 3D view is good enough for LEED.  Remember you'll be doing the same edits to both models.  Don't get worked up over small seams/holes in the picture - they don't cause roof leaks in in the model!

Procedure for a multi-surface roof (one per space/plenum) is the similar except you do it for each partially sandwiched roof section (don't worry this gets quicker/easier after the first couple).  Those fully-sandwiched sections can either be fully deleted per the above logic, or else re-defined as interior floor/ceiling surfaces if deemed necessary.

Until you wrap up such polygon geometry edits, save separately and often, and run a simulation to test everything is working okay.  I've had some mixed results doing such edits with eQuest interface open.  You may see errors/cautions pop up that can be simply clicked through without consequence.

When all is said and done, one piece of good news is you can save, close, and copy/paste all modified custom polygons between your baseline/proposed models, which makes doing the same edits on the other model as simple as re-assigning polygons (with 3D view up to check your work).

If the "roofs" don't have a zone as the outside boundary condition, then the model views them as roofs exposed to the exterior.  You need to fix this. If the spaces on the other side have the same thermostat setpoints, then the easiest thing to do is set the roof type to "adiabatic". This will save you from having to define new polygons if the floor above has different zone shapes.  For a roof that is only partially covered by the floor above, you need to create the new polygons. Sorry.

this sounds like you have multiple shells in one model for this to occur?  i'm pretty sure equest views an exterior wall/roof as an exterior wall/roof even if it is bounded by an interior wall.  i had this problem come up on one of my own models where i ended up having a building wing meet the building trunk & as i had put them in as 2 separate shells equest did not recognize the dividing wall where the wing met the trunk as being an interior wall & assigned it (via the wizard) an exterior wall definition.  i didn't catch this until reviewing the unmet load hour ss-r & s-va reports & couldn't figure out why the load was so high.  changed the definition of the wall to interior (with a door) in detailed mode and the unmet load hours went to zero and the load came down.

my understanding (in my case) is that if you create multiple shells and place them with a common wall that you want to be an interior the shell rotations need to be zero, even if you have the separation between the two shells occur at a 45 deg angle (then ask mr. architect about that one).

Hi Gang:

I need to elite for this one, and you know who you are..

I am reviewing another party's eQuest model submitted for LEED. The reviewer noted that the roof area far exceeded the actual building footprint.

Well, guess why? Somehow, the other party made several floors ROOFS instead of ceilings. I might be able to simply turn the exterior spaces into interior ceilings, but one roof (over an unheated underground garage) is partially uder the building and partially exposed to the "sidewalk/entrance" of the building.

The BIG Kahuena is this..if a space is crammed next to an adjacent space and one of the spaces claims an Exterioir surface between them, does DOE-2 think that Exterior surface is seeing outdoor conditions? Or does it ignore such a thin and merely considers the heat transfer between the spaces (like the wall/roof is NOT exposed to the outdoors)?

My approach is this (unless you disagree)..leave the Exterior wall/roof along and explain that the model (now in Detailed Edit form) would need major surgery to correct to show actual roof area. Having the "roofs" there versus floors will not change the thermodynamics of heat transfer.

I yield to the floor.

Thanks for the quick reply Daniel.

I have checked the Report: Equipment Summary tables. Here all is identical
between the two models, except for the Heating Coil for the zone I
modified. For the VAV system, the Heating Coil nominal capacity is 28,369 W
vs 68,845 W for the CAV system. All the other heating, cooling and fan
systems are sized the same between the models.

In the Report: HVAC Sizing Summary everything is identical.

For the zone I switched the Time Setpoint Not Met has increased
significantly for both cooling and heating, and during occupied and
unoccupied periods.

In the Outdoor Air summary: both mechanical ventilation and infiltration
are minimally different in all zones (differences are in the hundredths).

As for where the energy differences are:
Fan Energy: slight decrease in overall fan energy (I have only changed a
small zone)
Heating: increase in heating energy
Cooling: increase in cooling energy

I think this sums it up. From this, maybe the issue is with the heating
rather than the cooling coils. There is a significant difference in the
heating coil nominal capacity.

Hi Ryan,

Check VAV minimum airflow set point within the zone which might be a big
reason to increase the reheat load and the cooling load accordingly.

You are asking for weather data for a fairly war-torn location, so the chances of 
continuous weather data is not good.

According to the ISH data base, there is a WMO weather station at FOB BAMYAN WMO#671774, 
located at 34.817 N, 67.833 E, but there's only 3 months of data for 2013.  Prior to 2013, 
the same WMO #671774 was listed as COP CHEROKEE (probably a US army base) located at 
33.65N, 68.900 E, with three years of data (2010, 2011, and 2012).

These historical weather files (AFG_FOB-BAMYAN_691774_13,  AFG_COP-CHEROKEE_691774_12, 
AFG_COP-CHEROKEE_691774_11, AFG_COP-CHEROKEE_691774_10) can all be found on my weather 
data web site
( http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com ), although I would not recommend getting the 
Bamyan 2013 file due to data incompleteness.  These historical weather files cost $50 
each, and can be downloaded immediately.

In addition, I can also create a rough "typical year" weather file from the 3 available 
years for COP-CHEROKEE_691774,
but that would be a custom request.  For such custom typical year weather files, I charge 
$75, with a turnaround of an hour during working hours.

To All

Does anyone on this list know of a version of Equest that has been modified
to handle CHP projects in a simple manner?  This would be a great help in
our CHP design course at UIC.

 

Thank You

Jim Dirkes - How refreshing to hear from an articulate, knowledgeable, and
hopeful voice in the building simulation community.  My wife and I only have
one child, but we believe wholeheartedly the future rests on the talents and
energy of each new life, as they get their opportunity to make a difference.

 

Varkie Thomas - If you prefer to downsize the population in order to
maintain your standard of living, I would only ask how who decides who gets
to go on and who does not?  If the vast majority of Americans and the others
comprising the 30% that are using all of our resources, aren't we being a
bit selfish?  Why shouldn't we get along with a few less "things" so others
can at least eat and drink? Then in only a generation or two, or even in
four, if we continue to follow the truths that have gotten us this far, we
will have additional new opportunities to act on; well before the forest,
vegetation, and large animals will be devastated in a few hundred years. 

 

After all we have made quite a bit of progress in the last four generations,
although we must be ever vigilant to keep freedom, life, and liberty for
each individual at the forefront of discussion.

This discussion may not belong in Bldg-Sim.  I received several responses
directly.  All of them the disagreed with my suggestion of human population
control to save energy, the environment and the planet.  The arguments were
similar to the ones below.

Maybe the people that would know anything can't even check their email, or are home working on that novel they've always wanted to write...

 calculation...???...
Message-ID: <29CF09A25AE46E4AA61E6E9073BC97173607861E@AEI-EX1.aeieng.lan>

Hi there,

I came across a strange thing on a LEEDv3 (v2009) project. One team was working on SSc8 and the other on EAc1. While the exterior lighting power density should be calculated in accordance with A90.1-2007, section 9, Table 1 in both cases, the SSc8 template (referring in the description field to A90.1-2007) was automatically looking up A90.1-2010 values (allowable LPD) while EAc1, table 1.4 was using A90.1-2007 values. I know that usually the LEED reviewer flags (cross-checks SSc8 vs EAc1 ext. lighting calcs) this if inconsistency is found. Has anyone experienced a mistake like this???...and how did you resolve it???

Thanks,
Norbert

Norbert,

Our electrical engineer ran into this exact thing Wednesday.

Not sure how he resolved it, but you aren't crazy, we found the same thing.

- I'll see what I can find out Tuesday, after Labor Day, if I'm not furloughed.

I ran into this face first a few months back - see attached attempt at a heads up for more information.

In short, the SSc8 templates are based around 90.1-2007 addendum i, note LEED is a bit misleading and incorrectly calls it addendum 1.

If your project was registered prior to November of 2011 you might be able to make a case to use the pre-addenda calculations.

I anticipate otherwise your SSc8 team needs to re-do their calculations, and you'll need to update your model's proposed/baseline figures in kind.

Sorry for the probably-bad news =(,

~Nick

Good morning, all,

Although Addendum I must be used for projects registered after the cited
date, the Baseline exterior lighting power allowance may still be calculated
bases on 90.1-2007 without addendum i. If using the revised baseline for
SSc8, only the reported proposed exterior lighting power must be reported
identically. The new Supplemental Section 1.4 Tables spreadsheet
automatically calculates the baseline exterior lighting allowance using this
methodology.

Have a great day!

I ran into this face first a few months back - see attached attempt at a
heads up for more information.

In short, the SSc8 templates are based around 90.1-2007 addendum i, note
LEED is a bit misleading and incorrectly calls it addendum 1.

If your project was registered prior to November of 2011 you might be able
to make a case to use the pre-addenda calculations.

I anticipate otherwise your SSc8 team needs to re-do their calculations, and
you'll need to update your model's proposed/baseline figures in kind.

Sorry for the probably-bad news =(,

~Nick

Hi there,

 

I came across a strange thing on a LEEDv3 (v2009) project. One team was
working on SSc8 and the other on EAc1. While the exterior lighting power
density should be calculated in accordance with A90.1-2007, section 9, Table
1 in both cases, the SSc8 template (referring in the description field to
A90.1-2007) was automatically looking up A90.1-2010 values (allowable LPD)
while EAc1, table 1.4 was using A90.1-2007 values. I know that usually the
LEED reviewer flags (cross-checks SSc8 vs EAc1 ext. lighting calcs) this if
inconsistency is found. Has anyone experienced a mistake like this???...and
how did you resolve it???

 

Thanks,

Norbert

All,

Thank you to those that sent replies offline, and to those that didn't because they are frantically doing damage control before getting furloughed. I'll paraphrase the anecdotes (which I have not tried to personally verify):

EPA - closed

-          Portfolio Manager and Target Manager are down.
GSA - closed
NASA - closed
Commerce (NIST) - closed
IRS - closed (at least partially)

DOE/EERE - mixed state of shutdown

-          DOE/EERE funding is not all tied to fiscal year budgets

-          DOE shutdown is still possible, perhaps even this week

National labs - mixed state of shutdown

-          Labs/projects that are industry-funded may be able to stay open longer (but only a few weeks)

-          Labs that are DOE funded will shut down soon, perhaps this week

-          Travel and non-essential spending is curtailed at all labs

-          If DOE shuts down completely, all labs may have to shut down regardless of funding situation

Employees that are furloughed

-          Cannot check email

-          Cannot check voice mail

-          Cannot do any project/lab related work

-          Will not get paid unless Congress authorizes back pay

Again, this information is based on a handful of replies. I have no further information but you can reply to the list and maybe get a your own personal correspondence going.

Regards,
Bill

Hi Cam, thanks for the input!

I've re-read your response a few times and would like to be sure I fully understand.  Would you please confirm (or otherwise correct) the following statements?  

1. Where SSc8 documentation must follow addendum i to calculate the exterior lighting power allowance, the baseline energy model for EAp2/EAc1 may optionally document a differing exterior lighting power allowance per 90.1-2007 without addendum i.  

2. Proposed exterior lighting power should match between SSc8 documentation and the EAp2/EAc1 Proposed energy model, for any case.

Thank you,

~Nick

Good afternoon, Nick,

Correct on both counts. I believe the thinking is that Addendum I aligns
more closely with the variable exterior lighting requirements based on the
project's location (e.g. urban, rural, etc) so it seemed appropriate to
adopt this addendum for SSc8 calculations for LEED projects. Since EAp2-c1
is not required to follow any specific addenda, it is permissible to use the
unmodified calculations to determine the allowance for the baseline case.

Have a great day!

Cam

Hi Cam, thanks for the input!

I've re-read your response a few times and would like to be sure I fully
understand.  Would you please confirm (or otherwise correct) the following
statements?  

1. Where SSc8 documentation must follow addendum i to calculate the exterior
lighting power allowance, the baseline energy model for EAp2/EAc1 may
optionally document a differing exterior lighting power allowance per
90.1-2007 without addendum i.  

2. Proposed exterior lighting power should match between SSc8 documentation
and the EAp2/EAc1 Proposed energy model, for any case.

Thank you,

~Nick

Good morning, all,

Although Addendum I must be used for projects registered after the cited
date, the Baseline exterior lighting power allowance may still be calculated
bases on 90.1-2007 without addendum i. If using the revised baseline for
SSc8, only the reported proposed exterior lighting power must be reported
identically. The new Supplemental Section 1.4 Tables spreadsheet
automatically calculates the baseline exterior lighting allowance using this
methodology.

Have a great day!

I ran into this face first a few months back - see attached attempt at a
heads up for more information.

In short, the SSc8 templates are based around 90.1-2007 addendum i, note
LEED is a bit misleading and incorrectly calls it addendum 1.

If your project was registered prior to November of 2011 you might be able
to make a case to use the pre-addenda calculations.

I anticipate otherwise your SSc8 team needs to re-do their calculations, and
you'll need to update your model's proposed/baseline figures in kind.

Sorry for the probably-bad news =(,

Hi there,

 

I came across a strange thing on a LEEDv3 (v2009) project. One team was
working on SSc8 and the other on EAc1. While the exterior lighting power
density should be calculated in accordance with A90.1-2007, section 9, Table
1 in both cases, the SSc8 template (referring in the description field to
A90.1-2007) was automatically looking up A90.1-2010 values (allowable LPD)
while EAc1, table 1.4 was using A90.1-2007 values. I know that usually the
LEED reviewer flags (cross-checks SSc8 vs EAc1 ext. lighting calcs) this if
inconsistency is found. Has anyone experienced a mistake like this???...and
how did you resolve it???

 

Thanks,

Norbert

Good afternoon, Nick,

Correct on both counts. I believe the thinking is that Addendum I aligns more closely with the variable exterior lighting requirements based on the project's location (e.g. urban, rural, etc) so it seemed appropriate to adopt this addendum for SSc8 calculations for LEED projects. Since EAp2-c1 is not required to follow any specific addenda, it is permissible to use the unmodified calculations to determine the allowance for the baseline case.

Have a great day!

Cam

This clarification is immediately helpful for a current project I'm working on, and I'm sure almost any other project seeking SSc8 alongside energy model credits.

 Insider's Perspective
Message-ID: <8F29443B220B3D48A035EFB2FEEB8CB40E08EE4C@GL-EXC-01.iesve.com>

Apologies for cross-postings and for the late notice.

Tomorrow, October 16, IBPSA Twin Cities is hosting Dan Katzenberger to speak on the topic of LEED review.  The meeting will be "broadcast" via webinar at this link:

Please register for IBPSA TC: Energy Modeling for LEED - GBCI perspective on Oct 16, 2013 12:00 PM CDT at:

https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/6633224261602677762

We are going to attempt to record the session.

About the presentation and the speaker:

The presentation will be on "GBCI and LEED Reviews from an Insider's Perspective." Dan will cover an overview of GBCI, the LEED review process, how to best interact with USGBC and GBCI, and tips and tricks that will help attendees more successfully navigate the GBCI LEED review process.

Dan Katzenberger is a registered professional engineer, licenced in 17 states, and he has 21 years of experience in commercial building mechanical systems design and computerized energy simulations (starting with DOE 2.1d).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energyplus Schedules and Daylight Saving Time
Message-ID: <CAKKdj8_R6D90+C1BjL53v9RxFHKicNZxvxg=ykfPMM96-DTvcg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

Can someone explain to me why energyplus behaves the way that it does when
daylight saving time is used?

Specifically, scheduled values are shifted in the following way:
In a simulation, during DST, (summer), a schedule with 24 unique values for
a single day will have values [2:24] used during hours 1:23, and value [1]
used during hour 24. The first part seems reasonable, shift scheduled
values back by one hour, but the last part seems wrong, shifting a
scheduled value from hour 1 to hour 24 of the same day.

Since I'm doing controls studies, and I use schedules to define when some
systems are on or off, this issue is particularly troubling. When I intend
for a system to be ON during hour 1 and OFF during hour 2, the schedule is
adjusted by energyplus so that during the simulation the system is OFF
during hour 1, and ON during hour 24...not exactly what I intended.

Have any other users experienced this? Any suggestions for a workaround? I
would like to have DST in effect, so that occupancy, lighting schedules,
equipment schedules, etc. are correct relative to the sun's position and
the local weather conditions - and I would ALSO like for my controls
schedules to be used as intended, not shifted forward or backward, so that
when I schedule a system to be ON during hour 1, it is ON during hour 1,
whether it's winter or summer in simulation.

An example file and complete results are attached; file description and
results sample are included below.

Cheers,
Ryan

----
I've attached an example IDF that demonstrates the issue, as well as the
CSV output, my file is adapted from the example
file: 1ZoneUncontrolledResLayers.idf; I made the following changes:
1. added a RUNPERIODCONTROL:DAYLIGHTSAVINGTIME object that applies DST from
March 5 to November 5
2. added a schedule:compact object called DST_test_schedule
**this schedule has the following format, each hour for each day has a
unique value which should match that day and time; so the value for March
2, hour 5 is 3.0205, the value for March 4, hour 7 is 3.0407, etc.
3. added an output for the above schedule, removed all other outputs
4. removed annual runperiod, added two shorter runperiods that encompass
the DST start and end dates.

In the InputOutputReference, the following note is provided:
----
Note: For EnergyPlus Output:Variable and Output:Meter reporting, the time
stamps are always in standard time. When daylight saving time is active,
scheduled loads and controls will shift one hour relative to standard time.
----
**this is not accurate, since MOST values are shifted (backward) by 1 hour,
but values scheduled during hour 1 are shifted (forward) by 23 hours.

Ryan,
The E+ "hour" value is the hour preceding the value.  e.g., Hour 1 is 00:01 - 1:00
That means if you move everything back one hour, what previously was 00:01 - 01:00 becomes 23:01 - 24:00.  It should not be the same day, but does it make an important difference for two hours out of the year?

Hi Jim,
For my controls investigations, it makes a difference every day during the
DST period, specifically I'm optimizing window open/close schedules for
natural ventilation - and when the windows open at hour 24 instead of hour
1, on a given day (say, on a day x it's a good idea to open windows at hour
1, and a bad idea to open them at hour 24) it really screws with my
results.

For a generic repeating schedule, i agree that it doesn't make much
difference in an annual simulation, but i'm looking at specific days, and
sometimes using actual weather data - so it really is important that i get
the controls implemented on the right day, at the right time.

Thanks for your help,
Ryan

Ryan,
How about setting Daylight Savings to OFF, then build your operation schedules to (manually) offset during DST?

Hi Jim,
For my controls investigations, it makes a difference every day during the DST period, specifically I'm optimizing window open/close schedules for natural ventilation - and when the windows open at hour 24 instead of hour 1, on a given day (say, on a day x it's a good idea to open windows at hour 1, and a bad idea to open them at hour 24) it really screws with my results.

For a generic repeating schedule, i agree that it doesn't make much difference in an annual simulation, but i'm looking at specific days, and sometimes using actual weather data - so it really is important that i get the controls implemented on the right day, at the right time.

Thanks for your help,
Ryan

Ryan,
The E+ "hour" value is the hour preceding the value.  e.g., Hour 1 is 00:01 - 1:00
That means if you move everything back one hour, what previously was 00:01 - 01:00 becomes 23:01 - 24:00.  It should not be the same day, but does it make an important difference for two hours out of the year?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energyplus Schedules and Daylight Saving Time

Greetings,

Can someone explain to me why energyplus behaves the way that it does when daylight saving time is used?

Specifically, scheduled values are shifted in the following way:
In a simulation, during DST, (summer), a schedule with 24 unique values for a single day will have values [2:24] used during hours 1:23, and value [1] used during hour 24. The first part seems reasonable, shift scheduled values back by one hour, but the last part seems wrong, shifting a scheduled value from hour 1 to hour 24 of the same day.

Since I'm doing controls studies, and I use schedules to define when some systems are on or off, this issue is particularly troubling. When I intend for a system to be ON during hour 1 and OFF during hour 2, the schedule is adjusted by energyplus so that during the simulation the system is OFF during hour 1, and ON during hour 24...not exactly what I intended.

Have any other users experienced this? Any suggestions for a workaround? I would like to have DST in effect, so that occupancy, lighting schedules, equipment schedules, etc. are correct relative to the sun's position and the local weather conditions - and I would ALSO like for my controls schedules to be used as intended, not shifted forward or backward, so that when I schedule a system to be ON during hour 1, it is ON during hour 1, whether it's winter or summer in simulation.

An example file and complete results are attached; file description and results sample are included below.

Cheers,
Ryan

----
I've attached an example IDF that demonstrates the issue, as well as the CSV output, my file is adapted from the example file: 1ZoneUncontrolledResLayers.idf; I made the following changes:
1. added a RUNPERIODCONTROL:DAYLIGHTSAVINGTIME object that applies DST from March 5 to November 5
2. added a schedule:compact object called DST_test_schedule
**this schedule has the following format, each hour for each day has a unique value which should match that day and time; so the value for March 2, hour 5 is 3.0205, the value for March 4, hour 7 is 3.0407, etc.
3. added an output for the above schedule, removed all other outputs
4. removed annual runperiod, added two shorter runperiods that encompass the DST start and end dates.

In the InputOutputReference, the following note is provided:
----
Note: For EnergyPlus Output:Variable and Output:Meter reporting, the time stamps are always in standard time. When daylight saving time is active, scheduled loads and controls will shift one hour relative to standard time.
----
**this is not accurate, since MOST values are shifted (backward) by 1 hour, but values scheduled during hour 1 are shifted (forward) by 23 hours.

Jim,

Another example: suppose a building needs 8 hours to pre-cool before
occupancy on a Monday in order to meet comfort requirements, and the
cooling system is off on weekends. With the current energyplus DST
schedule-shifting, your building will only get 7-hours of pre-cooling on
Monday morning, and will get an extra hour of cooling on Friday night.

schedule might look something like:
For: Weekdays,
Until: 8:00,
1,
Until: 24,
0,
For: Weekends,
Until: 24:00,
0,

Interesting findings Ryan. 

I'm also working with Daylight Saving Time in EnergyPlus because we're doing hourly calibration on short run period. If I understand well, the results from your csv file should be

 03/05  23:00:00, 3.0524

 03/05  24:00:00, 3.0601

 03/06  01:00:00, 3.0602

Instead of

 03/05  23:00:00, 3.0524

 03/05  24:00:00, 3.0501

 03/06  01:00:00, 3.0602

 

I agree this could be problematic if schedule values differs from 24h to 1h.

I tested differently.  Instead of using a compact schedule definition as you did, I used a Schedule:File object using the same naming value as you proposed (See attached scheduleFile attached). I taught that maybe the wording (Throught : mm/dd) in compact schedule definition could be the cause. But no, It react the same... With Schedule:file object definition, I got also

 03/05  23:00:00, 3.0524

 03/05  24:00:00, 3.0501

 03/06  01:00:00, 3.0602

Jim,

 

Another example: suppose a building needs 8 hours to pre-cool before occupancy on a Monday in order to meet comfort requirements, and the cooling system is off on weekends. With the current energyplus DST schedule-shifting, your building will only get 7-hours of pre-cooling on Monday morning, and will get an extra hour of cooling on Friday night.

 

schedule might look something like:

For: Weekdays,

Until: 8:00,

1,

Until: 24,

0,

For: Weekends,

Until: 24:00,

0,

...

Hi Jim,

For my controls investigations, it makes a difference every day during the DST period, specifically I'm optimizing window open/close schedules for natural ventilation - and when the windows open at hour 24 instead of hour 1, on a given day (say, on a day x it's a good idea to open windows at hour 1, and a bad idea to open them at hour 24) it really screws with my results. 

 

For a generic repeating schedule, i agree that it doesn't make much difference in an annual simulation, but i'm looking at specific days, and sometimes using actual weather data - so it really is important that i get the controls implemented on the right day, at the right time.

 

Thanks for your help,

Ryan

Ryan,

The E+ "hour" value is the hour preceding the value.  e.g., Hour 1 is 00:01 - 1:00

That means if you move everything back one hour, what previously was 00:01 - 01:00 becomes 23:01 - 24:00.  It should not be the same day, but does it make an important difference for two hours out of the year?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energyplus Schedules and Daylight Saving Time

 

Greetings,

 

Can someone explain to me why energyplus behaves the way that it does when daylight saving time is used?

 

Specifically, scheduled values are shifted in the following way:

In a simulation, during DST, (summer), a schedule with 24 unique values for a single day will have values [2:24] used during hours 1:23, and value [1] used during hour 24. The first part seems reasonable, shift scheduled values back by one hour, but the last part seems wrong, shifting a scheduled value from hour 1 to hour 24 of the same day. 


 

Since I'm doing controls studies, and I use schedules to define when some systems are on or off, this issue is particularly troubling. When I intend for a system to be ON during hour 1 and OFF during hour 2, the schedule is adjusted by energyplus so that during the simulation the system is OFF during hour 1, and ON during hour 24...not exactly what I intended.

 

Have any other users experienced this? Any suggestions for a workaround? I would like to have DST in effect, so that occupancy, lighting schedules, equipment schedules, etc. are correct relative to the sun's position and the local weather conditions - and I would ALSO like for my controls schedules to be used as intended, not shifted forward or backward, so that when I schedule a system to be ON during hour 1, it is ON during hour 1, whether it's winter or summer in simulation.

 

An example file and complete results are attached; file description and results sample are included below.

 

Cheers,

Ryan

 

----

I've attached an example IDF that demonstrates the issue, as well as the CSV output, my file is adapted from the example file: 1ZoneUncontrolledResLayers.idf; I made the following changes:

1. added a RUNPERIODCONTROL:DAYLIGHTSAVINGTIME object that applies DST from March 5 to November 5

2. added a schedule:compact object called DST_test_schedule

**this schedule has the following format, each hour for each day has a unique value which should match that day and time; so the value for March 2, hour 5 is 3.0205, the value for March 4, hour 7 is 3.0407, etc.

3. added an output for the above schedule, removed all other outputs

4. removed annual runperiod, added two shorter runperiods that encompass the DST start and end dates.

 

In the InputOutputReference, the following note is provided: 

----

Note: For EnergyPlus Output:Variable and Output:Meter reporting, the time stamps are always in standard time. When daylight saving time is active, scheduled loads and controls will shift one hour relative to standard time.

----

**this is not accurate, since MOST values are shifted (backward) by 1 hour, but values scheduled during hour 1 are shifted (forward) by 23 hours.

BLDG-simers -

The University of Idaho Integrated Design Lab is happy to announce that we've posted a new, free EnergyPlus tool to our website and we'd love your feedback.

https://sites.google.com/site/idlbsug/modeling-resources/idf-objects/uiidl_hvac-template-generator

The tool is an OpenOffice, macro-enabled spreadsheet that will generate the required text objects for the various HVAC template systems available to EnergyPlus.  The tool also allows batch input of multiple objects to help streamline the specification of large models with numerous zones.  Give it a try!   The page also includes an instructional YouTube video on how to use the tool.

Please post comments, or email me with questions, suggestions, or thoughts!  Hope you like the tool and find it to be useful!

Cheers!

Hi All,

We need to collect data for a complete building modelling project from building owners that are not very familiar with the subject. We already have access to various more or less personal input forms, with no or very cursory descriptions of each data item. I expect almost every modeler and company has their own.

What I am looking for is a template where each data item is explained and more carefully defined (in English). It seems to be the sort of thing that must have been developed by, e.g., ASHRAE at some point (and I should probably be well aware of :-).

Gratefully,

Per

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Building input data template

 

Hi All,

 

We need to collect data for a complete building modelling project from
building owners that are not very familiar with the subject. We already have
access to various more or less personal input forms, with no or very cursory
descriptions of each data item. I expect almost every modeler and company
has their own. 

 

What I am looking for is a template where each data item is explained and
more carefully defined (in English). It seems to be the sort of thing that
must have been developed by, e.g., ASHRAE at some point (and I should
probably be well aware of :-).

 

Gratefully,

 

Per

Dear all,
Does anyone of you know a software program which I can use to calculate the energy needs of a building (installed power) at an early stage (design). With the usual programs like EnergyPlus or Trnsys you need to insert a lot of parameters to get the information, parameters which  just aren?t allways available in the design stage.
The calculations don?t have to be very precise, I?m looking for a tool which can give an acceptable result, so we can give our customer an idea of how much power is needed for a certain building.

Greatfully,
Jens Wagemakers (The Netherlands)

Bentley Systems' AECOsim Energy Simulator has a conceptual mode - about 10 inputs (mostly from drop-down boxes), draw the outline of the footprint, select from a dozen preconfigured HVAC system (drag-and-drop components, all 90.1 required baseline and budget systems), and simulate.  And it uses EnergyPlus.  Once your conceptual model is ready, you can modify all the default parameters.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Accumulation stove
Message-ID: <007801cecfda$89cda920$9d68fb60$@put.poznan.pl>

Dear All,

 

Dou you have some experience with modeling accumulation stove in buildings.

 

I think about stove which is driven by electricity or biomass, similar to
titled stove (attachment).

 

I think about two ways to simulate it:

1)      Zone heat gain,

2)      Walls with temperature as boundary condition (temperature of the
stove surface)

 

What do you think about this idea?

 

There is also issue, how can I model the  heat generation in stove to take
into account accumulation and dependence on biomass burning? 

 

Kind regards,

Karol

Hello,

If by energy need you are referring to energy consumption (Wh), I would suggest to go with RETScreen. 
If you are referring to cooling/heating loads (W) try Design Builder. 
Downside is that you can't get block load for entire building. (Maybe this issue is resolved with newer version).
HAP can also do the job.

Another option to consider, if you are already familiar with Sketchup, is the free IES-VE Ware plugin.  Similar in function to what's been described for AECOSim, but from my experience I'll caution you WILL want to plan on time to create the model from scratch.

Hi Jens,

I would support Sasa's recommendation to consider DesignBuilder for the application you have suggested, adding that you can easily do both loads calculations and simulations to determine power and energy consumption from the various energy systems in the building such as HVAC, lighting and equipment. You can create the building geometry and define internal gains, HVAC (via simplified schematic drag-and-drop or menu options) etc. quickly and easily for early-stage analysis (there are many free online tutorials showing how to do this), and then develop the complexity of it as your design matures.

Regards,

Dave

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Accounting for plenums/technical ceilings
Message-ID: <CAPAgWczXEdaTEUQWfVb3XzKSumofFGuF9vqy--krisxBj1i5Fg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

How do people generally account for plenums or technical ceilings? I'm not
referring here to plenums used for air circulation, but closed ceiling
space that is not considered as part of a volume to heat or cool for load
calculations.

- Do you model them as separate spaces?
- Do you ignore them (but how then do you preserve the building's geometry)?
- Some other option?
- And for those using EnergyPlus, do you use the "ceiling height" field of
the Zone object? The documentation says that this generates a warning if
the ceiling height and calculated ceiling height differ too much, whatever
too much is.

The building I'm working on has a 1.1 m (3.6 ft)  difference between the
space ceiling height and the height of the floor above, so it's not
something I can ignore.

Thanks for your feedback,
Patrick

Some of you may know that I use EnergyPro for this sort of thing.  You 
can build a very simple building if you want to.  A box.  Window area.  
Internal people and lighting.  If it is multi-story you can multiply the 
floors, just like EQuest and the rest.

I suppose the most important thing is the weather file, and EnergyPro 
has many to choose from, and everywhere in California where I work.  For 
me, in California, it is the obvious choice.

Bentley Systems' AECOsim Energy Simulator has a conceptual mode - about 10 inputs (mostly from drop-down boxes), draw the outline of the footprint, select from a dozen preconfigured HVAC system (drag-and-drop components, all 90.1 required baseline and budget systems), and simulate.  And it uses EnergyPlus.  Once your conceptual model is ready, you can modify all the default parameters.

Dear all,
Does anyone of you know a software program which I can use to calculate the energy needs of a building (installed power) at an early stage (design). With the usual programs like EnergyPlus or Trnsys you need to insert a lot of parameters to get the information, parameters which  just aren't allways available in the design stage.
The calculations don't have to be very precise, I'm looking for a tool which can give an acceptable result, so we can give our customer an idea of how much power is needed for a certain building.

Greatfully,

Hello Patrick,
The plenum areas of the building certainly need to be taken into account in the model and there are cooling and heating loads associatiated with plenums even if they are not conditioned. While they may not be used as a return plenum, there will still be a heat transfer between the plenum and all of the adjacent surfaces, especially the exterior wall and the ceiling. These heat transfers can also affect the occupied space load as there is an exchange through the ceiling. To answer your first question, plenums are typically modeled as separate spaces, yes. The height of the plenum should equal the floor to floor height minus the ceiling height. All of the math should add up so that the exterior wall heat transfers are correctly accounted for.

I recommend consulting the ASHRAE 90.1 users manual for more information on accounting for different definitions of spaces and partition types.

Cheers,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Accounting for plenums/technical ceilings

Hi all,

How do people generally account for plenums or technical ceilings? I'm not referring here to plenums used for air circulation, but closed ceiling space that is not considered as part of a volume to heat or cool for load calculations.

- Do you model them as separate spaces?
- Do you ignore them (but how then do you preserve the building's geometry)?
- Some other option?
- And for those using EnergyPlus, do you use the "ceiling height" field of the Zone object? The documentation says that this generates a warning if the ceiling height and calculated ceiling height differ too much, whatever too much is.

The building I'm working on has a 1.1 m (3.6 ft)  difference between the space ceiling height and the height of the floor above, so it's not something I can ignore.

Thanks for your feedback,
Patrick

All,
This has been a great thread.  My experience has been that the early stage
models for building orientation and envelope optimization are not of much
use, other than the insight gained from the exercise, when you move from
that phase of the project to system sizing and equipment selection during
the design phase, whether your are working with a manual input workflow
into a simulation tool or trying to automate the input through Sketchup,
Revit, Bentley, ArchiCAD, etc.  Load calculations, equipment sizing, air
distribution system device and distribution system design and selection
pretty much demand room-by-room analysis.  Its hard to take conceptual
models, exterior surface area models, massing and "shoe-box" models and
grow them into room-by-room models using the same original input files.
 I'm very interested in what you all have to say about this process and
does any of these tools make the transition from concept to full blown
design any less painfull?
Dennis

I agree with Dennis.  Typically the design evolves so much between the need for conceptual modeling and the more discrete system sizing modeling, I end up building a new model.  With that in mind, I still think the eQuest wizards are the easiest and quickest way to run conceptual model options.  Then I move to IES VE for my more detailed modeling.

Fyi.

In DOE-2-based simulations modeling a plenum can have +- issues. For example if you model a space as a plenum then the loads in/out of the space do not show in LOADS only in SYSTEMS as a heat gain/loss to/from the plenum only when the air is flowing in the plenum. Also, there is no thermostat setting for the plenum and the load is not included in the sum of space loads.

On the other hand if you model it as an unconditioned zone then you can see the floating temperature, but it is not conditioned.

Finally, you can also model it as a space with a wider dead band so the system never comes on/off.

So, either way has its pros and cons.

This is easy to test with the SAMP1e.inp file that is distributed with DOE-2.

For very simple and fast schematic and concetual performance analysis I
recomend Project Vasari, which is free and specially designed for energy
analysis in early stages.

Its simulation engine is DOE 2, and you can export equest and e+ input
files for later more detailed analysis. Another usefull caracteristic is
automated results representation and cloud parametric analysis of 50 design
alternatives every time you simulate, determining the impact on energy of
the different parameters compared the original design.

Hope it helps

Karol,

 

I haven?t modeled such a stove myself, but here are my thoughts for what
they?re worth.  While explicit modeling of an accumulation stove would be
very complex, I think that approximating one in an energy model is
reasonable.  It is essentially just a radiant/convective source of direct
heat in the space, with some sort of fuel input and efficiency associated
with it.  For the discussion below, I?ll assume the fuel is biomass.  

 

If I were doing this I would model it as an electric resistance heater in
the room, with an efficiency applied to it that reflects the average
efficiency of the stove.  I don?t know about other programs, but in TRACE it
is possible to apply an efficiency to electric resistance heating.  Other
programs may assume 100% efficiency for resistance heat, in which case you
would have to do a little bit of additional calculation outside the program.
I would take the heating energy usage calculated by the program and convert
from kWh to lbs of wood or whatever measure of the biomass fuel you choose.
This would require some research on the energy density of the fuel.  

 

There are a few key factors to consider:

 

1.       Efficiency.  In a woodstove, this is a moving target, depending on
how dry the fuel is, how much combustion air is available, how hot the fire
is allowed to burn, and the inherent characteristics of the stove.  In
considering efficiency, you should consider combustion efficiency, latent
heat loss due to moisture in the fuel, and sensible losses up the flue.

2.       Combustion air.  The stove needs combustion air.  This will most
likely come in the form of infiltration into the space.  Wood needs about 12
ft? of combustion air for each 1000 BTU of input fuel energy.  It is not
unreasonable to expect the stove to use around 100% excess air.  That means
that for every 1000 BTUs of input fuel used, you need to account for about
24 ft? of infiltration into the space.  

3.       Stove operation.  Will the stove be operated to maintain a steady
indoor temperature 24 hours per day?  If so you can just give the room a
single set point temperature.  If the stove operation will be more
intermittent, you may need to create a temperature set point schedule which
reflects the actual temperature fluctuations in the space.  

4.       Thermal mass.  The mass of the stove serves to even out its heat
output over the course of several hours.  Without modeling the inner
workings of the stove explicitly, I think this effect can be
approximated/estimated using the set point temperature schedule mentioned
above.   

5.       Is there another heating system serving the same space?  If so,
then my suggestions don?t apply as cleanly, if at all.

 

I should say that I?m not a biomass expert.  I?m just interested in the
topic.  The information I provide about wood combustion are based on
documents I?ve read from the Masonry Heater Association and elsewhere.

 

I hope this helps,

Christian

Dear All,

 

Dou you have some experience with modeling accumulation stove in buildings.

 

I think about stove which is driven by electricity or biomass, similar to
titled stove (attachment).

 

I think about two ways to simulate it:

1)      Zone heat gain,

2)      Walls with temperature as boundary condition (temperature of the
stove surface)

 

What do you think about this idea?

 

There is also issue, how can I model the  heat generation in stove to take
into account accumulation and dependence on biomass burning? 

 

Kind regards,

Karol

 "Buildings" library and version 1.3.0 of the "BuildingsPy" Python package
Message-ID: <CACXXVchxo2PTfz8z7dtS8rhj5VZ_8_nEoMpx3Khzfeoaw8jT3g@mail.gmail.com>

LBNL releases version 1.5 build 1 of the Modelica "Buildings" library and
version 1.3.0 of the "BuildingsPy" Python package.

Version 1.5 build 1 is a major release that contains new packages with
models for solar collectors and for the Facility for Low Energy Experiments
(FLEXLAB) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

This release also contains a major revision of all info sections to correct
invalid html syntax. The package Buildings.HeatTransfer.Radiosity has been
revised to fully comply with the Modelica language specification. This
release also contains various corrections that avoid warnings during
translation when used with Modelica 3.2.1. (By default, Modelica 3.2 is
used, but the library is compatible with Modelica 3.2.1.) Various models
have been revised to increase compatibility with OpenModelica. However,
currently only a subset of the models work with OpenModelica.

For a detailed list of changes, see
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/v1.5+build.1/help/Buildings_UsersGuide_ReleaseNotes.html

In BuildingsPy 1.3.0, stricter tests for running the unit tests have been
implemented. The unit tests now check for better conformance with the
Modelica Language Specification. They also validate the html syntax of the
Modelica documentation. The package DyMat that is used by BuildingsPy to
read Dymola output files has been updated to the latest version.

guidelines Shanta directed me to:

I guess the part I'm interested in is acceptable simplifications. And
perhaps modelling tricks, that might be software specific.

Now a bit of context. I'm working on a 40 storey high building. That's
quite a few plenums to model, which add a lot of surfaces simply by being
there and by breaking up spaces that could have been grouped vertically
into continuous thermal zones. I was wondering if there was a better way of
approaching this to keep the model simple and the surface count down. Or do
I just have to suck it up?

An example of simplification I thought of, with EnergyPlus, is to model
space and plenum as a single space but setting the Ceiling Height field of
the Zone object to the height below plenum. It's acceptable in terms of air
changes in the space according to the documentation. It removes a lot of
surfaces and allows to group spaces into continuous vertical thermal zones.
But a part of the heat transfers through external walls that would normally
affect the plenum will be accounted for in the space itself. Acceptable
simplification? Unnecessary optimisation?

Thanks,
Patrick

I've been reading the postings on this thread, but have resisted chiming 
in until now :-)

Although modeling a plenum is appealing from the point of physical 
verisimilitude, there are actually some drawbacks depending on which 
simulation program is being used.  With DOE-2, adding a plenum on the 
top floor converts the ceiling to an internal surface, for which DOE-2 
models only conductive heat flows, thus losing the direct radiant 
exchange between the roof bottom and ceiling top.  I'm still 
investigating the impact this has on the simulations, but the 
preliminary indications are that it underestimates the impact of 
measures affecting the roof reflectivity, such as a "Cool Roof".

The other thought I have is that while the COMNET description quoted 
below is physically correct, much of it (stratification, leakage through 
the ceiling, etc.) are ignored in the building simulations.  For all 
intensive purposes, a plenum in DOE-2 or EnergyPlus is simply an 
unconditioned or a partially conditioned zone if it contains ducts (and 
the ducts are modeled).

As far as modeling tricks, adding a plenum to DOE-2 or eQUEST does not 
add much of a modeling burden if a FLOOR-MULTIPLIER is used to describe 
a typical floor + plenum.  Similarly, with EnergyPlus, you can create a 
ZoneList containing all the spaces on one floor plus a plenum above, and 
then give the Zone List a multiplier.

If you want to omit the plenum, I would still make the exterior wall 
area include the plenum height, but maybe reduce the air volume of the 
space as you've described.  I know that's not a problem in DOE-2, but I 
don't know whether EnergyPlus would allow you to do so, i.e., the input 
zone volume is less than that enclosed by the surfaces.  I don't think 
you'll go terribly wrong, but I would still think that having a plenum 
would be preferable.

Jens,
Target Finder and Portfolio manager are great tools with a rich set of data
behind them.  Bear in mind that they are based on statistical analysis of
2003 CBECS reference data and are going to return total annual numbers -
not something like monthly consumption and peak demand. Those tools do not
make assumptions about occupancy, schedules, equipment, etc.  They also do
not make any assumptions about the activities that may be present in your
design or proposed building.  The tools normalize the data from their
reference database based on your design inputs to generate a median EUI and
either a score or target EUI for your building or proposed design.  We've
done some modeling of about half of the DOE reference buildings in all 16
climate zones to see if a model can be tuned/calibrated to mimic the output
from Target Finder and Portfolio Manager for a median building.  Since
occupancy, schedule, activity, fuel mix, climate zone, ventilation,
envelope characteristics all have an impact you can chase your tail for a
long time trying to get a precise match.  We've also done some sensitivity
analysis on those variables across climate zones. Depending on climate
zone, any one of those variable can swing the numbers significantly off the
median.  Then there is the issue of site versus source EUI's.  In some of
our analysis the numbers for some buildings and climate zones correlate
closely with site numbers and in others with the source EUI numbers.  If
you are wanting to provide your client with at least high level decision
making information on total energy annual consumption and maximum peak
demand for all your fuel sources I think you still need a baseline model.
 That model can be as simple as four walls, a roof, some basic schedules
and setpoints.  Most of the tools allow you to set that up fairly quickly.
 The difficulty I've noted on a previous post to this question is that
often this early stage model is not able to evolve into a design phase
model without significant modification and it is often just as easy to
create a new design level model.
Dennis

I agree too.   Models that can change as the design evolve are a huge challenge.

In presentations I give on challenges of doing energy simulation, I describe a corporate HQ project that I worked on (a LONG time ago).  We started in predesign, looking shape - a very long linear building that we rotated and did a number of simulations on shape.  By schematic design the building had changed to L-shaped... more simulations...  When we got to conceptual design that become an H.  In design development, the owner decided to incorporate a 50 kW data center. By the end of construction documents, the building was X-shaped with a central atrium...  Keeping up with these changes throughout design is a real challenge.  About all that stays the same are your space types, the location, and maybe some other settings.

I agree with Dennis.  Typically the design evolves so much between the need for conceptual modeling and the more discrete system sizing modeling, I end up building a new model.  With that in mind, I still think the eQuest wizards are the easiest and quickest way to run conceptual model options.  Then I move to IES VE for my more detailed modeling.

All,
This has been a great thread.  My experience has been that the early stage models for building orientation and envelope optimization are not of much use, other than the insight gained from the exercise, when you move from that phase of the project to system sizing and equipment selection during the design phase, whether your are working with a manual input workflow into a simulation tool or trying to automate the input through Sketchup, Revit, Bentley, ArchiCAD, etc.  Load calculations, equipment sizing, air distribution system device and distribution system design and selection pretty much demand room-by-room analysis.  Its hard to take conceptual models, exterior surface area models, massing and "shoe-box" models and grow them into room-by-room models using the same original input files.  I'm very interested in what you all have to say about this process and does any of these tools make the transition from concept to full blown design any less painfull?
Dennis

Bentley Systems' AECOsim Energy Simulator has a conceptual mode - about 10 inputs (mostly from drop-down boxes), draw the outline of the footprint, select from a dozen preconfigured HVAC system (drag-and-drop components, all 90.1 required baseline and budget systems), and simulate.  And it uses EnergyPlus.  Once your conceptual model is ready, you can modify all the default parameters.

Dear all,
Does anyone of you know a software program which I can use to calculate the energy needs of a building (installed power) at an early stage (design). With the usual programs like EnergyPlus or Trnsys you need to insert a lot of parameters to get the information, parameters which  just aren't allways available in the design stage.
The calculations don't have to be very precise, I'm looking for a tool which can give an acceptable result, so we can give our customer an idea of how much power is needed for a certain building.

Greatfully,

1.       Came to learn about plenums.

2.       Learned the phrase "physical verisimilitude."

3.       Will be spending the rest of the day digging for an excuse to slip this phrase into everyday conversation....

Thanks, Joe!

The implications for rooftop radiant exchange are intriguing by the way and could immediately impact a few current projects of mine... Would be interested to learn the results of your investigation!

More to the original topic, I agree there's more than one right answer with respect to liberties of simplification a modeler can reasonably leverage.  So long as you do account for the corresponding perimeter envelope loads and are mindful of the conditioned volume, I think you're on solid ground in many cases to omit the plenums explicitly.  On the flip side (speaking specifically to the eQuest interface), especially if you are using floor multipliers, you'd likely spend much less time actually modeling the plenums.

For further reading, the [equest-users] archives have many threads discussing plenums, interstitial floors, and heat transfer implications.  You might pick up some new ideas and food for thought there ;).

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Accounting for plenums/technical ceilings

I've been reading the postings on this thread, but have resisted chiming in until now :-)

Although modeling a plenum is appealing from the point of physical verisimilitude, there are actually some drawbacks depending on which simulation program is being used.  With DOE-2, adding a plenum on the top floor converts the ceiling to an internal surface, for which DOE-2 models only conductive heat flows, thus losing the direct radiant exchange between the roof bottom and ceiling top.  I'm still investigating the impact this has on the simulations, but the preliminary indications are that it underestimates the impact of measures affecting the roof reflectivity, such as a "Cool Roof".

The other thought I have is that while the COMNET description quoted below is physically correct, much of it (stratification, leakage through the ceiling, etc.) are ignored in the building simulations.  For all intensive purposes, a plenum in DOE-2 or EnergyPlus is simply an unconditioned or a partially conditioned zone if it contains ducts (and the ducts are modeled).

As far as modeling tricks, adding a plenum to DOE-2 or eQUEST does not add much of a modeling burden if a FLOOR-MULTIPLIER is used to describe a typical floor + plenum.  Similarly, with EnergyPlus, you can create a ZoneList containing all the spaces on one floor plus a plenum above, and then give the Zone List a multiplier.

If you want to omit the plenum, I would still make the exterior wall area include the plenum height, but maybe reduce the air volume of the space as you've described.  I know that's not a problem in DOE-2, but I don't know whether EnergyPlus would allow you to do so, i.e., the input zone volume is less than that enclosed by the surfaces.  I don't think you'll go terribly wrong, but I would still think that having a plenum would be preferable.

It is generally recommended that plenums be modeled as separate thermal blocks, but at the modeler's
discretion, they may be combined with conditioned space below for modeling simplicity.

I guess the part I'm interested in is acceptable simplifications. And perhaps modelling tricks, that might be software specific.

Now a bit of context. I'm working on a 40 storey high building. That's quite a few plenums to model, which add a lot of surfaces simply by being there and by breaking up spaces that could have been grouped vertically into continuous thermal zones. I was wondering if there was a better way of approaching this to keep the model simple and the surface count down. Or do I just have to suck it up?

An example of simplification I thought of, with EnergyPlus, is to model space and plenum as a single space but setting the Ceiling Height field of the Zone object to the height below plenum. It's acceptable in terms of air changes in the space according to the documentation. It removes a lot of surfaces and allows to group spaces into continuous vertical thermal zones. But a part of the heat transfers through external walls that would normally affect the plenum will be accounted for in the space itself. Acceptable simplification? Unnecessary optimisation?

Thanks,
Patrick

For ceiling plenums under conditioned spaces or well insulated roofs, I generally agree that they are not worth the effort.  Whenever I try to get smarter about modeling plenums I come back to the lack of information on plenums in 90.1 ECB and Appendix G.   These are clearly design decision but how should they be accounted for.  It is a strategy to have a plenum, to have ducted returns, to have recessed lighting, etc?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] method for extracting transmissivity from thermal
	comfort results
Message-ID: <CAOQXAFCnrDEWn3it8Pi2ygU_fARh=kVv5BavDfgpJAXk1dSe1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm hoping to find a method that can be implemented in Excel for extracting
a glazing transmittance from two or more sets of temperature results.

*Our problem:*
We assess simulated comfort criteria where operative temperatures in a zone
above 27degC must be in the 1%-ile or less. We extract a *glazing
transmission* that will 'only just' meet this criterion from two or more
sets of results. We have limited access to parametric runs, hence only two
or more sets of thermal modelling results.

*What we've used up to now:*
In order to 'roughly' evaluate the solar transmissivity that helps achieve
this criterion we have used TREND and other functions for curve fitting in
excel to interpolate a transmissivity from two or more sets of results.

We have two problems with this approach:
1. such a narrow band of results are being focused on so the calc is
subject to inaccuracies
2. our modelling software is limited to one hour timesteps and can only
report temperatures in 1 degree intervals

*Possible solution?*
My gut fee is that we can extract the information more reliably from a
broader band of data. Is there an approach that looks at the spread of
temperature distribution from, say, 25 to 28 degC for two or more result
sets and extracts the transmissivity that matches the 1%-ile.

*Is there such a method?*

Minor note: We limit changes to glazing absorptance between our parametric
runs, aiming for only changes in transmissivity and reflectance. We have
found operative temperatures to increase with higher glazing absorptance.

Best regards

Chris

Dr.Benny,



You can try with Riyadh weather file which seems closer to Doha in below link.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] New Rules of Thumb for Design Loads
Message-ID: <002801ced4a7$af043ac0$0d0cb040$@sudassociates.com>

Hello Group,

Does anyone know of any articles/papers/publications which address peak
design loads for buildings as energy codes evolve?  I am looking for basic
rules of thumb for sf/ton (cooling) and btuh/sf (heating).  People use these
rules of thumb all the time for initial assessments, sanity checks on
simulation results, etc, but I'm not sure that the rules of thumb are being
updated as energy codes become more aggressive.  For example, the engineers
I have been around since I entered the engineering world (granted, that was
only a few years ago) seem to always go back to 400 sf/ton as a standard
value, then adjust up or down depending on building characteristics.  I
haven't seen this  number change as buildings improve, or as I move to
different climate zones.  To be clear, I am interested in design loads, not
annual energy usage.

(Note:  Before anyone lambasts me for even bringing up rules of thumb for
design, I'll go ahead and say that I know they are gross estimations at
best, and should be used with extreme caution and judgment.  Nonetheless, I
see them used all the time, so I might as well get as good numbers as I can.
And a project I am on right now actually requires it (by owner) in
preliminary design.)

Thanks for your help,
Christian

Dear Christian,
I do not know of any such resources!  
What do you think about creating a "typical" building and trying out various envelope, lighting, plug load and HVAC options in your climate to see the impact of each? That should not be too daunting a task.

Jim,

Thanks.  Yes, I can do my own little study, and I can also just look back at
results from past projects.  That's a good suggestion.  But I was hoping to
have something credible to reference (outside my own firm) for the owner.  I
have seen DOE/National Lab comparisons of annual energy usage between the
different versions of 90.1...I was hoping there might be something similar
for design loads.

Thanks,
Christian

Christian,
I suspect that you and your company are very credible and shouldn't hesitate to claim the truth of that.  Your client probably would not have retained you if that were not true!  It would be nice to have a 1000 building study from DOE, though :)
I wonder why your client is asking?  There are so many design possibilities and at the end of the day, design load affects only equipment size (including the electricity and fuel services).  These, in turn, can be "managed" by choices for insulation, lighting, etc.  
Another thing to consider (after assessing your firm's liability from lawsuits) is that design loads occur infrequently in most climates, so much so that a full energy model analysis can sometimes show that the impact on comfort is minimal for a nominally UNDERsized HVAC system.
It's a tangled web!  I think I'd ask the basis of their concern about peak load.

Don't the DOE reference buildings sort of fit that bill?   16 building types/16 climate zone?

I looked at the results for small office for Baltimore and was able to calculate 650 ft2/ton for cooling.... and I see enough data to do similar for heating, peak demand, etc.

You could use the DOE reference buildings, although these are not "designed" buildings, they only exist in model space...so as a designer I wouldn't use the peak loads necessarily, but maybe the ratio of peak load would be interesting across the code versions.

David, Dru, Jim,

Thanks.  I will consider the DOE reference buildings as an option, at least
for comparison.

Jim, to answer your questions without getting into project details...We have
been asked to give our opinion on the expected loads for a proposed building
so the owner can have an idea of what impact it will have on their central
plants.  We'll do this based primarily on similar past projects of ours.
However, the owner has an on-site engineer who is using very old ASHRAE
documentation to come up with his own (very high) design load estimates.
Apparently ASHRAE used to publish sf/ton guidance for office buildings?  I
would like to have some more current documentation to show the engineer to
help support my explanation of why our prediction will be lower than his.
Also, I think my wording concerning credibility came out wrong.  I certainly
wasn't implying that my company isn't highly capable/credible.  But it's
always nice to have a DOE report as backup documentation!

Thanks for your help,
Christian

Christian,
I suspect that you and your company are very credible and shouldn't hesitate
to claim the truth of that.  Your client probably would not have retained
you if that were not true!  It would be nice to have a 1000 building study
from DOE, though :) I wonder why your client is asking?  There are so many
design possibilities and at the end of the day, design load affects only
equipment size (including the electricity and fuel services).  These, in
turn, can be "managed" by choices for insulation, lighting, etc.  
Another thing to consider (after assessing your firm's liability from
lawsuits) is that design loads occur infrequently in most climates, so much
so that a full energy model analysis can sometimes show that the impact on
comfort is minimal for a nominally UNDERsized HVAC system.
It's a tangled web!  I think I'd ask the basis of their concern about peak
load.

Jim,

Thanks.  Yes, I can do my own little study, and I can also just look back at
results from past projects.  That's a good suggestion.  But I was hoping to
have something credible to reference (outside my own firm) for the owner.  I
have seen DOE/National Lab comparisons of annual energy usage between the
different versions of 90.1...I was hoping there might be something similar
for design loads.

Dear Christian,
I do not know of any such resources!  
What do you think about creating a "typical" building and trying out various
envelope, lighting, plug load and HVAC options in your climate to see the
impact of each? That should not be too daunting a task.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] New Rules of Thumb for Design Loads

Hello Group,

Does anyone know of any articles/papers/publications which address peak
design loads for buildings as energy codes evolve?  I am looking for basic
rules of thumb for sf/ton (cooling) and btuh/sf (heating).  People use these
rules of thumb all the time for initial assessments, sanity checks on
simulation results, etc, but I'm not sure that the rules of thumb are being
updated as energy codes become more aggressive.  For example, the engineers
I have been around since I entered the engineering world (granted, that was
only a few years ago) seem to always go back to 400 sf/ton as a standard
value, then adjust up or down depending on building characteristics.  I
haven't seen this  number change as buildings improve, or as I move to
different climate zones.  To be clear, I am interested in design loads, not
annual energy usage.

(Note:  Before anyone lambasts me for even bringing up rules of thumb for
design, I'll go ahead and say that I know they are gross estimations at
best, and should be used with extreme caution and judgment.  Nonetheless, I
see them used all the time, so I might as well get as good numbers as I can.
And a project I am on right now actually requires it (by owner) in
preliminary design.)

Thanks for your help,
Christian

Descriptions

Presentation 1

Title: Data Visualization at Urban Scale - NY Energy Consumption Map

Bianca Howard, Ph.D Candidate, Sustainable Engineering Studio, Columbia
University

Bianca?s talk will discuss the methods behind estimating annual building
energy consumption for New York City and the many iterations of visualizing
this information. She will also discuss the analysis for estimating the
potential for Combined Heat and Power at both the building and "microgrid"
scales which illustrates how the building energy consumption estimates were
utilized in her research.

About the Speaker: Bianca Howard is currently a Ph.D. Candidate in
mechanical engineering in the Sustainable Engineering Lab of Professor
Vijay Modi at Columbia University. She is also a trainee in the National
Science Foundation IGERT ?Solving Urbanization Challenges Through Design?.

Her research interests are in energy systems and evaluating various methods
of reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Recently her
work has been focused on the viability of combined heat and power in New
York City as well as estimating emissions reductions from changes in the
electricity load profile at the hourly time scale. The evaluation of
combined heat and power at both the building and microgrid scale has its
foundations in previous works of estimating building energy consumption for
the 5 boroughs.

Ms. Howard received her Bachelor?s of Science in Mechanical Engineering
from the University of Nebraska in 2009 and her Master?s of Science in
Mechanical Engineering from Columbia University in 2011.


Presentation 2

Title: CityEngine - GIS Based Data Visualization for Urban Scale
Developments

Patrick Gahagan, Solutions Engineer, ESRI, New York City

Esri's procedural or rule-based modeling software City Engine allows design
professionals to be creative and still meet sustainability goals.   City
Engine delivers a full suite of industry-leading procedural tools to
aggregate geospatial data, layout and edit street networks, generate and
modify buildings, and analyze urban planning projects.

Building Performance Simulation can be achieved in short order using City
Engine and templates that are created by the City Engine team. The Redlands
Redevelopment example is one of these templates and showcases an advanced
set of analytical tools created in response to the growing need for
measurable, performance-based design.

This presentation will provide an introduction to the City Engine
interface, and then focus on some of the eco-criteria and other performance
targets included with the Redlands Redevelopment example.  The reports
generated by City Engine on these performance targets provide instant
feedback to the designer, and enables the rapid launch of community design
and implementation strategies.

About the Speaker: Patrick Gahagan is a Solutions Engineer for Esri based
in New York City.  For many years he supported clients in NYC  government,
but has always kept a specialty in 3D GIS.  Patrick now supports clients in
the AEC and general 3D markets just about full time.   He was one of the
early internal adopters of City Engine, and has become an unofficial east
coast member of the 3D team at headquarters.

Those old rules of thumb can mean significantly higher capital cost. I
remember a project in the DC area about 20 years ago. Their rules of thumb
came up with 10,000 tons (yeah a big building) ... but when a colleague did
a back of the envelope calc (in the days before we even hope for low-energy
buildings), he came up with 3,000 tons... and that was very conservative.
So the owner was about to (and did) pay for 3x the size needed and I'm
willing to bet the building rarely goes over 2,000 tons.

Sometimes I think we get too caught up in the modeling.  Why not simply provide a manual block load analysis for the proposed building, with basic allowances for lighting, equipment, envelope loads, etc.  You could even provide both old school values like 2 W/SF for lighting vs. 1 W/SF today to show the building engineer why the values have dropped.  A one page summary of expected loads would provide all involved a snapshot of where the cooling loads are coming from, list assumptions, and possibly even identify areas for additional attention.  The building engineer could help define a "safety factor" to be included if desired.  Taking another step back in time, I believe the 1975 (first) ASHRAE energy code only required an average R3 window/wall insulation and R12 roof insulation.  We have come a long way!

Those old rules of thumb can mean significantly higher capital cost. I remember a project in the DC area about 20 years ago. Their rules of thumb came up with 10,000 tons (yeah a big building) ... but when a colleague did a back of the envelope calc (in the days before we even hope for low-energy buildings), he came up with 3,000 tons... and that was very conservative.  So the owner was about to (and did) pay for 3x the size needed and I'm willing to bet the building rarely goes over 2,000 tons.

Thanks.  I will consider the DOE reference buildings as an option, at least
for comparison.

Jim, to answer your questions without getting into project details...We have
been asked to give our opinion on the expected loads for a proposed building
so the owner can have an idea of what impact it will have on their central
plants.  We'll do this based primarily on similar past projects of ours.
However, the owner has an on-site engineer who is using very old ASHRAE
documentation to come up with his own (very high) design load estimates.
Apparently ASHRAE used to publish sf/ton guidance for office buildings?  I
would like to have some more current documentation to show the engineer to
help support my explanation of why our prediction will be lower than his.
Also, I think my wording concerning credibility came out wrong.  I certainly
wasn't implying that my company isn't highly capable/credible.  But it's
always nice to have a DOE report as backup documentation!

Thanks for your help,
Christian

Christian,
I suspect that you and your company are very credible and shouldn't hesitate
to claim the truth of that.  Your client probably would not have retained
you if that were not true!  It would be nice to have a 1000 building study
from DOE, though :) I wonder why your client is asking?  There are so many
design possibilities and at the end of the day, design load affects only
equipment size (including the electricity and fuel services).  These, in
turn, can be "managed" by choices for insulation, lighting, etc.
Another thing to consider (after assessing your firm's liability from
lawsuits) is that design loads occur infrequently in most climates, so much
so that a full energy model analysis can sometimes show that the impact on
comfort is minimal for a nominally UNDERsized HVAC system.
It's a tangled web!  I think I'd ask the basis of their concern about peak
load.

Jim,

Thanks.  Yes, I can do my own little study, and I can also just look back at
results from past projects.  That's a good suggestion.  But I was hoping to
have something credible to reference (outside my own firm) for the owner.  I
have seen DOE/National Lab comparisons of annual energy usage between the
different versions of 90.1...I was hoping there might be something similar
for design loads.

Dear Christian,
I do not know of any such resources!
What do you think about creating a "typical" building and trying out various
envelope, lighting, plug load and HVAC options in your climate to see the
impact of each? That should not be too daunting a task.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] New Rules of Thumb for Design Loads

Hello Group,

Does anyone know of any articles/papers/publications which address peak
design loads for buildings as energy codes evolve?  I am looking for basic
rules of thumb for sf/ton (cooling) and btuh/sf (heating).  People use these
rules of thumb all the time for initial assessments, sanity checks on
simulation results, etc, but I'm not sure that the rules of thumb are being
updated as energy codes become more aggressive.  For example, the engineers
I have been around since I entered the engineering world (granted, that was
only a few years ago) seem to always go back to 400 sf/ton as a standard
value, then adjust up or down depending on building characteristics.  I
haven't seen this  number change as buildings improve, or as I move to
different climate zones.  To be clear, I am interested in design loads, not
annual energy usage.

(Note:  Before anyone lambasts me for even bringing up rules of thumb for
design, I'll go ahead and say that I know they are gross estimations at
best, and should be used with extreme caution and judgment.  Nonetheless, I
see them used all the time, so I might as well get as good numbers as I can.
And a project I am on right now actually requires it (by owner) in
preliminary design.)

Thanks for your help,
Christian

I think there's been some conflating of annual energy simulations with loads calculations. 
To me, the big difference is not in their techniques, but their objectives, and it bothers 
me when I read posts suggesting that loads calculations can be done with rules of thumb, 
simple manual calculations, etc., which reminds me of what a DOE officer opined in a 
meeting one time that residential equipment were sized with the "door method", i.e., 
"whatever fits through the door".

In my opinion, both should be (and are being) done with equal rigor.  In fact, most of the 
dynamic calculation methods (cooling load temp. difference, response factors, radiant time 
series, etc.) were developed for load calculations, and only later extended to annual 
simulations.   From what I know, there are plenty of load calculation tools that rely on 
dynamic simulations, the main difference from annual simulations being what they assume 
for the building internal conditions and the outdoor conditions.  For an annual 
simulation, those are designed to be as representative or typical as possible of actual 
conditions.  For load calculations, these are the near worst case conditions (e.g., for 
heating - no internal loads, 99.6% climate conditions, no sun, etc.) to derive the peak 
loads, to which safety factors are often added.

When people persist in using per floor area loads, is that any different than estimating 
the annual consumption using fixed kBTU/ft2-yr numbers?  Does anyone think that either is 
credible?  As far as oversizing HVAC equipment, there are several factors at play - use of 
outdated "rules of thumb" derived  when buildings were leakier (but cooling intensities 
might actually be lower), overly conservative design conditions (as I once said to the 
owner of the Agenda 21 Building in Beijing - the peak load derived by his engineer assumes 
that you're hosting a conference in your building on the hottest day of the year), and the 
proverbial 30% safety factor.  Leaving aside the first factor, the latter two should 
explain all the differences between what a loads calculation program shows and the peak 
loads from an annual simulation.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that we should promote better load calculations rather 
than simply update "rules of thumb" or develop simple manual methods for the 
computer-challenged engineers.  Furthermore, as buildings improve, such simple methods are 
apt to be progressively less reliable.

In the case of large commercial buildings the cooling energy depends on
occupancy types & internal loads and winter energy depends on ventilation
rates (hospitals).  Weather has little effect because of the envelope
efficiency standards. 
It is possible to have cooling energy rules of (many) thumbs for different
types of commercial buildings.

Dear Christian,

What do you think about creating a "typical" building and trying out various

impact of each? That should not be too daunting a task.

Hello Group,

Does anyone know of any articles/papers/publications which address peak
design loads for buildings as energy codes evolve?  I am looking for basic
rules of thumb for sf/ton (cooling) and btuh/sf (heating).  People use these
rules of thumb all the time for initial assessments, sanity checks on
simulation results, etc, but I'm not sure that the rules of thumb are being
updated as energy codes become more aggressive.  For example, the engineers
I have been around since I entered the engineering world (granted, that was
only a few years ago) seem to always go back to 400 sf/ton as a standard
value, then adjust up or down depending on building characteristics.  I
haven't seen this  number change as buildings improve, or as I move to
different climate zones.  To be clear, I am interested in design loads, not
annual energy usage.

(Note:  Before anyone lambasts me for even bringing up rules of thumb for
design, I'll go ahead and say that I know they are gross estimations at
best, and should be used with extreme caution and judgment.  Nonetheless, I
see them used all the time, so I might as well get as good numbers as I can.
And a project I am on right now actually requires it (by owner) in
preliminary design.)

Thanks for your help,

Christian -



If the key issue is the vintage of the ASHRAE information used to estimate the loads per square foot - I am curious if ASHRAE has updated the loads per square foot check figures published in their ASHRAE Pocket Guide<http://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/products/1703568>. I have a 2001 and 2009 vintage: the 2009 version updates the Expected Lighting & Equipment Heat Gain (Office goes from 4 / 6/ 9 W/sf to 2 / 2.5 / 4 W/sf, low/med/hi) but keeps the expected Refrigeration density the same (360 / 280 / 190 sq ft / ton).



I wonder if the Refrigeration values in the current edition match the refrigeration values in the reference your client's in-house engineer is using.

David, Dru, Jim,



Thanks.  I will consider the DOE reference buildings as an option, at least for comparison.



Jim, to answer your questions without getting into project details...We have been asked to give our opinion on the expected loads for a proposed building so the owner can have an idea of what impact it will have on their central plants.  We'll do this based primarily on similar past projects of ours.

However, the owner has an on-site engineer who is using very old ASHRAE documentation to come up with his own (very high) design load estimates.

Apparently ASHRAE used to publish sf/ton guidance for office buildings?  I would like to have some more current documentation to show the engineer to help support my explanation of why our prediction will be lower than his.

Also, I think my wording concerning credibility came out wrong.  I certainly wasn't implying that my company isn't highly capable/credible.  But it's always nice to have a DOE report as backup documentation!



Thanks for your help,

Christian

Christian,

I suspect that you and your company are very credible and shouldn't hesitate to claim the truth of that.  Your client probably would not have retained you if that were not true!  It would be nice to have a 1000 building study from DOE, though :) I wonder why your client is asking?  There are so many design possibilities and at the end of the day, design load affects only equipment size (including the electricity and fuel services).  These, in turn, can be "managed" by choices for insulation, lighting, etc.

Another thing to consider (after assessing your firm's liability from

lawsuits) is that design loads occur infrequently in most climates, so much so that a full energy model analysis can sometimes show that the impact on comfort is minimal for a nominally UNDERsized HVAC system.

It's a tangled web!  I think I'd ask the basis of their concern about peak load.

Jim,



Thanks.  Yes, I can do my own little study, and I can also just look back at results from past projects.  That's a good suggestion.  But I was hoping to have something credible to reference (outside my own firm) for the owner.  I have seen DOE/National Lab comparisons of annual energy usage between the different versions of 90.1...I was hoping there might be something similar for design loads.



Thanks,

A block load calculation can be done VERY quickly.  Why bother with rules of thumb when a few minutes more gives you a fully customized load?

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] New Rules of Thumb for Design Loads

I think there's been some conflating of annual energy simulations with loads calculations. To me, the big difference is not in their techniques, but their objectives, and it bothers me when I read posts suggesting that loads calculations can be done with rules of thumb, simple manual calculations, etc., which reminds me of what a DOE officer opined in a meeting one time that residential equipment were sized with the "door method", i.e., "whatever fits through the door".

In my opinion, both should be (and are being) done with equal rigor.  In fact, most of the dynamic calculation methods (cooling load temp. difference, response factors, radiant time series, etc.) were developed for load calculations, and only later extended to annual simulations.   From what I know, there are plenty of load calculation tools that rely on dynamic simulations, the main difference from annual simulations being what they assume for the building internal conditions and the outdoor conditions.  For an annual simulation, those are designed to be as representative or typical as possible of actual conditions.  For load calculations, these are the near worst case conditions (e.g., for heating - no internal loads, 99.6% climate conditions, no sun, etc.) to derive the peak loads, to which safety factors are often added.

When people persist in using per floor area loads, is that any different than estimating the annual consumption using fixed kBTU/ft2-yr numbers?  Does anyone think that either is credible?  As far as oversizing HVAC equipment, there are several factors at play - use of outdated "rules of thumb" derived  when buildings were leakier (but cooling intensities might actually be lower), overly conservative design conditions (as I once said to the owner of the Agenda 21 Building in Beijing - the peak load derived by his engineer assumes that you're hosting a conference in your building on the hottest day of the year), and the proverbial 30% safety factor.  Leaving aside the first factor, the latter two should explain all the differences between what a loads calculation program shows and the peak loads from an annual simulation.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that we should promote better load calculations rather than simply update "rules of thumb" or develop simple manual methods for the computer-challenged engineers.  Furthermore, as buildings improve, such simple methods are apt to be progressively less reliable.

Sometimes I think we get too caught up in the modeling.  Why not simply provide a manual block load analysis for the proposed building, with basic allowances for lighting, equipment, envelope loads, etc.  You could even provide both old school values like 2 W/SF for lighting vs. 1 W/SF today to show the building engineer why the values have dropped.  A one page summary of expected loads would provide all involved a snapshot of where the cooling loads are coming from, list assumptions, and possibly even identify areas for additional attention.  The building engineer could help define a "safety factor" to be included if desired.  Taking another step back in time, I believe the 1975 (first) ASHRAE energy code only required an average R3 window/wall insulation and R12 roof insulation.  We have come a long way!

Those old rules of thumb can mean significantly higher capital cost. I remember a project in the DC area about 20 years ago. Their rules of thumb came up with 10,000 tons (yeah a big building) ... but when a colleague did a back of the envelope calc (in the days before we even hope for low-energy buildings), he came up with 3,000 tons... and that was very conservative.  So the owner was about to (and did) pay for 3x the size needed and I'm willing to bet the building rarely goes over 2,000 tons.

Christian,
I suspect that you and your company are very credible and shouldn't hesitate
to claim the truth of that.  Your client probably would not have retained
you if that were not true!  It would be nice to have a 1000 building study
from DOE, though :) I wonder why your client is asking?  There are so many
design possibilities and at the end of the day, design load affects only
equipment size (including the electricity and fuel services).  These, in
turn, can be "managed" by choices for insulation, lighting, etc.
Another thing to consider (after assessing your firm's liability from
lawsuits) is that design loads occur infrequently in most climates, so much
so that a full energy model analysis can sometimes show that the impact on
comfort is minimal for a nominally UNDERsized HVAC system.
It's a tangled web!  I think I'd ask the basis of their concern about peak
load.

Thanks.  Yes, I can do my own little study, and I can also just look back at

Hello Group,

Does anyone know of any articles/papers/publications which address peak
design loads for buildings as energy codes evolve?  I am looking for basic
rules of thumb for sf/ton (cooling) and btuh/sf (heating).  People use these
rules of thumb all the time for initial assessments, sanity checks on
simulation results, etc, but I'm not sure that the rules of thumb are being
updated as energy codes become more aggressive.  For example, the engineers
I have been around since I entered the engineering world (granted, that was
only a few years ago) seem to always go back to 400 sf/ton as a standard
value, then adjust up or down depending on building characteristics.  I
haven't seen this  number change as buildings improve, or as I move to
different climate zones.  To be clear, I am interested in design loads, not
annual energy usage.

(Note:  Before anyone lambasts me for even bringing up rules of thumb for
design, I'll go ahead and say that I know they are gross estimations at
best, and should be used with extreme caution and judgment.  Nonetheless, I
see them used all the time, so I might as well get as good numbers as I can.
And a project I am on right now actually requires it (by owner) in
preliminary design.)

Thanks for your help,
Christian

Re-posted (Not sure if the original got on the list?)

Dear all,

I'm hoping to find a method that can be implemented in Excel for extracting
a glazing transmittance from two or more sets of temperature results.

*Our problem:*
We assess simulated comfort criteria where operative temperatures in a zone
above 27degC must be in the 1%-ile or less. We extract a *glazing
transmission* that will 'only just' meet this criterion from two or more
sets of results. We have limited access to parametric runs, hence only two
or more sets of thermal modelling results.

*What we've used up to now:*
In order to 'roughly' evaluate the solar transmissivity that helps achieve
this criterion we have used TREND and other functions for curve fitting in
excel to interpolate a transmissivity from two or more sets of results.

We have two problems with this approach:
1. such a narrow band of results are being focused on so the calc is
subject to inaccuracies
2. our modelling software is limited to one hour timesteps and can only
report temperatures in 1 degree intervals

*Possible solution?*
My gut fee is that we can extract the information more reliably from a
broader band of data. Is there an approach that looks at the spread of
temperature distribution from, say, 25 to 28 degC for two or more result
sets and extracts the transmissivity that matches the 1%-ile.

*Is there such a method?*

Minor note: We limit changes to glazing absorptance between our parametric
runs, aiming for only changes in transmissivity and reflectance. We have
found operative temperatures to increase with higher glazing absorptance.

Best regards

Chris

I was afraid the conversation would go in this direction.hence the
disclaimer at the end of my original post.  But I think this is a good
string, I appreciate all of the comments and I agree with most of what is
being said.  On the value/appropriateness of rules of thumb for design:  I
fully agree that rules of thumb are not appropriate as a basis for actual
design.  I run computer simulated loads on a regular basis.  These often
take many hours of effort.  They are tailored specifically to what is
needed, whether it is plant size (chiller/boiler), AHU coil and fan sizes,
or VAV box/duct/diffuser sizes.  Each of these design needs require a
different modeling approach.  I can't imagine suggesting an equipment
purchase based on rules of thumb, and we never have.  It is even going
quickly out of style among HVAC contractors in the residential world. 

 

However, I do think that rules of thumb are very valuable and appropriate in
certain situations, and I would argue that almost every engineer uses them
whether or not they are conscious of it.  For instance, if I told you that I
designed an office building that consumes 2 kBTU/sf/yr and doesn't have any
renewable energy system, probably every person on this list would want a
little explanation.  That's because, based on years of accrued experience,
you know the reasonable range of annual energy consumption that can be
expected from an office building.  Further, your assessment that a 2
kBTU/sf/yr building needs some explaining took you about 1 second of
analysis.  That can be done on the fly, in a phone conversation with a less
technical or less experienced person who may not have any idea that this
value is unusual.  And the more experienced you gain, the more reliable your
mental assessments can be.  We have an engineer here that always seems to
know (within a few percent) what the results of my calculations will be long
before I get a final result.  And he will know immediately if there is
something fishy about my assumptions.  There are many times when it is
useful to know a reasonable range of values for design loads for a
particular building type without needing to do a block load or a full
simulation.

 

I was just hoping there might be a document which had compared design loads
between different versions of 90.1, similar to the energy comparisons that
have been done, so that I could have it in my back pocket.

 

Thanks for the lively responses!

 

Christian

A block load calculation can be done VERY quickly.  Why bother with rules of

I think there's been some conflating of annual energy simulations with loads
calculations. To me, the big difference is not in their techniques, but
their objectives, and it bothers me when I read posts suggesting that loads
calculations can be done with rules of thumb, simple manual calculations,
etc., which reminds me of what a DOE officer opined in a meeting one time
that residential equipment were sized with the "door method", i.e.,
"whatever fits through the door".  

In my opinion, both should be (and are being) done with equal rigor.  In
fact, most of the dynamic calculation methods (cooling load temp.
difference, response factors, radiant time series, etc.) were developed for
load calculations, and only later extended to annual simulations.   From
what I know, there are plenty of load calculation tools that rely on dynamic
simulations, the main difference from annual simulations being what they
assume for the building internal conditions and the outdoor conditions.  For
an annual simulation, those are designed to be as representative or typical
as possible of actual conditions.  For load calculations, these are the near
worst case conditions (e.g., for heating - no internal loads, 99.6% climate
conditions, no sun, etc.) to derive the peak loads, to which safety factors
are often added.

When people persist in using per floor area loads, is that any different
than estimating the annual consumption using fixed kBTU/ft2-yr numbers?
Does anyone think that either is credible?  As far as oversizing HVAC
equipment, there are several factors at play - use of outdated "rules of
thumb" derived  when buildings were leakier (but cooling intensities might
actually be lower), overly conservative design conditions (as I once said to
the owner of the Agenda 21 Building in Beijing - the peak load derived by
his engineer assumes that you're hosting a conference in your building on
the hottest day of the year), and the proverbial 30% safety factor.  Leaving
aside the first factor, the latter two should explain all the differences
between what a loads calculation program shows and the peak loads from an
annual simulation.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that we should promote better load
calculations rather than simply update "rules of thumb" or develop simple
manual methods for the computer-challenged engineers.  Furthermore, as
buildings improve, such simple methods are apt to be progressively less
reliable.

Sometimes I think we get too caught up in the modeling.  Why not simply
provide a manual block load analysis for the proposed building, with basic
allowances for lighting, equipment, envelope loads, etc.  You could even
provide both old school values like 2 W/SF for lighting vs. 1 W/SF today to
show the building engineer why the values have dropped.  A one page summary
of expected loads would provide all involved a snapshot of where the cooling
loads are coming from, list assumptions, and possibly even identify areas
for additional attention.  The building engineer could help define a "safety
factor" to be included if desired.  Taking another step back in time, I
believe the 1975 (first) ASHRAE energy code only required an average R3
window/wall insulation and R12 roof insulation.  We have come a long way!

Those old rules of thumb can mean significantly higher capital cost. I
remember a project in the DC area about 20 years ago. Their rules of thumb
came up with 10,000 tons (yeah a big building) ... but when a colleague did
a back of the envelope calc (in the days before we even hope for low-energy
buildings), he came up with 3,000 tons... and that was very conservative.
So the owner was about to (and did) pay for 3x the size needed and I'm
willing to bet the building rarely goes over 2,000 tons.

Jim, to answer your questions without getting into project details...We have
been asked to give our opinion on the expected loads for a proposed building
so the owner can have an idea of what impact it will have on their central
plants.  We'll do this based primarily on similar past projects of ours.
However, the owner has an on-site engineer who is using very old ASHRAE
documentation to come up with his own (very high) design load estimates.
Apparently ASHRAE used to publish sf/ton guidance for office buildings?  I
would like to have some more current documentation to show the engineer to

Hello Chris,



There is a method and it works like crazy if it is applied correctly to certain classes of buildings.



It?s called an "inverse method". However, applying it to houses in mass is not yet prime time. ASHRAE has some guidance on inverse methods for commercial buildings  in the soon-to-be-published Guideline-14 . When this comes out it will include a copy of the FORTRAN RP1050 toolkit and the spreadsheet RP1093 toolkit. With the RP1050 toolkit you can apply ASHRAE linear and change-point linear models to energy usage data and extract the gross parameters that the 3p change-point models yield. ASHRAE's RP1050 also provides a variable based degree day model, which is the same as PRISM, the Princeton Scorekeeping method. These gross parameters have been shown to be useful in determining weather-dependent and weather-independent parameters for a building. There are even papers where there has been speculation that the PRISM parameters could be "mined" to dig further into the "inverse description" of a building, such as Ari Rabl's 1980s paper published in Energy and Building?s special PRISM volume, and the more recent work by Kissock et al. at the University of Dayton on residential.



Ongoing work at our lab will soon show that these methods can be further extended for certain classes of buildings to approach an automated audit that ?guesses? the most probably U-value and SHGC for a window, R-value for roofs, etc. So far we've had some success using this ?blind calibration? method. We?re expecting a PhD thesis on this in the Spring 2014.

Re-posted (Not sure if the original got on the list?)

Dear all,

I'm hoping to find a method that can be implemented in Excel for extracting a glazing transmittance from two or more sets of temperature results.

Our problem:
We assess simulated comfort criteria where operative temperatures in a zone above 27degC must be in the 1%-ile or less. We extract a glazing transmission that will 'only just' meet this criterion from two or more sets of results. We have limited access to parametric runs, hence only two or more sets of thermal modelling results.

What we've used up to now:
In order to 'roughly' evaluate the solar transmissivity that helps achieve this criterion we have used TREND and other functions for curve fitting in excel to interpolate a transmissivity from two or more sets of results.

We have two problems with this approach:
1. such a narrow band of results are being focused on so the calc is subject to inaccuracies
2. our modelling software is limited to one hour timesteps and can only report temperatures in 1 degree intervals

Possible solution?
My gut fee is that we can extract the information more reliably from a broader band of data. Is there an approach that looks at the spread of temperature distribution from, say, 25 to 28 degC for two or more result sets and extracts the transmissivity that matches the 1%-ile.

Is there such a method?

Minor note: We limit changes to glazing absorptance between our parametric runs, aiming for only changes in transmissivity and reflectance. We have found operative temperatures to increase with higher glazing absorptance.

Jeff, 

 

Is the Fortran toolkit that you mention below an updated / improved version
of the toolkit released in ~ 2002, or is it the same program? And is there a
timeframe for when the new version of Guideline 14 will be published?   

 

Thank you,

 

Maria

Maria,



The toolkits are the same as the original RP1050 and RP1093.



The only difference is that Guideline 14 will now include more examples and datasets for use with the toolkit. An update to the toolkit has been discussed with ASHRAE Technical committee TC 4.7. However, and RTAR and/or WS has yet to materialize. The proposed update would include a recompiling of the FORTRAN code, possible pre and post data processors, and additional models, (i.e., an inverse BIN model, a 6 parameter model, weighted models, and perhaps how to do a CP/PCA model).



I'll have to check on the status of the Guideline. Last I heard it was sitting at ASHRAE publications for final edit.

This has been a fascinating question and thread, a few thoughts from my
limited experience as a mechanical engineer/energy modeler:



-          First off, I am a huge fan of rules of thumbs for initial design
and estimation, I would never sign off on a design that is built around
them. I will use rules of thumbs for early on, then fully anticipate
running a full load analysis/energy model later.



-          Yes the rules of thumb are based on building codes and
regulations from 30+ years ago, but at least a vast majority of our work is
renovation work, so in some cases those rules of thumb are not that
outdated. Granted we are typically updating the envelope, HVAC
efficiencies, internal loads such as lighting, but in those initial design
phases and meetings where everyone is looking at you for an answer, a rule
of thumb is often all you have, and experience and knowledge of the project
can hopefully help you hone those numbers in. But initially they are very
helpful.



-          I have also learned the owner loves when the price comes down,
not up. So if I overestimate the sizes of equipment with my rules of thumb
and later tell everyone it?s actually lower once I started my detailed
calculations, everyone understands and everyone is happy. Undersizing my
equipment and adding cost to the budget later on in the design process is
awful.



-          Finally, with all the modulating technologies we have today
oversizing equipment isn?t as terrible, at least with hydronic systems, DX
is a little tougher. Modulating chillers, boilers, pumps, fans and outside
air intake can all match the load surprisingly well, allowing for slight
oversizing, especially in the case below of the massive conference on the
hottest day of the year. Granted if my fan static pressure is 3? I?m going
to slap 6? on it, but we do have some saving grace from modulation.

I think there's been some conflating of annual energy simulations with
loads calculations. To me, the big difference is not in their techniques,
but their objectives, and it bothers me when I read posts suggesting that
loads calculations can be done with rules of thumb, simple manual
calculations, etc., which reminds me of what a DOE officer opined in a
meeting one time that residential equipment were sized with the "door
method", i.e., "whatever fits through the door".

In my opinion, both should be (and are being) done with equal rigor.  In
fact, most of the dynamic calculation methods (cooling load temp.
difference, response factors, radiant time series, etc.) were developed for
load calculations, and only later extended to annual simulations.   From
what I know, there are plenty of load calculation tools that rely on
dynamic simulations, the main difference from annual simulations being what
they assume for the building internal conditions and the outdoor
conditions.  For an annual simulation, those are designed to be as
representative or typical as possible of actual conditions.  For load
calculations, these are the near worst case conditions (e.g., for heating -
no internal loads, 99.6% climate conditions, no sun, etc.) to derive the
peak loads, to which safety factors are often added.

When people persist in using per floor area loads, is that any different
than estimating the annual consumption using fixed kBTU/ft2-yr numbers?
Does anyone think that either is credible?  As far as oversizing HVAC
equipment, there are several factors at play - use of outdated "rules of
thumb" derived  when buildings were leakier (but cooling intensities might
actually be lower), overly conservative design conditions (as I once said
to the owner of the Agenda 21 Building in Beijing - the peak load derived
by his engineer assumes that you're hosting a conference in your building
on the hottest day of the year), and the proverbial 30% safety factor.
Leaving aside the first factor, the latter two should explain all the
differences between what a loads calculation program shows and the peak
loads from an annual simulation.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that we should promote better load
calculations rather than simply update "rules of thumb" or develop simple
manual methods for the computer-challenged engineers.  Furthermore, as
buildings improve, such simple methods are apt to be progressively less
reliable.

Those old rules of thumb can mean significantly higher capital cost. I
remember a project in the DC area about 20 years ago. Their rules of thumb
came up with 10,000 tons (yeah a big building) ... but when a colleague did
a back of the envelope calc (in the days before we even hope for low-energy
buildings), he came up with 3,000 tons... and that was very conservative.
So the owner was about to (and did) pay for 3x the size needed and I'm
willing to bet the building rarely goes over 2,000 tons.

David, Dru, Jim,

for comparison.

Jim, to answer your questions without getting into project details...We have
been asked to give our opinion on the expected loads for a proposed building
so the owner can have an idea of what impact it will have on their central
plants.  We'll do this based primarily on similar past projects of ours.
However, the owner has an on-site engineer who is using very old ASHRAE
documentation to come up with his own (very high) design load estimates.
Apparently ASHRAE used to publish sf/ton guidance for office buildings?  I
would like to have some more current documentation to show the engineer to
help support my explanation of why our prediction will be lower than his.
Also, I think my wording concerning credibility came out wrong.  I certainly
wasn't implying that my company isn't highly capable/credible.  But it's
always nice to have a DOE report as backup documentation!

Christian,
I suspect that you and your company are very credible and shouldn't hesitate
to claim the truth of that.  Your client probably would not have retained
you if that were not true!  It would be nice to have a 1000 building study
from DOE, though :) I wonder why your client is asking?  There are so many
design possibilities and at the end of the day, design load affects only
equipment size (including the electricity and fuel services).  These, in
turn, can be "managed" by choices for insulation, lighting, etc.
Another thing to consider (after assessing your firm's liability from
lawsuits) is that design loads occur infrequently in most climates, so much
so that a full energy model analysis can sometimes show that the impact on
comfort is minimal for a nominally UNDERsized HVAC system.
It's a tangled web!  I think I'd ask the basis of their concern about peak
load.

Thanks.  Yes, I can do my own little study, and I can also just look back at
results from past projects.  That's a good suggestion.  But I was hoping to
have something credible to reference (outside my own firm) for the owner.  I
have seen DOE/National Lab comparisons of annual energy usage between the

What do you think about creating a "typical" building and trying out various
envelope, lighting, plug load and HVAC options in your climate to see the
impact of each? That should not be too daunting a task.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] New Rules of Thumb for Design Loads

Hello Group,

Does anyone know of any articles/papers/publications which address peak
design loads for buildings as energy codes evolve?  I am looking for basic
rules of thumb for sf/ton (cooling) and btuh/sf (heating).  People use these
rules of thumb all the time for initial assessments, sanity checks on
simulation results, etc, but I'm not sure that the rules of thumb are being
updated as energy codes become more aggressive.  For example, the engineers
I have been around since I entered the engineering world (granted, that was
only a few years ago) seem to always go back to 400 sf/ton as a standard
value, then adjust up or down depending on building characteristics.  I
haven't seen this  number change as buildings improve, or as I move to
different climate zones.  To be clear, I am interested in design loads, not
annual energy usage.

(Note:  Before anyone lambasts me for even bringing up rules of thumb for
design, I'll go ahead and say that I know they are gross estimations at
best, and should be used with extreme caution and judgment.  Nonetheless, I
see them used all the time, so I might as well get as good numbers as I can.
And a project I am on right now actually requires it (by owner) in
preliminary design.)

Thanks for your help,
Christian

I'm with Karen - I don't think you can simply explain this one away to a LEED reviewer and will need to address/correct the issues you've identified

If I'm not mistaken, "adiabatic" isn't an option for exterior surfaces however, at least through the eQuest detailed mode interface.  You could make a distinct roof construction which has an impossibly low U-value to severely limit heat transfer (to/from exterior conditions), but that won't correct the roof area figures your reviewer is tuned into.

In my opinion, the easiest reasonable thing to do would to assert (if you can) the thermostat setpoints are the identical between floors and therefore it's reasonable to not model heat transfer between floors, which means you can simply delete those "non-exposed" roofs.  Re-defining those surfaces to be adiabatic ceiling/floor (using an interior wall construction) would have the same net effect except to define additional thermal mass for the associated spaces.

The "partially correct" roof surface(s) on the other hand, which are both exposed and sandwiched, ought to be modified equally in both models to correct the exposed portion.  How simple/involved this is depends on your project's geometries.

Here's a procedure for a correcting a partially sandwiched, single surface roof.  This is done in detailed mode and assumes wizard-based model assembly:

-          Navigate to 3D view, highlight the roof surface to be edited

-          Open properties window for that surface via the component tree or right-click context menu.

-          Identify the referenced space polygon (green text) in the surface properties

-          Scroll down to that polygon in the component tree, right click, create a new polygon, copy the one you identified - name it anything you'll easily find in a long list.

-          Re-highlight that roof surface in the 3D view and open its properties window

-          Re-assign the polygon (green text) to the copied polygon with a unique name (will now be red text).  Click Done.  3D view should look like nothing has changed at this point.

o   Save a copy of your project separately before proceeding!

-          Keeping a clear view of the roof section to be edited, now scroll down and double click on the new copied polygon to pull up its vertices.

-          From here, play around with manually removing vertices to identify which consecutive series bounds the sandwiched portion of the surface. You will observe which vertices go away or move in the 3D view behind if you delete/edit these inputs.

-          Determine whether you need to define any new vertices, to define the "seam" edge where exposed roof meets exposed wall.  If so, experiment with editing a vertex to determine appropriate X/Y coordinates.

-          Once you've identified the vertices to remove and add, for eQuest stability reasons I try to edit existing polygon vertices before removing anything from the list (you'll typically end up with fewer vertices than you started).  This is hard to put to words but bear with me:  From the first vertex, identify the range which should remain (if any), then edit the following vertex points to any new coordinates you may have determined for additional points, then copy the series of vertices to remain from the end of the list up, then finally right-click and restore default to remove all vertices remaining in the list, starting from the bottom.

-          For context, I personally do not treat new/edited vertex coordinates super-precisely typically - anything that looks close to right in the 3D view is good enough for LEED.  Remember you'll be doing the same edits to both models.  Don't get worked up over small seams/holes in the picture - they don't cause roof leaks in in the model!

Procedure for a multi-surface roof (one per space/plenum) is the similar except you do it for each partially sandwiched roof section (don't worry this gets quicker/easier after the first couple).  Those fully-sandwiched sections can either be fully deleted per the above logic, or else re-defined as interior floor/ceiling surfaces if deemed necessary.

Until you wrap up such polygon geometry edits, save separately and often, and run a simulation to test everything is working okay.  I've had some mixed results doing such edits with eQuest interface open.  You may see errors/cautions pop up that can be simply clicked through without consequence.

When all is said and done, one piece of good news is you can save, close, and copy/paste all modified custom polygons between your baseline/proposed models, which makes doing the same edits on the other model as simple as re-assigning polygons (with 3D view up to check your work).

If the "roofs" don't have a zone as the outside boundary condition, then the model views them as roofs exposed to the exterior.  You need to fix this. If the spaces on the other side have the same thermostat setpoints, then the easiest thing to do is set the roof type to "adiabatic". This will save you from having to define new polygons if the floor above has different zone shapes.  For a roof that is only partially covered by the floor above, you need to create the new polygons. Sorry.

my understanding (in my case) is that if you create multiple shells and place them with a common wall that you want to be an interior the shell rotations need to be zero, even if you have the separation between the two shells occur at a 45 deg angle (then ask mr. architect about that one).

Hi Gang:

I need to elite for this one, and you know who you are..

I am reviewing another party's eQuest model submitted for LEED. The reviewer noted that the roof area far exceeded the actual building footprint.

Well, guess why? Somehow, the other party made several floors ROOFS instead of ceilings. I might be able to simply turn the exterior spaces into interior ceilings, but one roof (over an unheated underground garage) is partially uder the building and partially exposed to the "sidewalk/entrance" of the building.

The BIG Kahuena is this..if a space is crammed next to an adjacent space and one of the spaces claims an Exterioir surface between them, does DOE-2 think that Exterior surface is seeing outdoor conditions? Or does it ignore such a thin and merely considers the heat transfer between the spaces (like the wall/roof is NOT exposed to the outdoors)?

My approach is this (unless you disagree)..leave the Exterior wall/roof along and explain that the model (now in Detailed Edit form) would need major surgery to correct to show actual roof area. Having the "roofs" there versus floors will not change the thermodynamics of heat transfer.

I yield to the floor.

Maybe I'm missing something here, but why not just change those roofs that you want 
adiabatic to be Interior-walls and then change the INT-WALL-TYPE to be ADIABATIC ?   
Wouldn't that take care of both the heat flow problem as well as the area numbers ?

Hi Joe,

I briefly addressed that possibility in the highlighted line below.  I've done the same in the past, but I think often converting surface types can be more effort than necessary (I'd just delete them if it made sense for the circumstances).

That said, it's no effort to share a link for completeness =).  For a procedure detailing how to make an exterior surface an interior surface, here's an illustrated guide I posted a while ago:  http://onebuilding.org/wiki/doku.php/convert_an_exterior_surface_to_an_interior_surface_detailed

Most of my reply below is detailing how I deal with partially sandwiched surfaces through the eQuest interface, which requires polygon edits for correction.  I don't think I ever shared that previously on the lists...

Maybe I'm missing something here, but why not just change those roofs that you want adiabatic to be Interior-walls and then change the INT-WALL-TYPE to be ADIABATIC ?   Wouldn't that take care of both the heat flow problem as well as the area numbers ?

I'm with Karen - I don't think you can simply explain this one away to a LEED reviewer and will need to address/correct the issues you've identified

If I'm not mistaken, "adiabatic" isn't an option for exterior surfaces however, at least through the eQuest detailed mode interface.  You could make a distinct roof construction which has an impossibly low U-value to severely limit heat transfer (to/from exterior conditions), but that won't correct the roof area figures your reviewer is tuned into.

In my opinion, the easiest reasonable thing to do would to assert (if you can) the thermostat setpoints are the identical between floors and therefore it's reasonable to not model heat transfer between floors, which means you can simply delete those "non-exposed" roofs.  Re-defining those surfaces to be adiabatic ceiling/floor (using an interior wall construction) would have the same net effect except to define additional thermal mass for the associated spaces.

The "partially correct" roof surface(s) on the other hand, which are both exposed and sandwiched, ought to be modified equally in both models to correct the exposed portion.  How simple/involved this is depends on your project's geometries.

Here's a procedure for a correcting a partially sandwiched, single surface roof.  This is done in detailed mode and assumes wizard-based model assembly:

Navigate to 3D view, highlight the roof surface to be edited

Open properties window for that surface via the component tree or right-click context menu.

Identify the referenced space polygon (green text) in the surface properties

Scroll down to that polygon in the component tree, right click, create a new polygon, copy the one you identified - name it anything you'll easily find in a long list.

Re-highlight that roof surface in the 3D view and open its properties window

Re-assign the polygon (green text) to the copied polygon with a unique name (will now be red text).  Click Done.  3D view should look like nothing has changed at this point.

Save a copy of your project separately before proceeding!

Keeping a clear view of the roof section to be edited, now scroll down and double click on the new copied polygon to pull up its vertices.

>From here, play around with manually removing vertices to identify which consecutive series bounds the sandwiched portion of the surface. You will observe which vertices go away or move in the 3D view behind if you delete/edit these inputs.

Determine whether you need to define any new vertices, to define the "seam" edge where exposed roof meets exposed wall.  If so, experiment with editing a vertex to determine appropriate X/Y coordinates.

Once you've identified the vertices to remove and add, for eQuest stability reasons I try to edit existing polygon vertices before removing anything from the list (you'll typically end up with fewer vertices than you started).  This is hard to put to words but bear with me:  From the first vertex, identify the range which should remain (if any), then edit the following vertex points to any new coordinates you may have determined for additional points, then copy the series of vertices to remain from the end of the list up, then finally right-click and restore default to remove all vertices remaining in the list, starting from the bottom.

For context, I personally do not treat new/edited vertex coordinates super-precisely typically - anything that looks close to right in the 3D view is good enough for LEED.  Remember you'll be doing the same edits to both models.  Don't get worked up over small seams/holes in the picture - they don't cause roof leaks in in the model!

Procedure for a multi-surface roof (one per space/plenum) is the similar except you do it for each partially sandwiched roof section (don't worry this gets quicker/easier after the first couple).  Those fully-sandwiched sections can either be fully deleted per the above logic, or else re-defined as interior floor/ceiling surfaces if deemed necessary.

When all is said and done, one piece of good news is you can save, close, and copy/paste all modified custom polygons between your baseline/proposed models, which makes doing the same edits on the other model as simple as re-assigning polygons (with 3D view up to check your work).

If the "roofs" don't have a zone as the outside boundary condition, then the model views them as roofs exposed to the exterior.  You need to fix this. If the spaces on the other side have the same thermostat setpoints, then the easiest thing to do is set the roof type to "adiabatic". This will save you from having to define new polygons if the floor above has different zone shapes.  For a roof that is only partially covered by the floor above, you need to create the new polygons. Sorry.

Well, guess why? Somehow, the other party made several floors ROOFS instead of ceilings. I might be able to simply turn the exterior spaces into interior ceilings, but one roof (over an unheated underground garage) is partially uder the building and partially exposed to the "sidewalk/entrance" of the building.

The BIG Kahuena is this..if a space is crammed next to an adjacent space and one of the spaces claims an Exterioir surface between them, does DOE-2 think that Exterior surface is seeing outdoor conditions? Or does it ignore such a thin and merely considers the heat transfer between the spaces (like the wall/roof is NOT exposed to the outdoors)?

My approach is this (unless you disagree)..leave the Exterior wall/roof along and explain that the model (now in Detailed Edit form) would need major surgery to correct to show actual roof area. Having the "roofs" there versus floors will not change the thermodynamics of heat transfer.

I yield to the floor.

I would recommend deleting the roofs where roofs are actually not and create a floor and a ceiling.  In order for two spaces to most accurately model heat transfer between them, each space needs to have a construction at the joining surface.

For example, a single space per floor that is two storey's will need a ceiling construction on the first floor and a floor construction on the second floor.

Also, as mentioned...a construction will need to be created for all spaces that have adjoining surfaces.
Take the example above and make the second storey two spaces, the single space on the first floor will need two separate ceiling constructions as the second floor spaces will have two floor constructions.

This is the kind of stuff they don't talk about at home 'building energy modeling' school.  I suppose either way might not matter much for green building rating systems but I have seen it make a difference in unmet hours, usage, etc.

Thanks,
Kevin

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Really need some deep DOE-2 theology on this one..

I'm with Karen - I don't think you can simply explain this one away to a LEED reviewer and will need to address/correct the issues you've identified

If I'm not mistaken, "adiabatic" isn't an option for exterior surfaces however, at least through the eQuest detailed mode interface.  You could make a distinct roof construction which has an impossibly low U-value to severely limit heat transfer (to/from exterior conditions), but that won't correct the roof area figures your reviewer is tuned into.

In my opinion, the easiest reasonable thing to do would to assert (if you can) the thermostat setpoints are the identical between floors and therefore it's reasonable to not model heat transfer between floors, which means you can simply delete those "non-exposed" roofs.  Re-defining those surfaces to be adiabatic ceiling/floor (using an interior wall construction) would have the same net effect except to define additional thermal mass for the associated spaces.

The "partially correct" roof surface(s) on the other hand, which are both exposed and sandwiched, ought to be modified equally in both models to correct the exposed portion.  How simple/involved this is depends on your project's geometries.

Here's a procedure for a correcting a partially sandwiched, single surface roof.  This is done in detailed mode and assumes wizard-based model assembly:

-          Navigate to 3D view, highlight the roof surface to be edited

-          Open properties window for that surface via the component tree or right-click context menu.

-          Identify the referenced space polygon (green text) in the surface properties

-          Scroll down to that polygon in the component tree, right click, create a new polygon, copy the one you identified - name it anything you'll easily find in a long list.

-          Re-highlight that roof surface in the 3D view and open its properties window

-          Re-assign the polygon (green text) to the copied polygon with a unique name (will now be red text).  Click Done.  3D view should look like nothing has changed at this point.

o   Save a copy of your project separately before proceeding!

-          Keeping a clear view of the roof section to be edited, now scroll down and double click on the new copied polygon to pull up its vertices.

-          From here, play around with manually removing vertices to identify which consecutive series bounds the sandwiched portion of the surface. You will observe which vertices go away or move in the 3D view behind if you delete/edit these inputs.

-          Determine whether you need to define any new vertices, to define the "seam" edge where exposed roof meets exposed wall.  If so, experiment with editing a vertex to determine appropriate X/Y coordinates.

-          Once you've identified the vertices to remove and add, for eQuest stability reasons I try to edit existing polygon vertices before removing anything from the list (you'll typically end up with fewer vertices than you started).  This is hard to put to words but bear with me:  From the first vertex, identify the range which should remain (if any), then edit the following vertex points to any new coordinates you may have determined for additional points, then copy the series of vertices to remain from the end of the list up, then finally right-click and restore default to remove all vertices remaining in the list, starting from the bottom.

-          For context, I personally do not treat new/edited vertex coordinates super-precisely typically - anything that looks close to right in the 3D view is good enough for LEED.  Remember you'll be doing the same edits to both models.  Don't get worked up over small seams/holes in the picture - they don't cause roof leaks in in the model!

Procedure for a multi-surface roof (one per space/plenum) is the similar except you do it for each partially sandwiched roof section (don't worry this gets quicker/easier after the first couple).  Those fully-sandwiched sections can either be fully deleted per the above logic, or else re-defined as interior floor/ceiling surfaces if deemed necessary.

Until you wrap up such polygon geometry edits, save separately and often, and run a simulation to test everything is working okay.  I've had some mixed results doing such edits with eQuest interface open.  You may see errors/cautions pop up that can be simply clicked through without consequence.

When all is said and done, one piece of good news is you can save, close, and copy/paste all modified custom polygons between your baseline/proposed models, which makes doing the same edits on the other model as simple as re-assigning polygons (with 3D view up to check your work).

If the "roofs" don't have a zone as the outside boundary condition, then the model views them as roofs exposed to the exterior.  You need to fix this. If the spaces on the other side have the same thermostat setpoints, then the easiest thing to do is set the roof type to "adiabatic". This will save you from having to define new polygons if the floor above has different zone shapes.  For a roof that is only partially covered by the floor above, you need to create the new polygons. Sorry.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] CAV to VAV issues in EnergyPlus
Message-ID: <CAAWVJ6gQowMRYNSEYonhuaNi-5Z_LVLCnjvms+p89bdoZZz9fg@mail.gmail.com>

I will start out by saying I am not an EnergyPlus expert. I am trying to
convert one of the DOE commercial building E+ prototypes from a CAV system
to a VAV system to determine the energy savings. I have modified the
baseline CAV model for one of the zones thus far to a VAV system, but the
VAV model is using more energy than the CAV model. I also have a lot more
unmet hours for both heating and cooling. I cannot figure out what is
causing these issues (I assume they are related). My current guess is that
I continue to use the same cooling coil (Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed) in
the VAV model, rather than converting the coil to Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed
as I see in most of the other DOE prototype VAV models.

My questions are:
1. Is it ok to use the Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed in a VAV system, or
should I convert that to a Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed?
2. If it I convert the VAV model to the Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed is this
analogous to modifying the baseline compressor to a variable speed
compressor?

Thanks for any help.
Ryan

To be clear, for an eQuest/DOE2 model I'm pretty sure only a single surface need be defined to transfer heat between two zones.  It can be defined under either space and thermally linked to the other space via the "NEXT-TO" parameter.

I believe defining a surface in both spaces, each linking the other space, for the same real-world construction plane would in effect double the surface area for transfer between the spaces.

In the common scenario of a plenum in between floors (meaning three zones), a minimum of two surfaces (representative of the "ceiling" and "floor/deck" constructions) are required to model heat transfer between all three zones.

I agree there are cases where inter-floor heat transfer cannot be dismissed as negligible, I simply mean to highlight there are scenarios where this case can be made, which can simplify how to address the posed issue of incorrect roof surface areas.  As with any consideration of simplification in an energy model, if one is ever unsure it's usually better to err on the side of "more accurate," time allowing.  This allows you to explore either option and gain first-hand experience that will help you make such judgements in the future.

You could say I'm one of those self-taught/home-schooled energy modelers however (many of us on these lists are), so please do not hesitate to correct or inform me if I'm missing anything commonly taught in the formal programs!  One of the most valuable lessons I've learned to apply to the field of energy modeling, paraphrasing Donald Rumsfeld<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns>: There are always things you know, things you don't know, and things you don't know you don't know.

Remember you'll be doing the same edits to both models.  Don't get worked up over small seams/holes in the picture - they don't cause roof leaks in in the model!

Procedure for a multi-surface roof (one per space/plenum) is the similar except you do it for each partially sandwiched roof section (don't worry this gets quicker/easier after the first couple).  Those fully-sandwiched sections can either be fully deleted per the above logic, or else re-defined as interior floor/ceiling surfaces if deemed necessary.

Until you wrap up such polygon geometry edits, save separately and often, and run a simulation to test everything is working okay.  I've had some mixed results doing such edits with eQuest interface open.  You may see errors/cautions pop up that can be simply clicked through without consequence.

When all is said and done, one piece of good news is you can save, close, and copy/paste all modified custom polygons between your baseline/proposed models, which makes doing the same edits on the other model as simple as re-assigning polygons (with 3D view up to check your work).

If the "roofs" don't have a zone as the outside boundary condition, then the model views them as roofs exposed to the exterior.  You need to fix this. If the spaces on the other side have the same thermostat setpoints, then the easiest thing to do is set the roof type to "adiabatic". This will save you from having to define new polygons if the floor above has different zone shapes.  For a roof that is only partially covered by the floor above, you need to create the new polygons. Sorry.

I am reviewing another party's eQuest model submitted for LEED. The reviewer noted that the roof area far exceeded the actual building footprint.

Well, guess why? Somehow, the other party made several floors ROOFS instead of ceilings. I might be able to simply turn the exterior spaces into interior ceilings, but one roof (over an unheated underground garage) is partially uder the building and partially exposed to the "sidewalk/entrance" of the building.

The BIG Kahuena is this..if a space is crammed next to an adjacent space and one of the spaces claims an Exterioir surface between them, does DOE-2 think that Exterior surface is seeing outdoor conditions? Or does it ignore such a thin and merely considers the heat transfer between the spaces (like the wall/roof is NOT exposed to the outdoors)?

My approach is this (unless you disagree)..leave the Exterior wall/roof along and explain that the model (now in Detailed Edit form) would need major surgery to correct to show actual roof area. Having the "roofs" there versus floors will not change the thermodynamics of heat transfer.

I yield to the floor.

Ryan,

In terms of debugging your model, it would be constructive to know where the energy use differs: increased heating, cooling, or fan energy? Also, you may want to take a look at the table file and double-check that the coil and fan sizes, and design OA flow rates are identical between the two models. It's possible that in your conversion you modified something that is causing your system to size differently (presuming you're not hard-sizing everything). That's where I'd start.

Thanks,
Danny

Subject: [Bldg-sim] CAV to VAV issues in EnergyPlus

I will start out by saying I am not an EnergyPlus expert. I am trying to convert one of the DOE commercial building E+ prototypes from a CAV system to a VAV system to determine the energy savings. I have modified the baseline CAV model for one of the zones thus far to a VAV system, but the VAV model is using more energy than the CAV model. I also have a lot more unmet hours for both heating and cooling. I cannot figure out what is causing these issues (I assume they are related). My current guess is that I continue to use the same cooling coil (Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed) in the VAV model, rather than converting the coil to Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed as I see in most of the other DOE prototype VAV models.
My questions are:
1. Is it ok to use the Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed in a VAV system, or should I convert that to a Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed?
2. If it I convert the VAV model to the Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoSpeed is this analogous to modifying the baseline compressor to a variable speed compressor?
Thanks for any help.
Ryan

Ok, that is right.  The INTERIOR-WALL dictionary discussion appears to address this.  Maybe its Eplus that needs walls for each space that is adjacent.
Thanks for pointing out the correction.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Really need some deep DOE-2 theology on this one..

To be clear, for an eQuest/DOE2 model I'm pretty sure only a single surface need be defined to transfer heat between two zones.  It can be defined under either space and thermally linked to the other space via the "NEXT-TO" parameter.

I believe defining a surface in both spaces, each linking the other space, for the same real-world construction plane would in effect double the surface area for transfer between the spaces.

In the common scenario of a plenum in between floors (meaning three zones), a minimum of two surfaces (representative of the "ceiling" and "floor/deck" constructions) are required to model heat transfer between all three zones.

I agree there are cases where inter-floor heat transfer cannot be dismissed as negligible, I simply mean to highlight there are scenarios where this case can be made, which can simplify how to address the posed issue of incorrect roof surface areas.  As with any consideration of simplification in an energy model, if one is ever unsure it's usually better to err on the side of "more accurate," time allowing.  This allows you to explore either option and gain first-hand experience that will help you make such judgements in the future.

You could say I'm one of those self-taught/home-schooled energy modelers however (many of us on these lists are), so please do not hesitate to correct or inform me if I'm missing anything commonly taught in the formal programs!  One of the most valuable lessons I've learned to apply to the field of energy modeling, paraphrasing Donald Rumsfeld<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns>: There are always things you know, things you don't know, and things you don't know you don't know.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Really need some deep DOE-2 theology on this one..

I would recommend deleting the roofs where roofs are actually not and create a floor and a ceiling.  In order for two spaces to most accurately model heat transfer between them, each space needs to have a construction at the joining surface.

For example, a single space per floor that is two storey's will need a ceiling construction on the first floor and a floor construction on the second floor.

Also, as mentioned...a construction will need to be created for all spaces that have adjoining surfaces.
Take the example above and make the second storey two spaces, the single space on the first floor will need two separate ceiling constructions as the second floor spaces will have two floor constructions.

This is the kind of stuff they don't talk about at home 'building energy modeling' school.  I suppose either way might not matter much for green building rating systems but I have seen it make a difference in unmet hours, usage, etc.

Thanks,
Kevin

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Really need some deep DOE-2 theology on this one..

I'm with Karen - I don't think you can simply explain this one away to a LEED reviewer and will need to address/correct the issues you've identified

If I'm not mistaken, "adiabatic" isn't an option for exterior surfaces however, at least through the eQuest detailed mode interface.  You could make a distinct roof construction which has an impossibly low U-value to severely limit heat transfer (to/from exterior conditions), but that won't correct the roof area figures your reviewer is tuned into.

In my opinion, the easiest reasonable thing to do would to assert (if you can) the thermostat setpoints are the identical between floors and therefore it's reasonable to not model heat transfer between floors, which means you can simply delete those "non-exposed" roofs.  Re-defining those surfaces to be adiabatic ceiling/floor (using an interior wall construction) would have the same net effect except to define additional thermal mass for the associated spaces.

The "partially correct" roof surface(s) on the other hand, which are both exposed and sandwiched, ought to be modified equally in both models to correct the exposed portion.  How simple/involved this is depends on your project's geometries.

Here's a procedure for a correcting a partially sandwiched, single surface roof.  This is done in detailed mode and assumes wizard-based model assembly:

-          Navigate to 3D view, highlight the roof surface to be edited

-          Open properties window for that surface via the component tree or right-click context menu.

-          Identify the referenced space polygon (green text) in the surface properties

-          Scroll down to that polygon in the component tree, right click, create a new polygon, copy the one you identified - name it anything you'll easily find in a long list.

-          Re-highlight that roof surface in the 3D view and open its properties window

-          Re-assign the polygon (green text) to the copied polygon with a unique name (will now be red text).  Click Done.  3D view should look like nothing has changed at this point.

o   Save a copy of your project separately before proceeding!

-          Keeping a clear view of the roof section to be edited, now scroll down and double click on the new copied polygon to pull up its vertices.

-          From here, play around with manually removing vertices to identify which consecutive series bounds the sandwiched portion of the surface. You will observe which vertices go away or move in the 3D view behind if you delete/edit these inputs.

-          Determine whether you need to define any new vertices, to define the "seam" edge where exposed roof meets exposed wall.  If so, experiment with editing a vertex to determine appropriate X/Y coordinates.

-          Once you've identified the vertices to remove and add, for eQuest stability reasons I try to edit existing polygon vertices before removing anything from the list (you'll typically end up with fewer vertices than you started).  This is hard to put to words but bear with me:  From the first vertex, identify the range which should remain (if any), then edit the following vertex points to any new coordinates you may have determined for additional points, then copy the series of vertices to remain from the end of the list up, then finally right-click and restore default to remove all vertices remaining in the list, starting from the bottom.

-          For context, I personally do not treat new/edited vertex coordinates super-precisely typically - anything that looks close to right in the 3D view is good enough for LEED.  Remember you'll be doing the same edits to both models.  Don't get worked up over small seams/holes in the picture - they don't cause roof leaks in in the model!

Procedure for a multi-surface roof (one per space/plenum) is the similar except you do it for each partially sandwiched roof section (don't worry this gets quicker/easier after the first couple).  Those fully-sandwiched sections can either be fully deleted per the above logic, or else re-defined as interior floor/ceiling surfaces if deemed necessary.

Until you wrap up such polygon geometry edits, save separately and often, and run a simulation to test everything is working okay.  I've had some mixed results doing such edits with eQuest interface open.  You may see errors/cautions pop up that can be simply clicked through without consequence.

When all is said and done, one piece of good news is you can save, close, and copy/paste all modified custom polygons between your baseline/proposed models, which makes doing the same edits on the other model as simple as re-assigning polygons (with 3D view up to check your work).

Thanks for the quick reply Daniel.

I have checked the Report: Equipment Summary tables. Here all is identical
between the two models, except for the Heating Coil for the zone I
modified. For the VAV system, the Heating Coil nominal capacity is 28,369 W
vs 68,845 W for the CAV system. All the other heating, cooling and fan
systems are sized the same between the models.

In the Report: HVAC Sizing Summary everything is identical.

For the zone I switched the Time Setpoint Not Met has increased
significantly for both cooling and heating, and during occupied and
unoccupied periods.

In the Outdoor Air summary: both mechanical ventilation and infiltration
are minimally different in all zones (differences are in the hundredths).

As for where the energy differences are:
Fan Energy: slight decrease in overall fan energy (I have only changed a
small zone)
Heating: increase in heating energy
Cooling: increase in cooling energy

I think this sums it up. From this, maybe the issue is with the heating
rather than the cooling coils. There is a significant difference in the
heating coil nominal capacity.

***********************************************************



Our technical presentation will be given by Oliver Davis and Matt Brown from concept 3D, the developers of the upcoming Simuwatt Audit tool.

This software is being developed in partnership with NREL and will incorporate geometric capture, the Building Component Library, OpenStudio and EnergyPlus. The purpose is to standardize the commercial building energy audit process, to make it more collaborative and consistent, and to reduce the cost for investment-grade energy audits.

Hi Ryan,

Check VAV minimum airflow set point within the zone which might be a big
reason to increase the reheat load and the cooling load accordingly.

You are asking for weather data for a fairly war-torn location, so the chances of 
continuous weather data is not good.

According to the ISH data base, there is a WMO weather station at FOB BAMYAN WMO#671774, 
located at 34.817 N, 67.833 E, but there's only 3 months of data for 2013.  Prior to 2013, 
the same WMO #671774 was listed as COP CHEROKEE (probably a US army base) located at 
33.65N, 68.900 E, with three years of data (2010, 2011, and 2012).

These historical weather files (AFG_FOB-BAMYAN_691774_13,  AFG_COP-CHEROKEE_691774_12, 
AFG_COP-CHEROKEE_691774_11, AFG_COP-CHEROKEE_691774_10) can all be found on my weather 
data web site
( http://weather.whiteboxtechnologies.com ), although I would not recommend getting the 
Bamyan 2013 file due to data incompleteness.  These historical weather files cost $50 
each, and can be downloaded immediately.

In addition, I can also create a rough "typical year" weather file from the 3 available 
years for COP-CHEROKEE_691774,
but that would be a custom request.  For such custom typical year weather files, I charge 
$75, with a turnaround of an hour during working hours.

Does anyone on this list know of a version of Equest that has been modified
to handle CHP projects in a simple manner?  This would be a great help in
our CHP design course at UIC.

 

Thank You

Jim Dirkes - How refreshing to hear from an articulate, knowledgeable, and
hopeful voice in the building simulation community.  My wife and I only have
one child, but we believe wholeheartedly the future rests on the talents and
energy of each new life, as they get their opportunity to make a difference.

 

Varkie Thomas - If you prefer to downsize the population in order to
maintain your standard of living, I would only ask how who decides who gets
to go on and who does not?  If the vast majority of Americans and the others
comprising the 30% that are using all of our resources, aren't we being a
bit selfish?  Why shouldn't we get along with a few less "things" so others
can at least eat and drink? Then in only a generation or two, or even in
four, if we continue to follow the truths that have gotten us this far, we
will have additional new opportunities to act on; well before the forest,
vegetation, and large animals will be devastated in a few hundred years. 

 

After all we have made quite a bit of progress in the last four generations,
although we must be ever vigilant to keep freedom, life, and liberty for
each individual at the forefront of discussion.

This discussion may not belong in Bldg-Sim.  I received several responses
directly.  All of them the disagreed with my suggestion of human population
control to save energy, the environment and the planet.  The arguments were

Maybe the people that would know anything can't even check their email, or are home working on that novel they've always wanted to write...

Message-ID: <29CF09A25AE46E4AA61E6E9073BC97173607861E@AEI-EX1.aeieng.lan>

Hi there,

I came across a strange thing on a LEEDv3 (v2009) project. One team was working on SSc8 and the other on EAc1. While the exterior lighting power density should be calculated in accordance with A90.1-2007, section 9, Table 1 in both cases, the SSc8 template (referring in the description field to A90.1-2007) was automatically looking up A90.1-2010 values (allowable LPD) while EAc1, table 1.4 was using A90.1-2007 values. I know that usually the LEED reviewer flags (cross-checks SSc8 vs EAc1 ext. lighting calcs) this if inconsistency is found. Has anyone experienced a mistake like this???...and how did you resolve it???

Thanks,
Norbert

Norbert,

Our electrical engineer ran into this exact thing Wednesday.

Not sure how he resolved it, but you aren't crazy, we found the same thing.

- I'll see what I can find out Tuesday, after Labor Day, if I'm not furloughed.

I ran into this face first a few months back - see attached attempt at a heads up for more information.

In short, the SSc8 templates are based around 90.1-2007 addendum i, note LEED is a bit misleading and incorrectly calls it addendum 1.

If your project was registered prior to November of 2011 you might be able to make a case to use the pre-addenda calculations.

I anticipate otherwise your SSc8 team needs to re-do their calculations, and you'll need to update your model's proposed/baseline figures in kind.

Sorry for the probably-bad news =(,

~Nick

Good morning, all,

Although Addendum I must be used for projects registered after the cited
date, the Baseline exterior lighting power allowance may still be calculated
bases on 90.1-2007 without addendum i. If using the revised baseline for
SSc8, only the reported proposed exterior lighting power must be reported
identically. The new Supplemental Section 1.4 Tables spreadsheet
automatically calculates the baseline exterior lighting allowance using this
methodology.

Have a great day!

All,

Thank you to those that sent replies offline, and to those that didn't because they are frantically doing damage control before getting furloughed. I'll paraphrase the anecdotes (which I have not tried to personally verify):

EPA - closed

-          Portfolio Manager and Target Manager are down.
GSA - closed
NASA - closed
Commerce (NIST) - closed
IRS - closed (at least partially)

DOE/EERE - mixed state of shutdown

-          DOE/EERE funding is not all tied to fiscal year budgets

-          DOE shutdown is still possible, perhaps even this week

National labs - mixed state of shutdown

-          Labs/projects that are industry-funded may be able to stay open longer (but only a few weeks)

-          Labs that are DOE funded will shut down soon, perhaps this week

-          Travel and non-essential spending is curtailed at all labs

-          If DOE shuts down completely, all labs may have to shut down regardless of funding situation

Employees that are furloughed

-          Cannot check email

-          Cannot check voice mail

-          Cannot do any project/lab related work

-          Will not get paid unless Congress authorizes back pay

Again, this information is based on a handful of replies. I have no further information but you can reply to the list and maybe get a your own personal correspondence going.

Regards,
Bill

Hi Cam, thanks for the input!

I've re-read your response a few times and would like to be sure I fully understand.  Would you please confirm (or otherwise correct) the following statements?  

1. Where SSc8 documentation must follow addendum i to calculate the exterior lighting power allowance, the baseline energy model for EAp2/EAc1 may optionally document a differing exterior lighting power allowance per 90.1-2007 without addendum i.  

2. Proposed exterior lighting power should match between SSc8 documentation and the EAp2/EAc1 Proposed energy model, for any case.

Thank you,

~Nick

Good morning, all,

Although Addendum I must be used for projects registered after the cited date, the Baseline exterior lighting power allowance may still be calculated bases on 90.1-2007 without addendum i. If using the revised baseline for SSc8, only the reported proposed exterior lighting power must be reported identically. The new Supplemental Section 1.4 Tables spreadsheet automatically calculates the baseline exterior lighting allowance using this methodology.

Have a great day!

I ran into this face first a few months back - see attached attempt at a heads up for more information.

In short, the SSc8 templates are based around 90.1-2007 addendum i, note LEED is a bit misleading and incorrectly calls it addendum 1.

If your project was registered prior to November of 2011 you might be able to make a case to use the pre-addenda calculations.

I anticipate otherwise your SSc8 team needs to re-do their calculations, and you'll need to update your model's proposed/baseline figures in kind.

Sorry for the probably-bad news =(,

~Nick

Hi there,

 

I came across a strange thing on a LEEDv3 (v2009) project. One team was working on SSc8 and the other on EAc1. While the exterior lighting power density should be calculated in accordance with A90.1-2007, section 9, Table
1 in both cases, the SSc8 template (referring in the description field to
A90.1-2007) was automatically looking up A90.1-2010 values (allowable LPD) while EAc1, table 1.4 was using A90.1-2007 values. I know that usually the LEED reviewer flags (cross-checks SSc8 vs EAc1 ext. lighting calcs) this if inconsistency is found. Has anyone experienced a mistake like this???...and how did you resolve it???

 

Thanks,

Norbert

Bill,

Thank you for having the foresight and for taking the initiative to get a handle on the state of affairs for our community.  This is very useful for those of us anticipating/depending upon interactions with these groups.  Some of us have not received an official heads up in any other form!

All,

Thank you to those that sent replies offline, and to those that didn't because they are frantically doing damage control before getting furloughed. I'll paraphrase the anecdotes (which I have not tried to personally verify):

EPA - closed

-          Portfolio Manager and Target Manager are down.
GSA - closed
NASA - closed
Commerce (NIST) - closed
IRS - closed (at least partially)

DOE/EERE - mixed state of shutdown

-          DOE/EERE funding is not all tied to fiscal year budgets

-          DOE shutdown is still possible, perhaps even this week

National labs - mixed state of shutdown

-          Labs/projects that are industry-funded may be able to stay open longer (but only a few weeks)

-          Labs that are DOE funded will shut down soon, perhaps this week

-          Travel and non-essential spending is curtailed at all labs

-          If DOE shuts down completely, all labs may have to shut down regardless of funding situation

Employees that are furloughed

-          Cannot check email

-          Cannot check voice mail

-          Cannot do any project/lab related work

-          Will not get paid unless Congress authorizes back pay

Again, this information is based on a handful of replies. I have no further information but you can reply to the list and maybe get a your own personal correspondence going.

Regards,
Bill

Can anyone share the status of government-funded projects related to building sciences and energy? Are any of you .gov-types even getting paid right now?
Maybe the people that would know anything can't even check their email, or are home working on that novel they've always wanted to write...

Good afternoon, Nick,

Correct on both counts. I believe the thinking is that Addendum I aligns
more closely with the variable exterior lighting requirements based on the
project's location (e.g. urban, rural, etc) so it seemed appropriate to
adopt this addendum for SSc8 calculations for LEED projects. Since EAp2-c1
is not required to follow any specific addenda, it is permissible to use the
unmodified calculations to determine the allowance for the baseline case.

Have a great day!

Cam

Hi there,

 

I came across a strange thing on a LEEDv3 (v2009) project. One team was working on SSc8 and the other on EAc1. While the exterior lighting power density should be calculated in accordance with A90.1-2007, section 9, Table
1 in both cases, the SSc8 template (referring in the description field to
A90.1-2007) was automatically looking up A90.1-2010 values (allowable LPD) while EAc1, table 1.4 was using A90.1-2007 values. I know that usually the LEED reviewer flags (cross-checks SSc8 vs EAc1 ext. lighting calcs) this if inconsistency is found. Has anyone experienced a mistake like this???...and how did you resolve it???

 

Thanks,

Norbert

Thanks again, Cam!

This clarification is immediately helpful for a current project I'm working on, and I'm sure almost any other project seeking SSc8 alongside energy model credits.

Good afternoon, Nick,

Correct on both counts. I believe the thinking is that Addendum I aligns more closely with the variable exterior lighting requirements based on the project's location (e.g. urban, rural, etc) so it seemed appropriate to adopt this addendum for SSc8 calculations for LEED projects. Since EAp2-c1 is not required to follow any specific addenda, it is permissible to use the unmodified calculations to determine the allowance for the baseline case.

Have a great day!

Cam

Hi Cam, thanks for the input!

I've re-read your response a few times and would like to be sure I fully understand.  Would you please confirm (or otherwise correct) the following statements?  

1. Where SSc8 documentation must follow addendum i to calculate the exterior lighting power allowance, the baseline energy model for EAp2/EAc1 may optionally document a differing exterior lighting power allowance per
90.1-2007 without addendum i.  

2. Proposed exterior lighting power should match between SSc8 documentation and the EAp2/EAc1 Proposed energy model, for any case.

Thank you,

~Nick

Good morning, all,

Although Addendum I must be used for projects registered after the cited date, the Baseline exterior lighting power allowance may still be calculated bases on 90.1-2007 without addendum i. If using the revised baseline for SSc8, only the reported proposed exterior lighting power must be reported identically. The new Supplemental Section 1.4 Tables spreadsheet automatically calculates the baseline exterior lighting allowance using this methodology.

Have a great day!

I ran into this face first a few months back - see attached attempt at a heads up for more information.

In short, the SSc8 templates are based around 90.1-2007 addendum i, note LEED is a bit misleading and incorrectly calls it addendum 1.

If your project was registered prior to November of 2011 you might be able to make a case to use the pre-addenda calculations.

I anticipate otherwise your SSc8 team needs to re-do their calculations, and you'll need to update your model's proposed/baseline figures in kind.

Sorry for the probably-bad news =(,

~Nick

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energyplus Schedules and Daylight Saving Time
Message-ID: <CAKKdj8_R6D90+C1BjL53v9RxFHKicNZxvxg=ykfPMM96-DTvcg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

Can someone explain to me why energyplus behaves the way that it does when
daylight saving time is used?

Specifically, scheduled values are shifted in the following way:
In a simulation, during DST, (summer), a schedule with 24 unique values for
a single day will have values [2:24] used during hours 1:23, and value [1]
used during hour 24. The first part seems reasonable, shift scheduled
values back by one hour, but the last part seems wrong, shifting a
scheduled value from hour 1 to hour 24 of the same day.

Since I'm doing controls studies, and I use schedules to define when some
systems are on or off, this issue is particularly troubling. When I intend
for a system to be ON during hour 1 and OFF during hour 2, the schedule is
adjusted by energyplus so that during the simulation the system is OFF
during hour 1, and ON during hour 24...not exactly what I intended.

Have any other users experienced this? Any suggestions for a workaround? I
would like to have DST in effect, so that occupancy, lighting schedules,
equipment schedules, etc. are correct relative to the sun's position and
the local weather conditions - and I would ALSO like for my controls
schedules to be used as intended, not shifted forward or backward, so that
when I schedule a system to be ON during hour 1, it is ON during hour 1,
whether it's winter or summer in simulation.

An example file and complete results are attached; file description and
results sample are included below.

Cheers,
Ryan

----
I've attached an example IDF that demonstrates the issue, as well as the
CSV output, my file is adapted from the example
file: 1ZoneUncontrolledResLayers.idf; I made the following changes:
1. added a RUNPERIODCONTROL:DAYLIGHTSAVINGTIME object that applies DST from
March 5 to November 5
2. added a schedule:compact object called DST_test_schedule
**this schedule has the following format, each hour for each day has a
unique value which should match that day and time; so the value for March
2, hour 5 is 3.0205, the value for March 4, hour 7 is 3.0407, etc.
3. added an output for the above schedule, removed all other outputs
4. removed annual runperiod, added two shorter runperiods that encompass
the DST start and end dates.

In the InputOutputReference, the following note is provided:
----
Note: For EnergyPlus Output:Variable and Output:Meter reporting, the time
stamps are always in standard time. When daylight saving time is active,
scheduled loads and controls will shift one hour relative to standard time.
----
**this is not accurate, since MOST values are shifted (backward) by 1 hour,
but values scheduled during hour 1 are shifted (forward) by 23 hours.

Ryan,
The E+ "hour" value is the hour preceding the value.  e.g., Hour 1 is 00:01 - 1:00
That means if you move everything back one hour, what previously was 00:01 - 01:00 becomes 23:01 - 24:00.  It should not be the same day, but does it make an important difference for two hours out of the year?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energyplus Schedules and Daylight Saving Time

Greetings,

Can someone explain to me why energyplus behaves the way that it does when daylight saving time is used?

Specifically, scheduled values are shifted in the following way:
In a simulation, during DST, (summer), a schedule with 24 unique values for a single day will have values [2:24] used during hours 1:23, and value [1] used during hour 24. The first part seems reasonable, shift scheduled values back by one hour, but the last part seems wrong, shifting a scheduled value from hour 1 to hour 24 of the same day.

Since I'm doing controls studies, and I use schedules to define when some systems are on or off, this issue is particularly troubling. When I intend for a system to be ON during hour 1 and OFF during hour 2, the schedule is adjusted by energyplus so that during the simulation the system is OFF during hour 1, and ON during hour 24...not exactly what I intended.

Have any other users experienced this? Any suggestions for a workaround? I would like to have DST in effect, so that occupancy, lighting schedules, equipment schedules, etc. are correct relative to the sun's position and the local weather conditions - and I would ALSO like for my controls schedules to be used as intended, not shifted forward or backward, so that when I schedule a system to be ON during hour 1, it is ON during hour 1, whether it's winter or summer in simulation.

An example file and complete results are attached; file description and results sample are included below.

Cheers,
Ryan

----
I've attached an example IDF that demonstrates the issue, as well as the CSV output, my file is adapted from the example file: 1ZoneUncontrolledResLayers.idf; I made the following changes:
1. added a RUNPERIODCONTROL:DAYLIGHTSAVINGTIME object that applies DST from March 5 to November 5
2. added a schedule:compact object called DST_test_schedule
**this schedule has the following format, each hour for each day has a unique value which should match that day and time; so the value for March 2, hour 5 is 3.0205, the value for March 4, hour 7 is 3.0407, etc.
3. added an output for the above schedule, removed all other outputs
4. removed annual runperiod, added two shorter runperiods that encompass the DST start and end dates.

In the InputOutputReference, the following note is provided:
----
Note: For EnergyPlus Output:Variable and Output:Meter reporting, the time stamps are always in standard time. When daylight saving time is active, scheduled loads and controls will shift one hour relative to standard time.
----
**this is not accurate, since MOST values are shifted (backward) by 1 hour, but values scheduled during hour 1 are shifted (forward) by 23 hours.

Hi Jim,
For my controls investigations, it makes a difference every day during the
DST period, specifically I'm optimizing window open/close schedules for
natural ventilation - and when the windows open at hour 24 instead of hour
1, on a given day (say, on a day x it's a good idea to open windows at hour
1, and a bad idea to open them at hour 24) it really screws with my
results.

For a generic repeating schedule, i agree that it doesn't make much
difference in an annual simulation, but i'm looking at specific days, and
sometimes using actual weather data - so it really is important that i get
the controls implemented on the right day, at the right time.

Thanks for your help,
Ryan

Ryan,
How about setting Daylight Savings to OFF, then build your operation schedules to (manually) offset during DST?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energyplus Schedules and Daylight Saving Time

Greetings,

Can someone explain to me why energyplus behaves the way that it does when daylight saving time is used?

Specifically, scheduled values are shifted in the following way:
In a simulation, during DST, (summer), a schedule with 24 unique values for a single day will have values [2:24] used during hours 1:23, and value [1] used during hour 24. The first part seems reasonable, shift scheduled values back by one hour, but the last part seems wrong, shifting a scheduled value from hour 1 to hour 24 of the same day.

Since I'm doing controls studies, and I use schedules to define when some systems are on or off, this issue is particularly troubling. When I intend for a system to be ON during hour 1 and OFF during hour 2, the schedule is adjusted by energyplus so that during the simulation the system is OFF during hour 1, and ON during hour 24...not exactly what I intended.

Have any other users experienced this? Any suggestions for a workaround? I would like to have DST in effect, so that occupancy, lighting schedules, equipment schedules, etc. are correct relative to the sun's position and the local weather conditions - and I would ALSO like for my controls schedules to be used as intended, not shifted forward or backward, so that when I schedule a system to be ON during hour 1, it is ON during hour 1, whether it's winter or summer in simulation.

An example file and complete results are attached; file description and results sample are included below.

Cheers,
Ryan

I've attached an example IDF that demonstrates the issue, as well as the CSV output, my file is adapted from the example file: 1ZoneUncontrolledResLayers.idf; I made the following changes:
1. added a RUNPERIODCONTROL:DAYLIGHTSAVINGTIME object that applies DST from March 5 to November 5
2. added a schedule:compact object called DST_test_schedule
**this schedule has the following format, each hour for each day has a unique value which should match that day and time; so the value for March 2, hour 5 is 3.0205, the value for March 4, hour 7 is 3.0407, etc.
3. added an output for the above schedule, removed all other outputs
4. removed annual runperiod, added two shorter runperiods that encompass the DST start and end dates.

In the InputOutputReference, the following note is provided:
----
Note: For EnergyPlus Output:Variable and Output:Meter reporting, the time stamps are always in standard time. When daylight saving time is active, scheduled loads and controls will shift one hour relative to standard time.
----
**this is not accurate, since MOST values are shifted (backward) by 1 hour, but values scheduled during hour 1 are shifted (forward) by 23 hours.

Jim,

Another example: suppose a building needs 8 hours to pre-cool before
occupancy on a Monday in order to meet comfort requirements, and the
cooling system is off on weekends. With the current energyplus DST
schedule-shifting, your building will only get 7-hours of pre-cooling on
Monday morning, and will get an extra hour of cooling on Friday night.

schedule might look something like:
For: Weekdays,
Until: 8:00,
1,
Until: 24,
0,
For: Weekends,
Until: 24:00,
0,

Interesting findings Ryan. 

I'm also working with Daylight Saving Time in EnergyPlus because we're doing hourly calibration on short run period. If I understand well, the results from your csv file should be

 03/05  23:00:00, 3.0524

 03/05  24:00:00, 3.0601

 03/06  01:00:00, 3.0602

Instead of

 03/05  23:00:00, 3.0524

 03/05  24:00:00, 3.0501

 03/06  01:00:00, 3.0602

 

I agree this could be problematic if schedule values differs from 24h to 1h.

I tested differently.  Instead of using a compact schedule definition as you did, I used a Schedule:File object using the same naming value as you proposed (See attached scheduleFile attached). I taught that maybe the wording (Throught : mm/dd) in compact schedule definition could be the cause. But no, It react the same... With Schedule:file object definition, I got also

 03/05  23:00:00, 3.0524

 03/05  24:00:00, 3.0501

 03/06  01:00:00, 3.0602

 

Good to know

Jim,

 

Another example: suppose a building needs 8 hours to pre-cool before occupancy on a Monday in order to meet comfort requirements, and the cooling system is off on weekends. With the current energyplus DST schedule-shifting, your building will only get 7-hours of pre-cooling on Monday morning, and will get an extra hour of cooling on Friday night.

 

schedule might look something like:

For: Weekdays,

Until: 8:00,

1,

Until: 24,

0,

For: Weekends,

Until: 24:00,

0,

...

Hi Jim,

For my controls investigations, it makes a difference every day during the DST period, specifically I'm optimizing window open/close schedules for natural ventilation - and when the windows open at hour 24 instead of hour 1, on a given day (say, on a day x it's a good idea to open windows at hour 1, and a bad idea to open them at hour 24) it really screws with my results. 

 

For a generic repeating schedule, i agree that it doesn't make much difference in an annual simulation, but i'm looking at specific days, and sometimes using actual weather data - so it really is important that i get the controls implemented on the right day, at the right time.

 

Thanks for your help,

Ryan

Ryan,

The E+ "hour" value is the hour preceding the value.  e.g., Hour 1 is 00:01 - 1:00

That means if you move everything back one hour, what previously was 00:01 - 01:00 becomes 23:01 - 24:00.  It should not be the same day, but does it make an important difference for two hours out of the year?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Energyplus Schedules and Daylight Saving Time

 

Greetings,

 

Can someone explain to me why energyplus behaves the way that it does when daylight saving time is used?

 

Specifically, scheduled values are shifted in the following way:

In a simulation, during DST, (summer), a schedule with 24 unique values for a single day will have values [2:24] used during hours 1:23, and value [1] used during hour 24. The first part seems reasonable, shift scheduled values back by one hour, but the last part seems wrong, shifting a scheduled value from hour 1 to hour 24 of the same day. 


 

Since I'm doing controls studies, and I use schedules to define when some systems are on or off, this issue is particularly troubling. When I intend for a system to be ON during hour 1 and OFF during hour 2, the schedule is adjusted by energyplus so that during the simulation the system is OFF during hour 1, and ON during hour 24...not exactly what I intended.

 

Have any other users experienced this? Any suggestions for a workaround? I would like to have DST in effect, so that occupancy, lighting schedules, equipment schedules, etc. are correct relative to the sun's position and the local weather conditions - and I would ALSO like for my controls schedules to be used as intended, not shifted forward or backward, so that when I schedule a system to be ON during hour 1, it is ON during hour 1, whether it's winter or summer in simulation.

 

An example file and complete results are attached; file description and results sample are included below.

 

Cheers,

Ryan

 

----

I've attached an example IDF that demonstrates the issue, as well as the CSV output, my file is adapted from the example file: 1ZoneUncontrolledResLayers.idf; I made the following changes:

1. added a RUNPERIODCONTROL:DAYLIGHTSAVINGTIME object that applies DST from March 5 to November 5

2. added a schedule:compact object called DST_test_schedule

**this schedule has the following format, each hour for each day has a unique value which should match that day and time; so the value for March 2, hour 5 is 3.0205, the value for March 4, hour 7 is 3.0407, etc.

3. added an output for the above schedule, removed all other outputs

4. removed annual runperiod, added two shorter runperiods that encompass the DST start and end dates.

 

In the InputOutputReference, the following note is provided: 

----

Note: For EnergyPlus Output:Variable and Output:Meter reporting, the time stamps are always in standard time. When daylight saving time is active, scheduled loads and controls will shift one hour relative to standard time.

----

**this is not accurate, since MOST values are shifted (backward) by 1 hour, but values scheduled during hour 1 are shifted (forward) by 23 hours.

BLDG-simers -

The University of Idaho Integrated Design Lab is happy to announce that we've posted a new, free EnergyPlus tool to our website and we'd love your feedback.

https://sites.google.com/site/idlbsug/modeling-resources/idf-objects/uiidl_hvac-template-generator

The tool is an OpenOffice, macro-enabled spreadsheet that will generate the required text objects for the various HVAC template systems available to EnergyPlus.  The tool also allows batch input of multiple objects to help streamline the specification of large models with numerous zones.  Give it a try!   The page also includes an instructional YouTube video on how to use the tool.

Please post comments, or email me with questions, suggestions, or thoughts!  Hope you like the tool and find it to be useful!

Cheers!

Our technical presentation will be given by Oliver Davis and Matt Brown from concept 3D, the developers of the upcoming Simuwatt Audit tool.

This software is being developed in partnership with NREL and will incorporate geometric capture, the Building Component Library, OpenStudio and EnergyPlus. The purpose is to standardize the commercial building energy audit process, to make it more collaborative and consistent, and to reduce the cost for investment-grade energy audits.

Hi All,

We need to collect data for a complete building modelling project from building owners that are not very familiar with the subject. We already have access to various more or less personal input forms, with no or very cursory descriptions of each data item. I expect almost every modeler and company has their own.

What I am looking for is a template where each data item is explained and more carefully defined (in English). It seems to be the sort of thing that must have been developed by, e.g., ASHRAE at some point (and I should probably be well aware of :-).

Gratefully,

Per

Dear all,
Does anyone of you know a software program which I can use to calculate the energy needs of a building (installed power) at an early stage (design). With the usual programs like EnergyPlus or Trnsys you need to insert a lot of parameters to get the information, parameters which  just aren?t allways available in the design stage.
The calculations don?t have to be very precise, I?m looking for a tool which can give an acceptable result, so we can give our customer an idea of how much power is needed for a certain building.

Greatfully,

Bentley Systems' AECOsim Energy Simulator has a conceptual mode - about 10 inputs (mostly from drop-down boxes), draw the outline of the footprint, select from a dozen preconfigured HVAC system (drag-and-drop components, all 90.1 required baseline and budget systems), and simulate.  And it uses EnergyPlus.  Once your conceptual model is ready, you can modify all the default parameters.

Message-ID: <007801cecfda$89cda920$9d68fb60$@put.poznan.pl>

Dear All,

 

Dou you have some experience with modeling accumulation stove in buildings.

 

I think about stove which is driven by electricity or biomass, similar to
titled stove (attachment).

 

I think about two ways to simulate it:

1)      Zone heat gain,

2)      Walls with temperature as boundary condition (temperature of the
stove surface)

 

What do you think about this idea?

 

There is also issue, how can I model the  heat generation in stove to take
into account accumulation and dependence on biomass burning? 

 

Kind regards,

Karol

Hello,

If by energy need you are referring to energy consumption (Wh), I would suggest to go with RETScreen. 
If you are referring to cooling/heating loads (W) try Design Builder. 
Downside is that you can't get block load for entire building. (Maybe this issue is resolved with newer version).
HAP can also do the job.
Cheers,Sasa Pantic

Another option to consider, if you are already familiar with Sketchup, is the free IES-VE Ware plugin.  Similar in function to what's been described for AECOSim, but from my experience I'll caution you WILL want to plan on time to create the model from scratch.

Hello,

If by energy need you are referring to energy consumption (Wh), I would suggest to go with RETScreen. 
If you are referring to cooling/heating loads (W) try Design Builder. 
Downside is that you can't get block load for entire building. (Maybe this issue is resolved with newer version).
HAP can also do the job.

Hi Jens,

I would support Sasa's recommendation to consider DesignBuilder for the application you have suggested, adding that you can easily do both loads calculations and simulations to determine power and energy consumption from the various energy systems in the building such as HVAC, lighting and equipment. You can create the building geometry and define internal gains, HVAC (via simplified schematic drag-and-drop or menu options) etc. quickly and easily for early-stage analysis (there are many free online tutorials showing how to do this), and then develop the complexity of it as your design matures.

Regards,

Dave

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Accounting for plenums/technical ceilings
Message-ID: <CAPAgWczXEdaTEUQWfVb3XzKSumofFGuF9vqy--krisxBj1i5Fg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

How do people generally account for plenums or technical ceilings? I'm not
referring here to plenums used for air circulation, but closed ceiling
space that is not considered as part of a volume to heat or cool for load
calculations.

- Do you model them as separate spaces?
- Do you ignore them (but how then do you preserve the building's geometry)?
- Some other option?
- And for those using EnergyPlus, do you use the "ceiling height" field of
the Zone object? The documentation says that this generates a warning if
the ceiling height and calculated ceiling height differ too much, whatever
too much is.

The building I'm working on has a 1.1 m (3.6 ft)  difference between the
space ceiling height and the height of the floor above, so it's not
something I can ignore.

Thanks for your feedback,
Patrick

Some of you may know that I use EnergyPro for this sort of thing.  You 
can build a very simple building if you want to.  A box.  Window area.  
Internal people and lighting.  If it is multi-story you can multiply the 
floors, just like EQuest and the rest.

I suppose the most important thing is the weather file, and EnergyPro 
has many to choose from, and everywhere in California where I work.  For 
me, in California, it is the obvious choice.

Bentley Systems' AECOsim Energy Simulator has a conceptual mode - about 10 inputs (mostly from drop-down boxes), draw the outline of the footprint, select from a dozen preconfigured HVAC system (drag-and-drop components, all 90.1 required baseline and budget systems), and simulate.  And it uses EnergyPlus.  Once your conceptual model is ready, you can modify all the default parameters.

Hello Patrick,
The plenum areas of the building certainly need to be taken into account in the model and there are cooling and heating loads associatiated with plenums even if they are not conditioned. While they may not be used as a return plenum, there will still be a heat transfer between the plenum and all of the adjacent surfaces, especially the exterior wall and the ceiling. These heat transfers can also affect the occupied space load as there is an exchange through the ceiling. To answer your first question, plenums are typically modeled as separate spaces, yes. The height of the plenum should equal the floor to floor height minus the ceiling height. All of the math should add up so that the exterior wall heat transfers are correctly accounted for.

I recommend consulting the ASHRAE 90.1 users manual for more information on accounting for different definitions of spaces and partition types.

Cheers,

All,
This has been a great thread.  My experience has been that the early stage
models for building orientation and envelope optimization are not of much
use, other than the insight gained from the exercise, when you move from
that phase of the project to system sizing and equipment selection during
the design phase, whether your are working with a manual input workflow
into a simulation tool or trying to automate the input through Sketchup,
Revit, Bentley, ArchiCAD, etc.  Load calculations, equipment sizing, air
distribution system device and distribution system design and selection
pretty much demand room-by-room analysis.  Its hard to take conceptual
models, exterior surface area models, massing and "shoe-box" models and
grow them into room-by-room models using the same original input files.

I agree with Dennis.  Typically the design evolves so much between the need for conceptual modeling and the more discrete system sizing modeling, I end up building a new model.  With that in mind, I still think the eQuest wizards are the easiest and quickest way to run conceptual model options.  Then I move to IES VE for my more detailed modeling.

All,
This has been a great thread.  My experience has been that the early stage models for building orientation and envelope optimization are not of much use, other than the insight gained from the exercise, when you move from that phase of the project to system sizing and equipment selection during the design phase, whether your are working with a manual input workflow into a simulation tool or trying to automate the input through Sketchup, Revit, Bentley, ArchiCAD, etc.  Load calculations, equipment sizing, air distribution system device and distribution system design and selection pretty much demand room-by-room analysis.

Bentley Systems' AECOsim Energy Simulator has a conceptual mode - about 10 inputs (mostly from drop-down boxes), draw the outline of the footprint, select from a dozen preconfigured HVAC system (drag-and-drop components, all 90.1 required baseline and budget systems), and simulate.  And it uses EnergyPlus.  Once your conceptual model is ready, you can modify all the default parameters.

Fyi.

In DOE-2-based simulations modeling a plenum can have +- issues. For example if you model a space as a plenum then the loads in/out of the space do not show in LOADS only in SYSTEMS as a heat gain/loss to/from the plenum only when the air is flowing in the plenum. Also, there is no thermostat setting for the plenum and the load is not included in the sum of space loads.

On the other hand if you model it as an unconditioned zone then you can see the floating temperature, but it is not conditioned.

Finally, you can also model it as a space with a wider dead band so the system never comes on/off.

So, either way has its pros and cons.

This is easy to test with the SAMP1e.inp file that is distributed with DOE-2.

Hello Patrick,
The plenum areas of the building certainly need to be taken into account in the model and there are cooling and heating loads associatiated with plenums even if they are not conditioned. While they may not be used as a return plenum, there will still be a heat transfer between the plenum and all of the adjacent surfaces, especially the exterior wall and the ceiling. These heat transfers can also affect the occupied space load as there is an exchange through the ceiling. To answer your first question, plenums are typically modeled as separate spaces, yes. The height of the plenum should equal the floor to floor height minus the ceiling height. All of the math should add up so that the exterior wall heat transfers are correctly accounted for.

I recommend consulting the ASHRAE 90.1 users manual for more information on accounting for different definitions of spaces and partition types.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Accounting for plenums/technical ceilings

Hi all,

How do people generally account for plenums or technical ceilings? I'm not referring here to plenums used for air circulation, but closed ceiling space that is not considered as part of a volume to heat or cool for load calculations.

- Do you model them as separate spaces?
- Do you ignore them (but how then do you preserve the building's geometry)?
- Some other option?
- And for those using EnergyPlus, do you use the "ceiling height" field of the Zone object? The documentation says that this generates a warning if the ceiling height and calculated ceiling height differ too much, whatever too much is.

The building I'm working on has a 1.1 m (3.6 ft)  difference between the space ceiling height and the height of the floor above, so it's not something I can ignore.

Thanks for your feedback,
Patrick

For very simple and fast schematic and concetual performance analysis I
recomend Project Vasari, which is free and specially designed for energy
analysis in early stages.

Its simulation engine is DOE 2, and you can export equest and e+ input
files for later more detailed analysis. Another usefull caracteristic is
automated results representation and cloud parametric analysis of 50 design
alternatives every time you simulate, determining the impact on energy of
the different parameters compared the original design.

Hope it helps

Regards, Santiago.

Karol,

 

I haven?t modeled such a stove myself, but here are my thoughts for what
they?re worth.  While explicit modeling of an accumulation stove would be
very complex, I think that approximating one in an energy model is
reasonable.  It is essentially just a radiant/convective source of direct
heat in the space, with some sort of fuel input and efficiency associated
with it.  For the discussion below, I?ll assume the fuel is biomass.  

 

If I were doing this I would model it as an electric resistance heater in
the room, with an efficiency applied to it that reflects the average
efficiency of the stove.  I don?t know about other programs, but in TRACE it
is possible to apply an efficiency to electric resistance heating.  Other
programs may assume 100% efficiency for resistance heat, in which case you
would have to do a little bit of additional calculation outside the program.
I would take the heating energy usage calculated by the program and convert
from kWh to lbs of wood or whatever measure of the biomass fuel you choose.
This would require some research on the energy density of the fuel.  

 

There are a few key factors to consider:

 

1.       Efficiency.  In a woodstove, this is a moving target, depending on
how dry the fuel is, how much combustion air is available, how hot the fire
is allowed to burn, and the inherent characteristics of the stove.  In
considering efficiency, you should consider combustion efficiency, latent
heat loss due to moisture in the fuel, and sensible losses up the flue.

2.       Combustion air.  The stove needs combustion air.  This will most
likely come in the form of infiltration into the space.  Wood needs about 12
ft? of combustion air for each 1000 BTU of input fuel energy.  It is not
unreasonable to expect the stove to use around 100% excess air.  That means
that for every 1000 BTUs of input fuel used, you need to account for about
24 ft? of infiltration into the space.  

3.       Stove operation.  Will the stove be operated to maintain a steady
indoor temperature 24 hours per day?  If so you can just give the room a
single set point temperature.  If the stove operation will be more
intermittent, you may need to create a temperature set point schedule which
reflects the actual temperature fluctuations in the space.  

4.       Thermal mass.  The mass of the stove serves to even out its heat
output over the course of several hours.  Without modeling the inner
workings of the stove explicitly, I think this effect can be
approximated/estimated using the set point temperature schedule mentioned
above.   

5.       Is there another heating system serving the same space?  If so,
then my suggestions don?t apply as cleanly, if at all.

 

I should say that I?m not a biomass expert.  I?m just interested in the
topic.  The information I provide about wood combustion are based on
documents I?ve read from the Masonry Heater Association and elsewhere.

 

I hope this helps,

Christian

Dear All,

 

Dou you have some experience with modeling accumulation stove in buildings.

 

I think about stove which is driven by electricity or biomass, similar to
titled stove (attachment).

 

I think about two ways to simulate it:

1)      Zone heat gain,

2)      Walls with temperature as boundary condition (temperature of the
stove surface)

 

What do you think about this idea?

 

There is also issue, how can I model the  heat generation in stove to take
into account accumulation and dependence on biomass burning? 

 

Kind regards,

Karol

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LBNL releases version 1.5 build 1 of the Modelica
 "Buildings" library and version 1.3.0 of the "BuildingsPy" Python package
Message-ID: <CACXXVchxo2PTfz8z7dtS8rhj5VZ_8_nEoMpx3Khzfeoaw8jT3g@mail.gmail.com>

LBNL releases version 1.5 build 1 of the Modelica "Buildings" library and
version 1.3.0 of the "BuildingsPy" Python package.

Version 1.5 build 1 is a major release that contains new packages with
models for solar collectors and for the Facility for Low Energy Experiments
(FLEXLAB) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

This release also contains a major revision of all info sections to correct
invalid html syntax. The package Buildings.HeatTransfer.Radiosity has been
revised to fully comply with the Modelica language specification. This
release also contains various corrections that avoid warnings during
translation when used with Modelica 3.2.1. (By default, Modelica 3.2 is
used, but the library is compatible with Modelica 3.2.1.) Various models
have been revised to increase compatibility with OpenModelica. However,
currently only a subset of the models work with OpenModelica.

For a detailed list of changes, see
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/v1.5+build.1/help/Buildings_UsersGuide_ReleaseNotes.html

In BuildingsPy 1.3.0, stricter tests for running the unit tests have been
implemented. The unit tests now check for better conformance with the
Modelica Language Specification. They also validate the html syntax of the
Modelica documentation. The package DyMat that is used by BuildingsPy to
read Dymola output files has been updated to the latest version.

For more information and download, visit
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/

Thanks for your answers. I found a specific section, 2.2.9, in the COMNET
guidelines Shanta directed me to:

(...) Because of the leakage through the ceiling (typically suspended), the

> the temperature of the space, except that it is generally warmer because

I guess the part I'm interested in is acceptable simplifications. And
perhaps modelling tricks, that might be software specific.

Now a bit of context. I'm working on a 40 storey high building. That's
quite a few plenums to model, which add a lot of surfaces simply by being
there and by breaking up spaces that could have been grouped vertically
into continuous thermal zones. I was wondering if there was a better way of
approaching this to keep the model simple and the surface count down. Or do
I just have to suck it up?

An example of simplification I thought of, with EnergyPlus, is to model
space and plenum as a single space but setting the Ceiling Height field of
the Zone object to the height below plenum. It's acceptable in terms of air
changes in the space according to the documentation. It removes a lot of
surfaces and allows to group spaces into continuous vertical thermal zones.
But a part of the heat transfers through external walls that would normally
affect the plenum will be accounted for in the space itself. Acceptable
simplification? Unnecessary optimisation?

Thanks,
Patrick

I've been reading the postings on this thread, but have resisted chiming 
in until now :-)

Although modeling a plenum is appealing from the point of physical 
verisimilitude, there are actually some drawbacks depending on which 
simulation program is being used.  With DOE-2, adding a plenum on the 
top floor converts the ceiling to an internal surface, for which DOE-2 
models only conductive heat flows, thus losing the direct radiant 
exchange between the roof bottom and ceiling top.  I'm still 
investigating the impact this has on the simulations, but the 
preliminary indications are that it underestimates the impact of 
measures affecting the roof reflectivity, such as a "Cool Roof".

The other thought I have is that while the COMNET description quoted 
below is physically correct, much of it (stratification, leakage through 
the ceiling, etc.) are ignored in the building simulations.  For all 
intensive purposes, a plenum in DOE-2 or EnergyPlus is simply an 
unconditioned or a partially conditioned zone if it contains ducts (and 
the ducts are modeled).

As far as modeling tricks, adding a plenum to DOE-2 or eQUEST does not 
add much of a modeling burden if a FLOOR-MULTIPLIER is used to describe 
a typical floor + plenum.  Similarly, with EnergyPlus, you can create a 
ZoneList containing all the spaces on one floor plus a plenum above, and 
then give the Zone List a multiplier.

If you want to omit the plenum, I would still make the exterior wall 
area include the plenum height, but maybe reduce the air volume of the 
space as you've described.  I know that's not a problem in DOE-2, but I 
don't know whether EnergyPlus would allow you to do so, i.e., the input 
zone volume is less than that enclosed by the surfaces.  I don't think 
you'll go terribly wrong, but I would still think that having a plenum 
would be preferable.

Jens,
Target Finder and Portfolio manager are great tools with a rich set of data
behind them.  Bear in mind that they are based on statistical analysis of
2003 CBECS reference data and are going to return total annual numbers -
not something like monthly consumption and peak demand. Those tools do not
make assumptions about occupancy, schedules, equipment, etc.  They also do
not make any assumptions about the activities that may be present in your
design or proposed building.  The tools normalize the data from their
reference database based on your design inputs to generate a median EUI and
either a score or target EUI for your building or proposed design.  We've
done some modeling of about half of the DOE reference buildings in all 16
climate zones to see if a model can be tuned/calibrated to mimic the output
from Target Finder and Portfolio Manager for a median building.  Since
occupancy, schedule, activity, fuel mix, climate zone, ventilation,
envelope characteristics all have an impact you can chase your tail for a
long time trying to get a precise match.  We've also done some sensitivity
analysis on those variables across climate zones. Depending on climate
zone, any one of those variable can swing the numbers significantly off the
median.  Then there is the issue of site versus source EUI's.  In some of
our analysis the numbers for some buildings and climate zones correlate
closely with site numbers and in others with the source EUI numbers.  If
you are wanting to provide your client with at least high level decision
making information on total energy annual consumption and maximum peak
demand for all your fuel sources I think you still need a baseline model.
 That model can be as simple as four walls, a roof, some basic schedules
and setpoints.  Most of the tools allow you to set that up fairly quickly.
 The difficulty I've noted on a previous post to this question is that
often this early stage model is not able to evolve into a design phase
model without significant modification and it is often just as easy to
create a new design level model.

I agree too.   Models that can change as the design evolve are a huge challenge.

In presentations I give on challenges of doing energy simulation, I describe a corporate HQ project that I worked on (a LONG time ago).  We started in predesign, looking shape - a very long linear building that we rotated and did a number of simulations on shape.  By schematic design the building had changed to L-shaped... more simulations...  When we got to conceptual design that become an H.  In design development, the owner decided to incorporate a 50 kW data center. By the end of construction documents, the building was X-shaped with a central atrium...  Keeping up with these changes throughout design is a real challenge.  About all that stays the same are your space types, the location, and maybe some other settings.

I agree with Dennis.  Typically the design evolves so much between the need for conceptual modeling and the more discrete system sizing modeling, I end up building a new model.  With that in mind, I still think the eQuest wizards are the easiest and quickest way to run conceptual model options.  Then I move to IES VE for my more detailed modeling.

All,
This has been a great thread.  My experience has been that the early stage models for building orientation and envelope optimization are not of much use, other than the insight gained from the exercise, when you move from that phase of the project to system sizing and equipment selection during the design phase, whether your are working with a manual input workflow into a simulation tool or trying to automate the input through Sketchup, Revit, Bentley, ArchiCAD, etc.  Load calculations, equipment sizing, air distribution system device and distribution system design and selection pretty much demand room-by-room analysis.  Its hard to take conceptual models, exterior surface area models, massing and "shoe-box" models and grow them into room-by-room models using the same original input files.  I'm very interested in what you all have to say about this process and does any of these tools make the transition from concept to full blown design any less painfull?

Bentley Systems' AECOsim Energy Simulator has a conceptual mode - about 10 inputs (mostly from drop-down boxes), draw the outline of the footprint, select from a dozen preconfigured HVAC system (drag-and-drop components, all 90.1 required baseline and budget systems), and simulate.  And it uses EnergyPlus.  Once your conceptual model is ready, you can modify all the default parameters.

Dear all,
Does anyone of you know a software program which I can use to calculate the energy needs of a building (installed power) at an early stage (design). With the usual programs like EnergyPlus or Trnsys you need to insert a lot of parameters to get the information, parameters which  just aren't allways available in the design stage.
The calculations don't have to be very precise, I'm looking for a tool which can give an acceptable result, so we can give our customer an idea of how much power is needed for a certain building.

1.       Came to learn about plenums.

2.       Learned the phrase "physical verisimilitude."

3.       Will be spending the rest of the day digging for an excuse to slip this phrase into everyday conversation....

Thanks, Joe!

The implications for rooftop radiant exchange are intriguing by the way and could immediately impact a few current projects of mine... Would be interested to learn the results of your investigation!

More to the original topic, I agree there's more than one right answer with respect to liberties of simplification a modeler can reasonably leverage.  So long as you do account for the corresponding perimeter envelope loads and are mindful of the conditioned volume, I think you're on solid ground in many cases to omit the plenums explicitly.  On the flip side (speaking specifically to the eQuest interface), especially if you are using floor multipliers, you'd likely spend much less time actually modeling the plenums.

For further reading, the [equest-users] archives have many threads discussing plenums, interstitial floors, and heat transfer implications.  You might pick up some new ideas and food for thought there ;).

If you want to omit the plenum, I would still make the exterior wall area include the plenum height, but maybe reduce the air volume of the space as you've described.  I know that's not a problem in DOE-2, but I don't know whether EnergyPlus would allow you to do so, i.e., the input zone volume is less than that enclosed by the surfaces.  I don't think you'll go terribly wrong, but I would still think that having a plenum would be preferable.

I was wondering if there was a better way of approaching this to keep the model simple and the surface count down. Or do I just have to suck it up?

An example of simplification I thought of, with EnergyPlus, is to model space and plenum as a single space but setting the Ceiling Height field of the Zone object to the height below plenum. It's acceptable in terms of air changes in the space according to the documentation. It removes a lot of surfaces and allows to group spaces into continuous vertical thermal zones. But a part of the heat transfers through external walls that would normally affect the plenum will be accounted for in the space itself. Acceptable simplification? Unnecessary optimisation?

Thanks,
Patrick

For ceiling plenums under conditioned spaces or well insulated roofs, I generally agree that they are not worth the effort.  Whenever I try to get smarter about modeling plenums I come back to the lack of information on plenums in 90.1 ECB and Appendix G.   These are clearly design decision but how should they be accounted for.  It is a strategy to have a plenum, to have ducted returns, to have recessed lighting, etc?

1.       Came to learn about plenums.

2.       Learned the phrase "physical verisimilitude."

3.       Will be spending the rest of the day digging for an excuse to slip this phrase into everyday conversation....

Thanks, Joe!

The implications for rooftop radiant exchange are intriguing by the way and could immediately impact a few current projects of mine... Would be interested to learn the results of your investigation!

More to the original topic, I agree there's more than one right answer with respect to liberties of simplification a modeler can reasonably leverage.  So long as you do account for the corresponding perimeter envelope loads and are mindful of the conditioned volume, I think you're on solid ground in many cases to omit the plenums explicitly.  On the flip side (speaking specifically to the eQuest interface), especially if you are using floor multipliers, you'd likely spend much less time actually modeling the plenums.

For further reading, the [equest-users] archives have many threads discussing plenums, interstitial floors, and heat transfer implications.  You might pick up some new ideas and food for thought there ;).

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Accounting for plenums/technical ceilings

I've been reading the postings on this thread, but have resisted chiming in until now :-)

Although modeling a plenum is appealing from the point of physical verisimilitude, there are actually some drawbacks depending on which simulation program is being used.  With DOE-2, adding a plenum on the top floor converts the ceiling to an internal surface, for which DOE-2 models only conductive heat flows, thus losing the direct radiant exchange between the roof bottom and ceiling top.  I'm still investigating the impact this has on the simulations, but the preliminary indications are that it underestimates the impact of measures affecting the roof reflectivity, such as a "Cool Roof".

The other thought I have is that while the COMNET description quoted below is physically correct, much of it (stratification, leakage through the ceiling, etc.) are ignored in the building simulations.  For all intensive purposes, a plenum in DOE-2 or EnergyPlus is simply an unconditioned or a partially conditioned zone if it contains ducts (and the ducts are modeled).

As far as modeling tricks, adding a plenum to DOE-2 or eQUEST does not add much of a modeling burden if a FLOOR-MULTIPLIER is used to describe a typical floor + plenum.  Similarly, with EnergyPlus, you can create a ZoneList containing all the spaces on one floor plus a plenum above, and then give the Zone List a multiplier.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] method for extracting transmissivity from thermal
	comfort results
Message-ID: <CAOQXAFCnrDEWn3it8Pi2ygU_fARh=kVv5BavDfgpJAXk1dSe1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm hoping to find a method that can be implemented in Excel for extracting
a glazing transmittance from two or more sets of temperature results.

*Our problem:*
We assess simulated comfort criteria where operative temperatures in a zone
above 27degC must be in the 1%-ile or less. We extract a *glazing
transmission* that will 'only just' meet this criterion from two or more
sets of results. We have limited access to parametric runs, hence only two
or more sets of thermal modelling results.

*What we've used up to now:*
In order to 'roughly' evaluate the solar transmissivity that helps achieve
this criterion we have used TREND and other functions for curve fitting in
excel to interpolate a transmissivity from two or more sets of results.

We have two problems with this approach:
1. such a narrow band of results are being focused on so the calc is
subject to inaccuracies
2. our modelling software is limited to one hour timesteps and can only
report temperatures in 1 degree intervals

*Possible solution?*
My gut fee is that we can extract the information more reliably from a
broader band of data. Is there an approach that looks at the spread of
temperature distribution from, say, 25 to 28 degC for two or more result
sets and extracts the transmissivity that matches the 1%-ile.

*Is there such a method?*

Minor note: We limit changes to glazing absorptance between our parametric
runs, aiming for only changes in transmissivity and reflectance. We have
found operative temperatures to increase with higher glazing absorptance.

Best regards

Chris

Message-ID: <002801ced4a7$af043ac0$0d0cb040$@sudassociates.com>

Hello Group,

Does anyone know of any articles/papers/publications which address peak
design loads for buildings as energy codes evolve?  I am looking for basic
rules of thumb for sf/ton (cooling) and btuh/sf (heating).  People use these
rules of thumb all the time for initial assessments, sanity checks on
simulation results, etc, but I'm not sure that the rules of thumb are being
updated as energy codes become more aggressive.  For example, the engineers
I have been around since I entered the engineering world (granted, that was
only a few years ago) seem to always go back to 400 sf/ton as a standard
value, then adjust up or down depending on building characteristics.  I
haven't seen this  number change as buildings improve, or as I move to
different climate zones.  To be clear, I am interested in design loads, not
annual energy usage.

(Note:  Before anyone lambasts me for even bringing up rules of thumb for
design, I'll go ahead and say that I know they are gross estimations at
best, and should be used with extreme caution and judgment.  Nonetheless, I
see them used all the time, so I might as well get as good numbers as I can.
And a project I am on right now actually requires it (by owner) in
preliminary design.)

Thanks for your help,
Christian

Dear Christian,
I do not know of any such resources!  
What do you think about creating a "typical" building and trying out various envelope, lighting, plug load and HVAC options in your climate to see the impact of each? That should not be too daunting a task.

Jim,

Thanks.  Yes, I can do my own little study, and I can also just look back at
results from past projects.  That's a good suggestion.  But I was hoping to
have something credible to reference (outside my own firm) for the owner.  I
have seen DOE/National Lab comparisons of annual energy usage between the
different versions of 90.1...I was hoping there might be something similar
for design loads.

Thanks,
Christian

Dear Christian,
I do not know of any such resources!  
What do you think about creating a "typical" building and trying out various
envelope, lighting, plug load and HVAC options in your climate to see the
impact of each? That should not be too daunting a task.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] New Rules of Thumb for Design Loads

Hello Group,

Does anyone know of any articles/papers/publications which address peak
design loads for buildings as energy codes evolve?  I am looking for basic
rules of thumb for sf/ton (cooling) and btuh/sf (heating).  People use these
rules of thumb all the time for initial assessments, sanity checks on
simulation results, etc, but I'm not sure that the rules of thumb are being
updated as energy codes become more aggressive.  For example, the engineers
I have been around since I entered the engineering world (granted, that was
only a few years ago) seem to always go back to 400 sf/ton as a standard
value, then adjust up or down depending on building characteristics.  I
haven't seen this  number change as buildings improve, or as I move to
different climate zones.  To be clear, I am interested in design loads, not
annual energy usage.

(Note:  Before anyone lambasts me for even bringing up rules of thumb for
design, I'll go ahead and say that I know they are gross estimations at
best, and should be used with extreme caution and judgment.  Nonetheless, I
see them used all the time, so I might as well get as good numbers as I can.
And a project I am on right now actually requires it (by owner) in
preliminary design.)

Thanks for your help,
Christian

I suspect that you and your company are very credible and shouldn't hesitate to claim the truth of that.  Your client probably would not have retained you if that were not true!  It would be nice to have a 1000 building study from DOE, though :)
I wonder why your client is asking?  There are so many design possibilities and at the end of the day, design load affects only equipment size (including the electricity and fuel services).  These, in turn, can be "managed" by choices for insulation, lighting, etc.  
Another thing to consider (after assessing your firm's liability from lawsuits) is that design loads occur infrequently in most climates, so much so that a full energy model analysis can sometimes show that the impact on comfort is minimal for a nominally UNDERsized HVAC system.
It's a tangled web!  I think I'd ask the basis of their concern about peak load.

Don't the DOE reference buildings sort of fit that bill?   16 building types/16 climate zone?

I looked at the results for small office for Baltimore and was able to calculate 650 ft2/ton for cooling.... and I see enough data to do similar for heating, peak demand, etc.

You could use the DOE reference buildings, although these are not "designed" buildings, they only exist in model space...so as a designer I wouldn't use the peak loads necessarily, but maybe the ratio of peak load would be interesting across the code versions.

David, Dru, Jim,

Thanks.  I will consider the DOE reference buildings as an option, at least
for comparison.

Jim, to answer your questions without getting into project details...We have
been asked to give our opinion on the expected loads for a proposed building
so the owner can have an idea of what impact it will have on their central
plants.  We'll do this based primarily on similar past projects of ours.
However, the owner has an on-site engineer who is using very old ASHRAE
documentation to come up with his own (very high) design load estimates.
Apparently ASHRAE used to publish sf/ton guidance for office buildings?  I
would like to have some more current documentation to show the engineer to
help support my explanation of why our prediction will be lower than his.
Also, I think my wording concerning credibility came out wrong.  I certainly
wasn't implying that my company isn't highly capable/credible.  But it's
always nice to have a DOE report as backup documentation!

Thanks for your help,
Christian

Dear Christian,
I do not know of any such resources!  
What do you think about creating a "typical" building and trying out various
envelope, lighting, plug load and HVAC options in your climate to see the
impact of each? That should not be too daunting a task.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] New Rules of Thumb for Design Loads

Hello Group,

Does anyone know of any articles/papers/publications which address peak
design loads for buildings as energy codes evolve?  I am looking for basic
rules of thumb for sf/ton (cooling) and btuh/sf (heating).  People use these
rules of thumb all the time for initial assessments, sanity checks on
simulation results, etc, but I'm not sure that the rules of thumb are being
updated as energy codes become more aggressive.  For example, the engineers
I have been around since I entered the engineering world (granted, that was
only a few years ago) seem to always go back to 400 sf/ton as a standard
value, then adjust up or down depending on building characteristics.  I
haven't seen this  number change as buildings improve, or as I move to
different climate zones.  To be clear, I am interested in design loads, not
annual energy usage.

(Note:  Before anyone lambasts me for even bringing up rules of thumb for
design, I'll go ahead and say that I know they are gross estimations at
best, and should be used with extreme caution and judgment.  Nonetheless, I
see them used all the time, so I might as well get as good numbers as I can.
And a project I am on right now actually requires it (by owner) in
preliminary design.)

Thanks for your help,
Christian

Descriptions

Presentation 1

Title: Data Visualization at Urban Scale - NY Energy Consumption Map

Bianca Howard, Ph.D Candidate, Sustainable Engineering Studio, Columbia
University

Bianca?s talk will discuss the methods behind estimating annual building
energy consumption for New York City and the many iterations of visualizing
this information. She will also discuss the analysis for estimating the
potential for Combined Heat and Power at both the building and "microgrid"
scales which illustrates how the building energy consumption estimates were
utilized in her research.

About the Speaker: Bianca Howard is currently a Ph.D. Candidate in
mechanical engineering in the Sustainable Engineering Lab of Professor
Vijay Modi at Columbia University. She is also a trainee in the National
Science Foundation IGERT ?Solving Urbanization Challenges Through Design?.

Her research interests are in energy systems and evaluating various methods
of reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Recently her
work has been focused on the viability of combined heat and power in New
York City as well as estimating emissions reductions from changes in the
electricity load profile at the hourly time scale. The evaluation of
combined heat and power at both the building and microgrid scale has its
foundations in previous works of estimating building energy consumption for
the 5 boroughs.

Ms. Howard received her Bachelor?s of Science in Mechanical Engineering
from the University of Nebraska in 2009 and her Master?s of Science in
Mechanical Engineering from Columbia University in 2011.


Presentation 2

Title: CityEngine - GIS Based Data Visualization for Urban Scale
Developments

Patrick Gahagan, Solutions Engineer, ESRI, New York City

Esri's procedural or rule-based modeling software City Engine allows design
professionals to be creative and still meet sustainability goals.   City
Engine delivers a full suite of industry-leading procedural tools to
aggregate geospatial data, layout and edit street networks, generate and
modify buildings, and analyze urban planning projects.

Building Performance Simulation can be achieved in short order using City
Engine and templates that are created by the City Engine team. The Redlands
Redevelopment example is one of these templates and showcases an advanced
set of analytical tools created in response to the growing need for
measurable, performance-based design.

This presentation will provide an introduction to the City Engine
interface, and then focus on some of the eco-criteria and other performance
targets included with the Redlands Redevelopment example.  The reports
generated by City Engine on these performance targets provide instant
feedback to the designer, and enables the rapid launch of community design
and implementation strategies.

About the Speaker: Patrick Gahagan is a Solutions Engineer for Esri based
in New York City.  For many years he supported clients in NYC  government,
but has always kept a specialty in 3D GIS.  Patrick now supports clients in
the AEC and general 3D markets just about full time.   He was one of the
early internal adopters of City Engine, and has become an unofficial east
coast member of the 3D team at headquarters.

Those old rules of thumb can mean significantly higher capital cost. I
remember a project in the DC area about 20 years ago. Their rules of thumb
came up with 10,000 tons (yeah a big building) ... but when a colleague did
a back of the envelope calc (in the days before we even hope for low-energy
buildings), he came up with 3,000 tons... and that was very conservative.
So the owner was about to (and did) pay for 3x the size needed and I'm
willing to bet the building rarely goes over 2,000 tons.

Sometimes I think we get too caught up in the modeling.  Why not simply provide a manual block load analysis for the proposed building, with basic allowances for lighting, equipment, envelope loads, etc.  You could even provide both old school values like 2 W/SF for lighting vs. 1 W/SF today to show the building engineer why the values have dropped.  A one page summary of expected loads would provide all involved a snapshot of where the cooling loads are coming from, list assumptions, and possibly even identify areas for additional attention.  The building engineer could help define a "safety factor" to be included if desired.  Taking another step back in time, I believe the 1975 (first) ASHRAE energy code only required an average R3 window/wall insulation and R12 roof insulation.  We have come a long way!

Jim, to answer your questions without getting into project details...We have
been asked to give our opinion on the expected loads for a proposed building
so the owner can have an idea of what impact it will have on their central
plants.  We'll do this based primarily on similar past projects of ours.
However, the owner has an on-site engineer who is using very old ASHRAE
documentation to come up with his own (very high) design load estimates.
Apparently ASHRAE used to publish sf/ton guidance for office buildings?  I
would like to have some more current documentation to show the engineer to
help support my explanation of why our prediction will be lower than his.
Also, I think my wording concerning credibility came out wrong.  I certainly
wasn't implying that my company isn't highly capable/credible.  But it's
always nice to have a DOE report as backup documentation!

Thanks for your help,
Christian

Christian,
I suspect that you and your company are very credible and shouldn't hesitate
to claim the truth of that.  Your client probably would not have retained
you if that were not true!  It would be nice to have a 1000 building study
from DOE, though :) I wonder why your client is asking?  There are so many
design possibilities and at the end of the day, design load affects only
equipment size (including the electricity and fuel services).  These, in
turn, can be "managed" by choices for insulation, lighting, etc.
Another thing to consider (after assessing your firm's liability from
lawsuits) is that design loads occur infrequently in most climates, so much
so that a full energy model analysis can sometimes show that the impact on
comfort is minimal for a nominally UNDERsized HVAC system.
It's a tangled web!  I think I'd ask the basis of their concern about peak
load.

Thanks.  Yes, I can do my own little study, and I can also just look back at
results from past projects.  That's a good suggestion.  But I was hoping to
have something credible to reference (outside my own firm) for the owner.  I
have seen DOE/National Lab comparisons of annual energy usage between the

Subject: [Bldg-sim] New Rules of Thumb for Design Loads

Hello Group,

Does anyone know of any articles/papers/publications which address peak
design loads for buildings as energy codes evolve?  I am looking for basic
rules of thumb for sf/ton (cooling) and btuh/sf (heating).  People use these
rules of thumb all the time for initial assessments, sanity checks on
simulation results, etc, but I'm not sure that the rules of thumb are being
updated as energy codes become more aggressive.  For example, the engineers
I have been around since I entered the engineering world (granted, that was
only a few years ago) seem to always go back to 400 sf/ton as a standard
value, then adjust up or down depending on building characteristics.  I
haven't seen this  number change as buildings improve, or as I move to
different climate zones.  To be clear, I am interested in design loads, not
annual energy usage.

(Note:  Before anyone lambasts me for even bringing up rules of thumb for
design, I'll go ahead and say that I know they are gross estimations at
best, and should be used with extreme caution and judgment.  Nonetheless, I
see them used all the time, so I might as well get as good numbers as I can.
And a project I am on right now actually requires it (by owner) in
preliminary design.)

Thanks for your help,
Christian

I think there's been some conflating of annual energy simulations with loads calculations. 
To me, the big difference is not in their techniques, but their objectives, and it bothers 
me when I read posts suggesting that loads calculations can be done with rules of thumb, 
simple manual calculations, etc., which reminds me of what a DOE officer opined in a 
meeting one time that residential equipment were sized with the "door method", i.e., 
"whatever fits through the door".

In my opinion, both should be (and are being) done with equal rigor.  In fact, most of the 
dynamic calculation methods (cooling load temp. difference, response factors, radiant time 
series, etc.) were developed for load calculations, and only later extended to annual 
simulations.   From what I know, there are plenty of load calculation tools that rely on 
dynamic simulations, the main difference from annual simulations being what they assume 
for the building internal conditions and the outdoor conditions.  For an annual 
simulation, those are designed to be as representative or typical as possible of actual 
conditions.  For load calculations, these are the near worst case conditions (e.g., for 
heating - no internal loads, 99.6% climate conditions, no sun, etc.) to derive the peak 
loads, to which safety factors are often added.

When people persist in using per floor area loads, is that any different than estimating 
the annual consumption using fixed kBTU/ft2-yr numbers?  Does anyone think that either is 
credible?  As far as oversizing HVAC equipment, there are several factors at play - use of 
outdated "rules of thumb" derived  when buildings were leakier (but cooling intensities 
might actually be lower), overly conservative design conditions (as I once said to the 
owner of the Agenda 21 Building in Beijing - the peak load derived by his engineer assumes 
that you're hosting a conference in your building on the hottest day of the year), and the 
proverbial 30% safety factor.  Leaving aside the first factor, the latter two should 
explain all the differences between what a loads calculation program shows and the peak 
loads from an annual simulation.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that we should promote better load calculations rather 
than simply update "rules of thumb" or develop simple manual methods for the 
computer-challenged engineers.  Furthermore, as buildings improve, such simple methods are 
apt to be progressively less reliable.

In the case of large commercial buildings the cooling energy depends on
occupancy types & internal loads and winter energy depends on ventilation
rates (hospitals).  Weather has little effect because of the envelope
efficiency standards. 
It is possible to have cooling energy rules of (many) thumbs for different
types of commercial buildings.

Dear Christian,
I do not know of any such resources!  
What do you think about creating a "typical" building and trying out various
envelope, lighting, plug load and HVAC options in your climate to see the
impact of each? That should not be too daunting a task.

Christian -



If the key issue is the vintage of the ASHRAE information used to estimate the loads per square foot - I am curious if ASHRAE has updated the loads per square foot check figures published in their ASHRAE Pocket Guide<http://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/products/1703568>. I have a 2001 and 2009 vintage: the 2009 version updates the Expected Lighting & Equipment Heat Gain (Office goes from 4 / 6/ 9 W/sf to 2 / 2.5 / 4 W/sf, low/med/hi) but keeps the expected Refrigeration density the same (360 / 280 / 190 sq ft / ton).



I wonder if the Refrigeration values in the current edition match the refrigeration values in the reference your client's in-house engineer is using.

David, Dru, Jim,



Thanks.  I will consider the DOE reference buildings as an option, at least for comparison.



Jim, to answer your questions without getting into project details...We have been asked to give our opinion on the expected loads for a proposed building so the owner can have an idea of what impact it will have on their central plants.  We'll do this based primarily on similar past projects of ours.

However, the owner has an on-site engineer who is using very old ASHRAE documentation to come up with his own (very high) design load estimates.

Apparently ASHRAE used to publish sf/ton guidance for office buildings?  I would like to have some more current documentation to show the engineer to help support my explanation of why our prediction will be lower than his.

Also, I think my wording concerning credibility came out wrong.  I certainly wasn't implying that my company isn't highly capable/credible.  But it's always nice to have a DOE report as backup documentation!



Thanks for your help,

Christian,

I suspect that you and your company are very credible and shouldn't hesitate to claim the truth of that.  Your client probably would not have retained you if that were not true!  It would be nice to have a 1000 building study from DOE, though :) I wonder why your client is asking?  There are so many design possibilities and at the end of the day, design load affects only equipment size (including the electricity and fuel services).  These, in turn, can be "managed" by choices for insulation, lighting, etc.

Another thing to consider (after assessing your firm's liability from

lawsuits) is that design loads occur infrequently in most climates, so much so that a full energy model analysis can sometimes show that the impact on comfort is minimal for a nominally UNDERsized HVAC system.

It's a tangled web!  I think I'd ask the basis of their concern about peak load.

Jim,



Thanks.  Yes, I can do my own little study, and I can also just look back at results from past projects.  That's a good suggestion.  But I was hoping to have something credible to reference (outside my own firm) for the owner.  I have seen DOE/National Lab comparisons of annual energy usage between the different versions of 90.1...I was hoping there might be something similar for design loads.



Thanks,

Christian

Dear Christian,

I do not know of any such resources!

What do you think about creating a "typical" building and trying out various envelope, lighting, plug load and HVAC options in your climate to see the impact of each? That should not be too daunting a task.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] New Rules of Thumb for Design Loads



Hello Group,



Does anyone know of any articles/papers/publications which address peak design loads for buildings as energy codes evolve?  I am looking for basic rules of thumb for sf/ton (cooling) and btuh/sf (heating).  People use these rules of thumb all the time for initial assessments, sanity checks on simulation results, etc, but I'm not sure that the rules of thumb are being updated as energy codes become more aggressive.  For example, the engineers I have been around since I entered the engineering world (granted, that was only a few years ago) seem to always go back to 400 sf/ton as a standard value, then adjust up or down depending on building characteristics.  I haven't seen this  number change as buildings improve, or as I move to different climate zones.  To be clear, I am interested in design loads, not annual energy usage.



(Note:  Before anyone lambasts me for even bringing up rules of thumb for design, I'll go ahead and say that I know they are gross estimations at best, and should be used with extreme caution and judgment.  Nonetheless, I see them used all the time, so I might as well get as good numbers as I can.

And a project I am on right now actually requires it (by owner) in preliminary design.)



Thanks for your help,

Christian

..and now that Joe makes me think a bit more....
A block load calculation can be done VERY quickly.  Why bother with rules of thumb when a few minutes more gives you a fully customized load?

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] New Rules of Thumb for Design Loads

I think there's been some conflating of annual energy simulations with loads calculations. To me, the big difference is not in their techniques, but their objectives, and it bothers me when I read posts suggesting that loads calculations can be done with rules of thumb, simple manual calculations, etc., which reminds me of what a DOE officer opined in a meeting one time that residential equipment were sized with the "door method", i.e., "whatever fits through the door".

In my opinion, both should be (and are being) done with equal rigor.  In fact, most of the dynamic calculation methods (cooling load temp. difference, response factors, radiant time series, etc.) were developed for load calculations, and only later extended to annual simulations.   From what I know, there are plenty of load calculation tools that rely on dynamic simulations, the main difference from annual simulations being what they assume for the building internal conditions and the outdoor conditions.  For an annual simulation, those are designed to be as representative or typical as possible of actual conditions.  For load calculations, these are the near worst case conditions (e.g., for heating - no internal loads, 99.6% climate conditions, no sun, etc.) to derive the peak loads, to which safety factors are often added.

When people persist in using per floor area loads, is that any different than estimating the annual consumption using fixed kBTU/ft2-yr numbers?  Does anyone think that either is credible?  As far as oversizing HVAC equipment, there are several factors at play - use of outdated "rules of thumb" derived  when buildings were leakier (but cooling intensities might actually be lower), overly conservative design conditions (as I once said to the owner of the Agenda 21 Building in Beijing - the peak load derived by his engineer assumes that you're hosting a conference in your building on the hottest day of the year), and the proverbial 30% safety factor.  Leaving aside the first factor, the latter two should explain all the differences between what a loads calculation program shows and the peak loads from an annual simulation.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that we should promote better load calculations rather than simply update "rules of thumb" or develop simple manual methods for the computer-challenged engineers.  Furthermore, as buildings improve, such simple methods are apt to be progressively less reliable.

Sometimes I think we get too caught up in the modeling.  Why not simply provide a manual block load analysis for the proposed building, with basic allowances for lighting, equipment, envelope loads, etc.  You could even provide both old school values like 2 W/SF for lighting vs. 1 W/SF today to show the building engineer why the values have dropped.  A one page summary of expected loads would provide all involved a snapshot of where the cooling loads are coming from, list assumptions, and possibly even identify areas for additional attention.  The building engineer could help define a "safety factor" to be included if desired.  Taking another step back in time, I believe the 1975 (first) ASHRAE energy code only required an average R3 window/wall insulation and R12 roof insulation.  We have come a long way!

Those old rules of thumb can mean significantly higher capital cost. I remember a project in the DC area about 20 years ago. Their rules of thumb came up with 10,000 tons (yeah a big building) ... but when a colleague did a back of the envelope calc (in the days before we even hope for low-energy buildings), he came up with 3,000 tons... and that was very conservative.  So the owner was about to (and did) pay for 3x the size needed and I'm willing to bet the building rarely goes over 2,000 tons.

David, Dru, Jim,

Thanks.  I will consider the DOE reference buildings as an option, at least
for comparison.

Jim, to answer your questions without getting into project details...We have
been asked to give our opinion on the expected loads for a proposed building
so the owner can have an idea of what impact it will have on their central
plants.  We'll do this based primarily on similar past projects of ours.
However, the owner has an on-site engineer who is using very old ASHRAE
documentation to come up with his own (very high) design load estimates.
Apparently ASHRAE used to publish sf/ton guidance for office buildings?  I
would like to have some more current documentation to show the engineer to
help support my explanation of why our prediction will be lower than his.
Also, I think my wording concerning credibility came out wrong.  I certainly
wasn't implying that my company isn't highly capable/credible.  But it's
always nice to have a DOE report as backup documentation!

Thanks for your help,
Christian

Message-ID: <CAOQXAFBx6wo+cf2+5_ahDrbwTNs6Ly2FPJ2J3jhe1-LZ_4PJBw@mail.gmail.com>

Re-posted (Not sure if the original got on the list?)

Dear all,

I'm hoping to find a method that can be implemented in Excel for extracting
a glazing transmittance from two or more sets of temperature results.

*Our problem:*
We assess simulated comfort criteria where operative temperatures in a zone
above 27degC must be in the 1%-ile or less. We extract a *glazing
transmission* that will 'only just' meet this criterion from two or more
sets of results. We have limited access to parametric runs, hence only two
or more sets of thermal modelling results.

*What we've used up to now:*
In order to 'roughly' evaluate the solar transmissivity that helps achieve
this criterion we have used TREND and other functions for curve fitting in
excel to interpolate a transmissivity from two or more sets of results.

We have two problems with this approach:
1. such a narrow band of results are being focused on so the calc is
subject to inaccuracies
2. our modelling software is limited to one hour timesteps and can only
report temperatures in 1 degree intervals

*Possible solution?*
My gut fee is that we can extract the information more reliably from a
broader band of data. Is there an approach that looks at the spread of
temperature distribution from, say, 25 to 28 degC for two or more result
sets and extracts the transmissivity that matches the 1%-ile.

*Is there such a method?*

Minor note: We limit changes to glazing absorptance between our parametric
runs, aiming for only changes in transmissivity and reflectance. We have
found operative temperatures to increase with higher glazing absorptance.

Best regards

Chris

being said.  On the value/appropriateness of rules of thumb for design:  I
fully agree that rules of thumb are not appropriate as a basis for actual
design.  I run computer simulated loads on a regular basis.  These often
take many hours of effort.  They are tailored specifically to what is
needed, whether it is plant size (chiller/boiler), AHU coil and fan sizes,
or VAV box/duct/diffuser sizes.  Each of these design needs require a
different modeling approach.  I can't imagine suggesting an equipment
purchase based on rules of thumb, and we never have.  It is even going
quickly out of style among HVAC contractors in the residential world. 

 

However, I do think that rules of thumb are very valuable and appropriate in
certain situations, and I would argue that almost every engineer uses them
whether or not they are conscious of it.  For instance, if I told you that I
designed an office building that consumes 2 kBTU/sf/yr and doesn't have any
renewable energy system, probably every person on this list would want a
little explanation.  That's because, based on years of accrued experience,
you know the reasonable range of annual energy consumption that can be
expected from an office building.  Further, your assessment that a 2
kBTU/sf/yr building needs some explaining took you about 1 second of
analysis.  That can be done on the fly, in a phone conversation with a less
technical or less experienced person who may not have any idea that this
value is unusual.  And the more experienced you gain, the more reliable your
mental assessments can be.  We have an engineer here that always seems to
know (within a few percent) what the results of my calculations will be long
before I get a final result.  And he will know immediately if there is
something fishy about my assumptions.  There are many times when it is
useful to know a reasonable range of values for design loads for a
particular building type without needing to do a block load or a full
simulation.

 

I was just hoping there might be a document which had compared design loads
between different versions of 90.1, similar to the energy comparisons that
have been done, so that I could have it in my back pocket.

 

Thanks for the lively responses!

..and now that Joe makes me think a bit more..

A block load calculation can be done VERY quickly.  Why bother with rules of
thumb when a few minutes more gives you a fully customized load?

I think there's been some conflating of annual energy simulations with loads
calculations. To me, the big difference is not in their techniques, but
their objectives, and it bothers me when I read posts suggesting that loads
calculations can be done with rules of thumb, simple manual calculations,
etc., which reminds me of what a DOE officer opined in a meeting one time
that residential equipment were sized with the "door method", i.e.,
"whatever fits through the door".  

In my opinion, both should be (and are being) done with equal rigor.  In
fact, most of the dynamic calculation methods (cooling load temp.
difference, response factors, radiant time series, etc.) were developed for
load calculations, and only later extended to annual simulations.   From
what I know, there are plenty of load calculation tools that rely on dynamic
simulations, the main difference from annual simulations being what they
assume for the building internal conditions and the outdoor conditions.  For
an annual simulation, those are designed to be as representative or typical
as possible of actual conditions.  For load calculations, these are the near
worst case conditions (e.g., for heating - no internal loads, 99.6% climate
conditions, no sun, etc.) to derive the peak loads, to which safety factors
are often added.

When people persist in using per floor area loads, is that any different
than estimating the annual consumption using fixed kBTU/ft2-yr numbers?
Does anyone think that either is credible?  As far as oversizing HVAC
equipment, there are several factors at play - use of outdated "rules of
thumb" derived  when buildings were leakier (but cooling intensities might
actually be lower), overly conservative design conditions (as I once said to
the owner of the Agenda 21 Building in Beijing - the peak load derived by
his engineer assumes that you're hosting a conference in your building on
the hottest day of the year), and the proverbial 30% safety factor.  Leaving
aside the first factor, the latter two should explain all the differences
between what a loads calculation program shows and the peak loads from an
annual simulation.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that we should promote better load
calculations rather than simply update "rules of thumb" or develop simple
manual methods for the computer-challenged engineers.  Furthermore, as
buildings improve, such simple methods are apt to be progressively less
reliable.

Sometimes I think we get too caught up in the modeling.  Why not simply
provide a manual block load analysis for the proposed building, with basic
allowances for lighting, equipment, envelope loads, etc.  You could even
provide both old school values like 2 W/SF for lighting vs. 1 W/SF today to
show the building engineer why the values have dropped.  A one page summary
of expected loads would provide all involved a snapshot of where the cooling
loads are coming from, list assumptions, and possibly even identify areas
for additional attention.  The building engineer could help define a "safety
factor" to be included if desired.  Taking another step back in time, I
believe the 1975 (first) ASHRAE energy code only required an average R3
window/wall insulation and R12 roof insulation.  We have come a long way!

Those old rules of thumb can mean significantly higher capital cost. I
remember a project in the DC area about 20 years ago. Their rules of thumb
came up with 10,000 tons (yeah a big building) ... but when a colleague did
a back of the envelope calc (in the days before we even hope for low-energy
buildings), he came up with 3,000 tons... and that was very conservative.
So the owner was about to (and did) pay for 3x the size needed and I'm
willing to bet the building rarely goes over 2,000 tons.

David, Dru, Jim,

Thanks.  I will consider the DOE reference buildings as an option, at least
for comparison.

Jim, to answer your questions without getting into project details...We have
been asked to give our opinion on the expected loads for a proposed building
so the owner can have an idea of what impact it will have on their central
plants.  We'll do this based primarily on similar past projects of ours.
However, the owner has an on-site engineer who is using very old ASHRAE
documentation to come up with his own (very high) design load estimates.
Apparently ASHRAE used to publish sf/ton guidance for office buildings?  I
would like to have some more current documentation to show the engineer to
help support my explanation of why our prediction will be lower than his.
Also, I think my wording concerning credibility came out wrong.  I certainly
wasn't implying that my company isn't highly capable/credible.  But it's
always nice to have a DOE report as backup documentation!

Thanks for your help,
Christian

Christian,
I suspect that you and your company are very credible and shouldn't hesitate
to claim the truth of that.  Your client probably would not have retained
you if that were not true!  It would be nice to have a 1000 building study
from DOE, though :) I wonder why your client is asking?  There are so many
design possibilities and at the end of the day, design load affects only
equipment size (including the electricity and fuel services).  These, in
turn, can be "managed" by choices for insulation, lighting, etc.
Another thing to consider (after assessing your firm's liability from
lawsuits) is that design loads occur infrequently in most climates, so much
so that a full energy model analysis can sometimes show that the impact on
comfort is minimal for a nominally UNDERsized HVAC system.
It's a tangled web!  I think I'd ask the basis of their concern about peak
load.

Thanks.  Yes, I can do my own little study, and I can also just look back at
results from past projects.  That's a good suggestion.  But I was hoping to
have something credible to reference (outside my own firm) for the owner.  I
have seen DOE/National Lab comparisons of annual energy usage between the
different versions of 90.1...I was hoping there might be something similar

Dear Christian,
I do not know of any such resources!
What do you think about creating a "typical" building and trying out various
envelope, lighting, plug load and HVAC options in your climate to see the
impact of each? That should not be too daunting a task.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] New Rules of Thumb for Design Loads

Hello Group,

Does anyone know of any articles/papers/publications which address peak
design loads for buildings as energy codes evolve?  I am looking for basic
rules of thumb for sf/ton (cooling) and btuh/sf (heating).  People use these
rules of thumb all the time for initial assessments, sanity checks on
simulation results, etc, but I'm not sure that the rules of thumb are being
updated as energy codes become more aggressive.  For example, the engineers
I have been around since I entered the engineering world (granted, that was
only a few years ago) seem to always go back to 400 sf/ton as a standard
value, then adjust up or down depending on building characteristics.  I
haven't seen this  number change as buildings improve, or as I move to
different climate zones.  To be clear, I am interested in design loads, not
annual energy usage.

(Note:  Before anyone lambasts me for even bringing up rules of thumb for
design, I'll go ahead and say that I know they are gross estimations at
best, and should be used with extreme caution and judgment.  Nonetheless, I
see them used all the time, so I might as well get as good numbers as I can.
And a project I am on right now actually requires it (by owner) in
preliminary design.)

Thanks for your help,
Christian

Hello Chris,



There is a method and it works like crazy if it is applied correctly to certain classes of buildings.



It?s called an "inverse method". However, applying it to houses in mass is not yet prime time. ASHRAE has some guidance on inverse methods for commercial buildings  in the soon-to-be-published Guideline-14 . When this comes out it will include a copy of the FORTRAN RP1050 toolkit and the spreadsheet RP1093 toolkit. With the RP1050 toolkit you can apply ASHRAE linear and change-point linear models to energy usage data and extract the gross parameters that the 3p change-point models yield. ASHRAE's RP1050 also provides a variable based degree day model, which is the same as PRISM, the Princeton Scorekeeping method. These gross parameters have been shown to be useful in determining weather-dependent and weather-independent parameters for a building. There are even papers where there has been speculation that the PRISM parameters could be "mined" to dig further into the "inverse description" of a building, such as Ari Rabl's 1980s paper published in Energy and Building?s special PRISM volume, and the more recent work by Kissock et al. at the University of Dayton on residential.



Ongoing work at our lab will soon show that these methods can be further extended for certain classes of buildings to approach an automated audit that ?guesses? the most probably U-value and SHGC for a window, R-value for roofs, etc. So far we've had some success using this ?blind calibration? method. We?re expecting a PhD thesis on this in the Spring 2014.

Re-posted (Not sure if the original got on the list?)

Dear all,

I'm hoping to find a method that can be implemented in Excel for extracting a glazing transmittance from two or more sets of temperature results.

Our problem:
We assess simulated comfort criteria where operative temperatures in a zone above 27degC must be in the 1%-ile or less. We extract a glazing transmission that will 'only just' meet this criterion from two or more sets of results. We have limited access to parametric runs, hence only two or more sets of thermal modelling results.

What we've used up to now:
In order to 'roughly' evaluate the solar transmissivity that helps achieve this criterion we have used TREND and other functions for curve fitting in excel to interpolate a transmissivity from two or more sets of results.

We have two problems with this approach:
1. such a narrow band of results are being focused on so the calc is subject to inaccuracies
2. our modelling software is limited to one hour timesteps and can only report temperatures in 1 degree intervals

Possible solution?
My gut fee is that we can extract the information more reliably from a broader band of data. Is there an approach that looks at the spread of temperature distribution from, say, 25 to 28 degC for two or more result sets and extracts the transmissivity that matches the 1%-ile.

Is there such a method?

Minor note: We limit changes to glazing absorptance between our parametric runs, aiming for only changes in transmissivity and reflectance. We have found operative temperatures to increase with higher glazing absorptance.

Best regards

Chris

Maria,



The toolkits are the same as the original RP1050 and RP1093.



The only difference is that Guideline 14 will now include more examples and datasets for use with the toolkit. An update to the toolkit has been discussed with ASHRAE Technical committee TC 4.7. However, and RTAR and/or WS has yet to materialize. The proposed update would include a recompiling of the FORTRAN code, possible pre and post data processors, and additional models, (i.e., an inverse BIN model, a 6 parameter model, weighted models, and perhaps how to do a CP/PCA model).



I'll have to check on the status of the Guideline. Last I heard it was sitting at ASHRAE publications for final edit.

Jeff,

Is the Fortran toolkit that you mention below an updated / improved version of the toolkit released in ~ 2002, or is it the same program? And is there a timeframe for when the new version of Guideline 14 will be published?

Thank you,

Hello Chris,



There is a method and it works like crazy if it is applied correctly to certain classes of buildings.



It?s called an "inverse method". However, applying it to houses in mass is not yet prime time. ASHRAE has some guidance on inverse methods for commercial buildings  in the soon-to-be-published Guideline-14 . When this comes out it will include a copy of the FORTRAN RP1050 toolkit and the spreadsheet RP1093 toolkit. With the RP1050 toolkit you can apply ASHRAE linear and change-point linear models to energy usage data and extract the gross parameters that the 3p change-point models yield. ASHRAE's RP1050 also provides a variable based degree day model, which is the same as PRISM, the Princeton Scorekeeping method. These gross parameters have been shown to be useful in determining weather-dependent and weather-independent parameters for a building. There are even papers where there has been speculation that the PRISM parameters could be "mined" to dig further into the "inverse description" of a building, such as Ari Rabl's 1980s paper published in Energy and Building?s special PRISM volume, and the more recent work by Kissock et al. at the University of Dayton on residential.



Ongoing work at our lab will soon show that these methods can be further extended for certain classes of buildings to approach an automated audit that ?guesses? the most probably U-value and SHGC for a window, R-value for roofs, etc. So far we've had some success using this ?blind calibration? method. We?re expecting a PhD thesis on this in the Spring 2014.

Re-posted (Not sure if the original got on the list?)

Dear all,

I'm hoping to find a method that can be implemented in Excel for extracting a glazing transmittance from two or more sets of temperature results.

Our problem:
We assess simulated comfort criteria where operative temperatures in a zone above 27degC must be in the 1%-ile or less. We extract a glazing transmission that will 'only just' meet this criterion from two or more sets of results. We have limited access to parametric runs, hence only two or more sets of thermal modelling results.

What we've used up to now:
In order to 'roughly' evaluate the solar transmissivity that helps achieve this criterion we have used TREND and other functions for curve fitting in excel to interpolate a transmissivity from two or more sets of results.

We have two problems with this approach:
1. such a narrow band of results are being focused on so the calc is subject to inaccuracies
2. our modelling software is limited to one hour timesteps and can only report temperatures in 1 degree intervals

Possible solution?
My gut fee is that we can extract the information more reliably from a broader band of data. Is there an approach that looks at the spread of temperature distribution from, say, 25 to 28 degC for two or more result sets and extracts the transmissivity that matches the 1%-ile.

Is there such a method?

Minor note: We limit changes to glazing absorptance between our parametric runs, aiming for only changes in transmissivity and reflectance. We have found operative temperatures to increase with higher glazing absorptance.

Best regards

Chris

This has been a fascinating question and thread, a few thoughts from my
limited experience as a mechanical engineer/energy modeler:



-          First off, I am a huge fan of rules of thumbs for initial design
and estimation, I would never sign off on a design that is built around
them. I will use rules of thumbs for early on, then fully anticipate
running a full load analysis/energy model later.



-          Yes the rules of thumb are based on building codes and
regulations from 30+ years ago, but at least a vast majority of our work is
renovation work, so in some cases those rules of thumb are not that
outdated. Granted we are typically updating the envelope, HVAC
efficiencies, internal loads such as lighting, but in those initial design
phases and meetings where everyone is looking at you for an answer, a rule
of thumb is often all you have, and experience and knowledge of the project
can hopefully help you hone those numbers in. But initially they are very
helpful.



-          I have also learned the owner loves when the price comes down,
not up. So if I overestimate the sizes of equipment with my rules of thumb
and later tell everyone it?s actually lower once I started my detailed
calculations, everyone understands and everyone is happy. Undersizing my
equipment and adding cost to the budget later on in the design process is
awful.



-          Finally, with all the modulating technologies we have today
oversizing equipment isn?t as terrible, at least with hydronic systems, DX
is a little tougher. Modulating chillers, boilers, pumps, fans and outside
air intake can all match the load surprisingly well, allowing for slight
oversizing, especially in the case below of the massive conference on the
hottest day of the year. Granted if my fan static pressure is 3? I?m going
to slap 6? on it, but we do have some saving grace from modulation.

I think there's been some conflating of annual energy simulations with
loads calculations. To me, the big difference is not in their techniques,
but their objectives, and it bothers me when I read posts suggesting that
loads calculations can be done with rules of thumb, simple manual
calculations, etc., which reminds me of what a DOE officer opined in a
meeting one time that residential equipment were sized with the "door
method", i.e., "whatever fits through the door".

In my opinion, both should be (and are being) done with equal rigor.  In
fact, most of the dynamic calculation methods (cooling load temp.
difference, response factors, radiant time series, etc.) were developed for
load calculations, and only later extended to annual simulations.   From
what I know, there are plenty of load calculation tools that rely on
dynamic simulations, the main difference from annual simulations being what
they assume for the building internal conditions and the outdoor
conditions.  For an annual simulation, those are designed to be as
representative or typical as possible of actual conditions.  For load
calculations, these are the near worst case conditions (e.g., for heating -
no internal loads, 99.6% climate conditions, no sun, etc.) to derive the
peak loads, to which safety factors are often added.

When people persist in using per floor area loads, is that any different
than estimating the annual consumption using fixed kBTU/ft2-yr numbers?
Does anyone think that either is credible?  As far as oversizing HVAC
equipment, there are several factors at play - use of outdated "rules of
thumb" derived  when buildings were leakier (but cooling intensities might
actually be lower), overly conservative design conditions (as I once said
to the owner of the Agenda 21 Building in Beijing - the peak load derived
by his engineer assumes that you're hosting a conference in your building
on the hottest day of the year), and the proverbial 30% safety factor.
Leaving aside the first factor, the latter two should explain all the
differences between what a loads calculation program shows and the peak
loads from an annual simulation.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that we should promote better load
calculations rather than simply update "rules of thumb" or develop simple
manual methods for the computer-challenged engineers.  Furthermore, as
buildings improve, such simple methods are apt to be progressively less
reliable.

Sometimes I think we get too caught up in the modeling.  Why not simply
provide a manual block load analysis for the proposed building, with basic
allowances for lighting, equipment, envelope loads, etc.  You could even
provide both old school values like 2 W/SF for lighting vs. 1 W/SF today to
show the building engineer why the values have dropped.  A one page summary
of expected loads would provide all involved a snapshot of where the
cooling loads are coming from, list assumptions, and possibly even identify
areas for additional attention.  The building engineer could help define a
?safety factor? to be included if desired.  Taking another step back in
time, I believe the 1975 (first) ASHRAE energy code only required an
average R3 window/wall insulation and R12 roof insulation.  We have come a
long way!

Those old rules of thumb can mean significantly higher capital cost. I
remember a project in the DC area about 20 years ago. Their rules of thumb
came up with 10,000 tons (yeah a big building) ... but when a colleague did
a back of the envelope calc (in the days before we even hope for low-energy
buildings), he came up with 3,000 tons... and that was very conservative.
So the owner was about to (and did) pay for 3x the size needed and I'm
willing to bet the building rarely goes over 2,000 tons.

David, Dru, Jim,

Thanks.  I will consider the DOE reference buildings as an option, at least
for comparison.

Jim, to answer your questions without getting into project details...We have
been asked to give our opinion on the expected loads for a proposed building
so the owner can have an idea of what impact it will have on their central
plants.  We'll do this based primarily on similar past projects of ours.
However, the owner has an on-site engineer who is using very old ASHRAE
documentation to come up with his own (very high) design load estimates.
Apparently ASHRAE used to publish sf/ton guidance for office buildings?  I
would like to have some more current documentation to show the engineer to
help support my explanation of why our prediction will be lower than his.
Also, I think my wording concerning credibility came out wrong.  I certainly
wasn't implying that my company isn't highly capable/credible.  But it's
always nice to have a DOE report as backup documentation!

Thanks for your help,

Christian,
I suspect that you and your company are very credible and shouldn't hesitate
to claim the truth of that.  Your client probably would not have retained
you if that were not true!  It would be nice to have a 1000 building study
from DOE, though :) I wonder why your client is asking?  There are so many
design possibilities and at the end of the day, design load affects only
equipment size (including the electricity and fuel services).  These, in
turn, can be "managed" by choices for insulation, lighting, etc.
Another thing to consider (after assessing your firm's liability from
lawsuits) is that design loads occur infrequently in most climates, so much
so that a full energy model analysis can sometimes show that the impact on
comfort is minimal for a nominally UNDERsized HVAC system.
It's a tangled web!  I think I'd ask the basis of their concern about peak
load.

Jim,

Thanks.  Yes, I can do my own little study, and I can also just look back at
results from past projects.  That's a good suggestion.  But I was hoping to
have something credible to reference (outside my own firm) for the owner.  I
have seen DOE/National Lab comparisons of annual energy usage between the
different versions of 90.1...I was hoping there might be something similar
for design loads.

Dear Christian,
I do not know of any such resources!
What do you think about creating a "typical" building and trying out various
envelope, lighting, plug load and HVAC options in your climate to see the
impact of each? That should not be too daunting a task.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] New Rules of Thumb for Design Loads

Hello Group,

Does anyone know of any articles/papers/publications which address peak
design loads for buildings as energy codes evolve?  I am looking for basic
rules of thumb for sf/ton (cooling) and btuh/sf (heating).  People use these
rules of thumb all the time for initial assessments, sanity checks on
simulation results, etc, but I'm not sure that the rules of thumb are being
updated as energy codes become more aggressive.  For example, the engineers
I have been around since I entered the engineering world (granted, that was
only a few years ago) seem to always go back to 400 sf/ton as a standard
value, then adjust up or down depending on building characteristics.  I
haven't seen this  number change as buildings improve, or as I move to
different climate zones.  To be clear, I am interested in design loads, not
annual energy usage.

(Note:  Before anyone lambasts me for even bringing up rules of thumb for
design, I'll go ahead and say that I know they are gross estimations at
best, and should be used with extreme caution and judgment.  Nonetheless, I
see them used all the time, so I might as well get as good numbers as I can.
And a project I am on right now actually requires it (by owner) in
preliminary design.)

Thanks for your help,
Christian
