Hi again.

The acceptable illumination levels for non-residential buildings are prescribed in
"EN12464-1 Light and lighting - Lighting of work places - Part 1: Indoor work places".
To avoid excessive lighting, in Portuguese legislation the average illuminance level
shall not be exceeded by more than 30% from the standard prescribed illuminance.

Regards.

  Ah, this bridges the gap of understanding much better ? thanks for the example Ant?nio!  

   

  To date, I have not yet encountered a ?W/ft^2 per 10fc? requirement.  Our lighting power densities are typically prescribed more simply per space type or per building/project type to establish a ceiling for maximum installed lighting (for example: Offices are 0.9 W/ft^2, Parking Garages are 0.25W/ft^2).  The actual figures prescribed of course vary quite a bit depending on where you are and what energy standards/codes are being enforced (if any).

   

  In the USA, I have not LPD requirements tied additionally to targeted illumination levels (at least in such a direct fashion).  Does that mean in Europe, energy codes essentially prescribe acceptable illumination levels appropriate per space type or application, or is it still left up to the lighting designer/engineer to assert what?s appropriate?

  Hi, everyone.

   

  I think that we are talking about W/m^2 per 100 lux. This is the measure for maximum lighting power density (LPD) in some

  European countries regulations like from Portugal or Spain.

  An example: if the maintained average illuminance in a room is 300 lux and the maximum LPD per 100 lux is 2,5 W/m^2

  then the maximum LPD for that room is 7,5 W/m^2. 

  If you want a similar measure with US standard it will be something like W/ft^2 per 10 fc or other illuminance quantity.

   

  Best Regards.

    In Europe one sees W/m2-100 lux as a measure of lighting related gains or lighting efficiency. What is the equivalent here in the states? I suspect it is a messy conversion.

     

    Thank you in advance.

Hi

Has anyone seen the following two errors when simulating a model? 

I have no idea what it means so any suggestions on how to troubleshoot
would be welcomed. 

 

Thank you for your time!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] shady place simulation
Message-ID: <007b01cf817a$9142a190$b3c7e4b0$@put.poznan.pl>

Dear BPS Users and Developers,

I would like to model the zone that envelope is 'fully of holes', it
consists of only shading elements. Like space inside upper branches of a
tree or in the forest. 

So, there is no thermal insulation and air and heat can flow into and across
zone by natural ventilation, but sun radiation is limited.

I wonder if TRNSYS simulation (or other multizonal software, e.g. ESP-r,
EnergyPlus) can be appropriate to model such objects (inside thermal
comfort) or it is necessary to use CFD simulation.

I think to prepare zone (maybe a few airnodes) with very low thermal
resistance (or thermal properties of construction material, e.g. steel) and
with a lot of cracks in the walls, then to model shading elements using
shading zones.

Do you have some idea or some experience with such objects?
Any comments, hints and tips are appreciated!

Kind regards,
Karol

I think you could model this in IESVE using the macroflow application.  You would have to draw all the openings as windows rather than holes, and then set the windows to be open all the time.  This would allow for shading and air to pass through the space.  You could then export those flows for any point in time as boundary conditions to microflow to perform CFD and calculate the thermal comfort metrics.

Hi All,
I am working on calibrating a recreation center model and was wondering if
folks had a favorite formula to calculate the evaporation rate from an
indoor pool. I am getting quite a bit of range in the lbs/hr evaporated
based on different studies/calculators.
Thanks in advance and have a good weekend.

Hello Rohini,



One rather dated study that had measured daily amounts over an 18 month period is the study of the Rec Center at the University of Colorado:


Haberl, J., Claridge, D. 1987. ?An Expert System for Building Energy Consumption Analysis: Prototype Results,? ASHRAE Transactions-Research, Vol. 93, Pt. 1, pp. 979 - 998 ESL-PA-87-07-01 (July).

In this study we found that the day-to-day evaporation rates were small compared to the amount of water that got splashed out of the pool (i.e., usage).

There also was a relationship between the evaporation rate and the exterior conditions, which caused condensation on the interior of the large window exposure surrounding the pool.

The study also found that there was a large leak in the pool underneath the surge tank, caused by the corrosion of the cast iron drain pipe that was 30+ times more than the evaporation rate. This was confirmed by sampling for chlorine in wet, swampy area directly downhill from the Recreation Center, which was wet because of the 25,000 gallons per day pool leak. Pool filling procedures were also modified to cut the heating energy use by 1/2 in the spring when the pools were drained, cleaned and refilled.

Hi Rohini,

 

Here are some quick and dirty formulas:

 


Unoccupied Pool Evaporation

 

 

 


E0 = ( ( Ap * (95 + 0.425v) ) / ifg ) * (Pw - Pa)      

Source: ASHRAE 1989 HVAC Chap 20 Eq 1


 

					

Occupied Pool Evaporation

	Source: Shah, HPAC, Mar 04


If (A/N) is greater than 500, then:

	E = E0 * (160 * N / A + 1)

	

If (A/N) is between 50 and 500, then:

	E = E0 * (62.9 * N / A + 1.2)


If (A/N) is less than 50, then:

	E = E0 * 2.5

	

 

					

A = Surface area of pool, ft2

				

N = Number of pool occupants

			

E0 = Rate of evaporation from unoccupied pool, lb/hr

		

E = Rate of evaporation at actual occupancy, lb/hr

		

ifg = Latent heat of vaporization of water, Btu/lb

			

p = Partial pressure of water in air, in. Hg. 

			

?p = (pw ? pr), in. Hg.

				

v = Velocity of air parallel to water surface, feet per minute

		

Pa = Saturation pressure at room temperature and humidity

		

Pw = Saturation pressure at water-surface temperature

 

 

 

 

I agree with Jeff about usage and leaks.  Some other sources of use that are significant:

1. Showers, of course, will be the largest user, up to 60% of all heated water

2. backwash, 4%

3. pool refill ? in the pools I was working at, whirlpool and teach pool (young kids) refills were quite frequent, as often as 1-2x per week, the main pool typically once per year, 11-12% 

4. cleaning, 3%

Evaporation roughly 20%.

This was for pools built in the 70?s-90?s.

BLDG-SIMMERS


We've got another BSUG remote webinar available from the University of Idaho Integrated Design Lab on Wednesday, June 11th.  We will be featuring a Boise-Idaho based start up and an app they developed for doing retrofit lighting simulation and analysis.  Very excited to feature a local company for this month's presentation!  Please see below for more details and direct any questions to kleichliter at uidaho.edu.  Thanks!


Title:  Retrolux - A New Boise-Based Company and Simulation Tool for Lighting Retrofits


Target Audience: Engineers and Architects (CEUs AVAILABLE!) -

Date and Time: June 11th, 2014 - 12.00 to 13.00 MT?

Remote Webinar Available: Register here for the remote webinar - https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/2956792734633392129


Description:

BSUG on June 11th will feature a new software program developed by a local startup company, Retrolux, aimed at streamlining electrical lighting retrofit analysis via a custom app.  The presentation will focus on the role of technology and simulations, commercial lighting as the low-hanging fruit of efficiency measures, the current state of the lighting industry and simulation, and simulations and sustainability.  The new tool hopes to reduce product takeoff and installation costs by over 30%, streamline utility rebate programs, integrate with existing business systems, and provide a centralized project information database that can be updated with future improvements. There will be a short demonstration of the tool at the end of the presentation.


More on Retrolux as a company:

Retrolux is a startup enterprise software as a service (SaaS) software company that seeks to provide energy auditors, electrical contractors, distributors, and utilities with the most comprehensive and integrated product supply chain logistics and energy efficiency software. The initial focus will be lighting products but the long term vision includes the entire electrical product lines and eventually mechanical products as well.  Simply, Retrolux is a mobile-based data collection and product management software that will centralize all business functions required to specify and install building lighting solutions.

I have modeled chilled beams and conventional VAV systems for an office

beams.

Has anyone done similar comparison? I would like to confirm if such energy

The ASHRAE Journal has at least two detailed articles in the past ~6 months comparing these.  The first was by Steve Taylor and included many considerations for controls and design differences.  The second was a case study of a large building somewhere in Asia (I think).
Sorry I can?t give specific references ? I?m about to depart for the day.

Hi all,

I have modeled chilled beams and conventional VAV systems for an office building. I am getting 28% lower annual energy consumption with chilled beams.

Has anyone done similar comparison? I would like to confirm if such energy savings are achievable with chilled beams??

Thanks and Regards,

Actually, the case study building was built by InfoSys in India and used one system for half of the large building and another for the other half.

28% reduction sounds like a big difference if you are referring to total energy use of the building.

Can you go back to your two cases and show each end-use to verify where the savings is occurring?

Dear colleagues:

As in previous years, we will be offering a three day Executive Education Program on Daylighting Buildings<http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/programs/daylighting-buildings-2> at Harvard from July 9-11, 2014.

Course participants will be exposed to a range of design analysis techniques ranging from rules-of-thumb to computer simulations and high dynamic range photography for glare analysis. The main simulation program used will be DIVA<http://diva4rhino.com/>, a Rhino plug-in for Radiance/Daysim and EnergyPlus. The first two days will consist of formal instructions, in-class discussions, hands-on software tutorials, and exercises. Participants will also be given the opportunity to calibrate their personal digital cameras to take physically based high dynamic range photographs of their favorite spaces. During the last day, participants will be given the opportunity to apply the newly acquired analysis techniques to ongoing projects of their own.

I am looking forward to seeing some of you in Cambridge. Best,

Christoph

Sanket,

Your energy savings is based on a lot of factors.

?         You might see significant reheat reduction if you?re moving less total air.

?         You?ll see a fan power savings by moving less air, but be cautious on pressure drop due to reduced AHU size and duct size, which can eat into the fan power savings. A VAV system sized for 450 fpm in the AHU operating most hours between 250-350 fpm may use less energy than a CAV system serving chilled beams where the velocity is 450 fpm all the time even if half as much air is being distributed.

?         There shouldn?t be much cooling savings. A little associated with reduced fan heat due to reduced air flow.

?         If you have a separate chiller that is providing warmer chilled water to the beams you should see some saving there too versus a central chiller that is generating 44F and then blending the water to 58F for the beams.

Here?s a link to the 2012 SimBuild conference paper ?Issues Arising from the Use of Chilled Beams in Energy Models?.

Good luck,

A low energy radiant slab system is one of the strategies in Nrel's 'Strategies
for 50% energy savings in large offices'
<http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/49213.pdf>. Worth a skim through!

Radiant systems such as chilled beams affect Operative temperature more
directly than VAV. The standard unmet hours test is therefore a little
unfair to these kinds of system. Perhaps it is worth the hassle
demonstrating that a comparable level of comfort is achieved during
occupied hours.

Apart from the conditioning of outdoor air latent heat removal is limited
because chilled water temperatures are higher. DOAS tends to deliver air at
a higher temperature as well - typically 15 - 16degC. This is also a
limiting factor in terms of the kind of load that CBs can deal with.

Designers are loath to specify CBs. Reasons include loss of flexibility for
subsequent fit outs, limited loads and limited contractor experience.

Hope this helps

Chris

Francesco,
We have completed a number of projects with www.retroficiency.com<http://www.retroficiency.com>. Their SaaS platform is fast, intuitive, flexible, uses actual weather data for the billing period and their client support is excellent.  They are a relatively new company (~3 years) and constantly improving.  Although USA-based, I think they are worth investigating.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] IGCC for exitting building alteration

Dear All,

I am modeling a building which follow the International Green contraction code public version1.0 (IGCC)  since it is an existing renovation it holds Existing Buildings Chapter 10, section1003 Alterations to existing buildings to energy compliance and shall evaluate accordance section 602.4. Were 602.4.1,602.42 or 602.4.3 as comparing this  602.4.2 Measurement-based compliance with approved agency software from ASHRAE 140. The energy use after the building alteration does not exceed the energy use of the building prior to alteration as measured in consistent units of energy.


?         Since there no modeling procedure in section 602.4.2, we need to model Base case wall, roof, floor, glazing, HVAC system, Lighting & DHW existing(before renovation) &  Proposed case wall, roof, floor, glazing, HVAC system, Lighting & DHW New(after renovation).

?         Comparing energy use of the building prior to alteration to energy use of the building after alteration, result should not exceed energy use of the building prior to alteration.

?         So there is  no standard reference to Baseline & Proposed (like ASHRAE 90.1) ?

Please let me know if there is any standard procedure to do model or my understanding above is right.  Your help will be greatly appreciated .


Regards,
Soham Babu

Hi Francesco,

Canadian RETScreen spreadsheet based tool will do the job perfectly. You can also use it for other purposes as it has several modules. Free of charge, very easy to use, excellent tool and guys from NRCAN did an excellent job. You have various case studies included  to help you better understand the the tool.Please note that this is not a design tool but rather a decision making tool (direct you what technology to pursue). 

It uses heating degree method for energy consumption. There is a detailed methodology in pdf downloadable from the web site.
You can choose location of choice, building fabric( U value) above/below ground, set point temperatures ,zone dimensions, ACH etc. You can select up to 5 zones (if not mistaken)
Enter fuel rate, operation schedule, investment, inflation,  etc.
Compares proposed design vs base design
Outputs are cash flow diagram, investment payback time, energy consumption, GHG analysis
Note. Tool is very sensitive to  heating/cooling changeover temperature value so make a reasonable assumption (it affects length of heating/cooling season).

I was involved in energy efficiency project where existing public buildings  were refurbished ( old windows replaced by  PVC windows dbl glazed  low-e coated, insulation added e.g. added 5 cm of rockwool insulation, ACH reduced etc.). The idea was to understand energy reductions and investment payback time.  Now, big issue was what software should be used for this application as there were many buildings and very tight deadlines. We compared 2 tools. The same building divided into same number of zones , with same parameters  was simulated in TAS and RETscreen. 
Results revealed that difference between the two tools was up to cca. plus/minus 10% (TAS is more accurate but more time consuming to prepare a model than RETSCreen). The choice was to go with RETScreen. 

Hope this help.
The other similar tool is Retscreen`s US counterpart HOMER (but I think it deals only with renewable energy sources+ no free of charge).
Cheers,Sasa Pantic

 I am
 interested in
 software that can be useful for the evaluation of building
 refurbishments, both
 from the technical point of view and from the financial
 point of view. Such a
 software could be used by ESCOs to evaluate what solutions
 are the best ones to
 maximize its profits. The software should consider financial
 parameters both
 among the input data and among the output data. Any
 suggestion, please?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] VRF with humidity control DOAS
Message-ID: <CAPgg=ystqLoH6C-3UfhuCN-oSvu_5Ugf4SbzWyvRQ=m5SYtn=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have modeled VRF system but I am getting high humidity for several hours
in an year so I have implemented DOAS system  with humidity control. I took
reference of "DOASDXCOIL_wADPBFMethod.idf" for adding DOAS to control
humidity.

The humidity problem has not been solved and I am getting same RH values as
before adding DOAS. What can be the problem with the system?

I am getting following warnings:
1) "CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode="OA
COOLING COIL" - Air volume flow rate per watt of rated total cooling
capacity is out of range"
2) "CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode="OA
COOLING COIL" - Full load outlet temperature indicates a possibility of
frost/freeze error continues."

One more interesting thing I have observed is that VRF system is using
double the electricity for cooling for the same building as compared to VAV
system!! VRF system is supposed to be more energy efficient than VAV
system??

Also I have modeled chilled beam system where I am again facing problems of
high humidity. I am planning to use  same type of DOAS as in the example
file mentioned above. Is it a good way or should I refer to other example
file which would be more appropriate?

Kind Regards,
Sanket

*Subject:* [Bldg-sim] VRF with humidity control DOAS



Hi,

I have modeled VRF system but I am getting high humidity for several hours
in an year so I have implemented DOAS system  with humidity control. I took
reference of "DOASDXCOIL_wADPBFMethod.idf" for adding DOAS to control
humidity.

The humidity problem has not been solved and I am getting same RH values as
before adding DOAS. What can be the problem with the system?

I am getting following warnings:
1) "CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode="OA
COOLING COIL" - Air volume flow rate per watt of rated total cooling
capacity is out of range"
2) "CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode="OA
COOLING COIL" - Full load outlet temperature indicates a possibility of
frost/freeze error continues."



One more interesting thing I have observed is that VRF system is using
double the electricity for cooling for the same building as compared to VAV
system!! VRF system is supposed to be more energy efficient than VAV
system??



Also I have modeled chilled beam system where I am again facing problems of
high humidity. I am planning to use  same type of DOAS as in the example
file mentioned above. Is it a good way or should I refer to other example
file which would be more appropriate?

Kind Regards,

Sanket

*Studio Proposition:*



Architecture is often seen as a balanced solution to a host of problems
imposed by aesthetic aspirations, use and program, location and site,
immediate external environment, occupant comfort and regulatory constraints
among other considerations. Although most of these are addressed in design,
the external and internal environmental solutions are often not included,
and rarely fully integrated


This studio, as part of *Built Ecologies* program at CASE
<http://www.case.rpi.edu/> proposes to bring to the forefront a resolution
for environmental sensitivity, both external and internal, whilst addressing
the pressing issues of energy and climate at a global and local scale. The
studio employed ecological thought and design process to study, analyze and
design systems at varying scales that are fully integrated, function in a
harmonized fashion and resolve to a balanced architectural solution.


Three students, Xiaofei Shen, Francesco Bedeschi and Kyle Schillaci will
present their final projects highlighting the environmental analysis and
design process integration using various tools and resultant outcomes.
Varun Kohli, Adjunct Professor at CASE, will introduce the studio.

http://www.eventbrite.com/e/ibpsa-chicago-presents-an-introduction-to-openstudio-the-openstudio-sdk-tickets-11990579145?aff=esli



Title: ?*An Introduction to OpenStudio and the OpenStudio SDK*?

Speakers: *David Goldwasser*, NREL and *Alan Jackson*, CASE



Wednesday, June 25, 2014 from 6:30 PM to 9:00 PM (CDT)
300 W Adams St Chicago, IL



Abstract:

OpenStudio is a building energy modeling application and a software
development kit being developed by the National Renewable Energy Lab.
OpenStudio provides the ability to compute building energy use and
daylighting from a common model.   Through the use of the Parametric
Analysis Tool (PAT) and connections to the Building Component Library
(BCL), OpenStudio provides the ability to systematically generate and
modify building models, with standardized components and measures, through
a GUI interface, scripting languages, or both.  David Goldwasser (NREL)
will give an overview of the OpenStudio ecosystem and how it is being used
by various organizations. He will demonstrate a typical modeling workflow
using OpenStudio?s applications. The demonstration will highlight some of
the new features in the soon to be release 1.4.0 version of  OpenStudio.
Alan Jackson (CASE) will discuss how the OpenStudio SDK and API can be used
to create new tools or  to create extensions to existing design tools. Alan
and David will lead a discussion about what is required to support a real
world iterative design process. What?s possible today and what can be
improved in OpenStudio and in third party tools to improve the process?

*Studio Proposition:*



Architecture is often seen as a balanced solution to a host of problems
imposed by aesthetic aspirations, use and program, location and site,
immediate external environment, occupant comfort and regulatory constraints
among other considerations. Although most of these are addressed in design,
the external and internal environmental solutions are often not included,
and rarely fully integrated


 This studio, as part of *Built Ecologies* program at CASE
<http://www.case.rpi.edu/> proposes to bring to the forefront a resolution
for environmental sensitivity, both external and internal, whilst addressing
the pressing issues of energy and climate at a global and local scale. The
studio employed ecological thought and design process to study, analyze and
design systems at varying scales that are fully integrated, function in a
harmonized fashion and resolve to a balanced architectural solution.


Three students, Xiaofei Shen, Francesco Bedeschi and Kyle Schillaci will
present their final projects highlighting the environmental analysis and
design process integration using various tools and resultant outcomes.
Varun Kohli, Adjunct Professor at CASE, will introduce the studio.

Hi;  Energy 10 software package was deveolped by the Sustainable 
Buildings Industry Council  SBIC;
they had  a small office in NW Washington DC  USA. Versions increased in 
rev number from  1.4 to 1.5 to 1.6
then jump to  v 1.8.  V 1.8 had solar thermal modeling added, and 
although I used energy 10 quite a bit I never
got  Energy 10 solar thermal to work.  I particularly liked the day of 
the year spectrum feature.

The heat transfer through floors was the subject of an extensive 
exchange on the old YAHOO solar energy group
E-mail list about  6 to 8 years ago.  I think you can find the basement 
floor  f  factor there.

SBIC and its website SBIC.org were  absorbed by   Winter Associates 
years go.  I may have the E-10 v 1.8 CD.

bye

Subject: [Bldg-sim] MIT's Climate CoLab is Crowdsourcing Solutions to
	Climate Change
Message-ID: <CAEXphRqANXwKjvZJ=w9_nSNf0wxwG1V98DczQtxGA94fe4mZ3g@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings folks,

MIT?s Climate CoLab (based at MIT's Center for Collective Intelligence) is
developing ideas to solve climate change through crowdsourcing ideas on its
web platform (see it here <http://climatecolab.org/>).

If you submit one of the winning ideas, you will be able to present it
before government officials, business executives, NGO leaders and
scientists who can help move proposals toward implementation, as well as
share it at an MIT conference, where a $10,000 Grand Prize will be awarded.

Even if you don?t have new ideas yourself, you can help improve other
people?s ideas, support the ones you find most promising, or participate in
the social network prize (link here
<http://climatecolab.org/socialnetworkprize/-/link/3477ae3e-e24d-49c8-8e29-d1d07fec2771>
).

Current contests address energy supply, carbon pricing, building
efficiency, adaptation, geoengineering, shifting public attitudes and
behaviors, and over a dozen other topics. Those who are interested in
building energy data solutions and in the ancillary benefits of building
energy efficiency are especially invited to contribute to this contest
<http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/1300203>.

*Entries are due** July 20, 2014**.*

Other questions? Contact us at colab_buildings_contest_2014 at googlegroups.com

Thanks,

AJ

Subject: [Bldg-sim] CXL - ComCheck XML Schema
Message-ID: <CAGUszWFKns1M2MAL6wdZA5zy-Ug+ddyZqROS7un5Y57yee+BBw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Does anybody know where the ComCheck XML schema is? According to the saved
.cxl files, it should be located here:
http://energycode.pnl.gov/ns/ComCheckBuildingSchema

There are two file formats to save ComCheck files in - a binary and an XML
file. The XML file is plain text and can be generated by anybody who knows
the format of the file.

I'd like to create some scripts that output ComCheck compatible files, and
if the schema is available, I wouldn't have to reverse engineer it.

Thanks,

DS

Message-ID: <70A788B2F4CB7247BE72AA7FCB60BD889CC1EBDF@ENGR2K10NODE1.engr.psu.edu>

The mission of the Penn State Consortium for Building Energy Innovation (CBEI) at the Philadelphia Navy Yard is to transform the energy efficiency market for existing small- and medium-sized commercial buildings (SMSCBs). The CBEI seeks to be recognized as the leader in creating vibrant ecosystems to identify and apply integrative technologies and innovative practices in existing buildings. To support this mission, the CBEI seeks an experienced Data Analyst / Building Energy Modeler for the current portfolio of projects.
The candidate will participate in analysis of energy use in target buildings and will participate in selection and evaluation of Energy Efficiency Measures (EEMs) in SMSCBs. Experience designing and installing energy retrofit projects in buildings is a plus. Candidates should have experience conducting energy audits of SMSCBs, reviewing building drawings (CAD, Revit, PDF format), understanding the building systems, and screening through the building automation system (BAS) to understand roughly how the building systems are controlled/operated. Candidates will participate in the design and specification of Measurement and Verification (M&V) systems for retrofit projects, and will calculate the observed energy savings based on the available data using IPMVP and/or ASHRAE Guideline 14 compliant methods.
Successful candidates must be experienced creating Energy Plus (E+) building energy models, using Open Studio, DesignBuilder and/or other E+ related tools. The successful candidate should have demonstrated experience calibrating E+ energy models using available utility bills, sub-metering and/or end-use loads, short-term monitoring data, field observations, etc., and will use the calibrated models to evaluate energy conservation measures (EEMs) in buildings.
The candidate should be proficient with analysis of time-series of building energy/operational data (including development of energy use load shapes) using Excel, Minitab, Matlab, R and similar available tools; should be able to benchmark a building energy use with EnergyStar Portfolio Manager or similar tools, and will analyze and validate benchmarking, utility bills, sub-metering, M&V and other building energy data sets in support of CBEI research and projects. The candidate will conceive and co-author case-studies, articles and scholarly publications to communicate CBEI work to the market, along with colleagues.
Candidate should possess a BS degree in an Engineering field (MS preferred), and have at least three years' experience creating E+ models. Relevant credentials such as E.I.T. or P.E., BEMP, BEAP, LEED AP, and CEM are strongly desired. The primary work site will be at the CBEI offices at the Navy Yard in Philadelphia. Applications will be accepted until the position is filled.

 & Independent Daylight Visualization
Message-ID: <1355640477.307771.1403791114978.open-xchange@app01.ox.hosteurope.de>

Hi friends,

I've recently released a new version of the Mr.Comfy E+ output spatial
visualization / analysis tool for Rhino5/GH3D and invite you to give it a spin;
a new feature that may be useful to the community here is the possibility to
create your own thermal report variable(s) from user input expressions:
http://mrcomfy.org/?p=866 (blog post); http://mrcomfy.org/?page_id=789
(documentation).

Besides custom expressions, the Daysim visualization component is now more
easily usable - independent of E+ data presence - and thermal display works a
lot faster than in previous versions.

Any input, comments & case studies are welcome; if you have visualizations
created with the tool and would like to share them on the site, I'd love to put
them out there. The latest case study of my own can be found in the blog:
http://mrcomfy.org/?p=857 .

Enjoy & all the best,

Max

Hi,

Thanks Clayton!

I just wanted to add that building enough reputation on another Stack
Exchange site only takes a couple of hours.

There are 124 Stack Exchange sites, ranging from science to art to home
improvement, gardening, etc. You can see the full list here: http://
stackexchange.com/sites. I am sure one will fit you.

Building your reputation to 200 is really easy. Each vote on a question you
post or an answer you provide bumps you up 10 points. You usually get 3 or
4 votes each time, ans some questions are really basic.
I initially joined Stackoverflow, the programming site. In about 2-3 hours
of time, spread over a week, I had reached the 200 reputation threshold.
And along the way I had helped people that needed it. It's a win-win
situation!

This kind of Q&A platform will be extremely useful for our community, so
please consider helping!

Best,
Julien
