Subject: [BLDG-SIM] EP-Quick Version 1.0 Now Available
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200504181306.AA0600859pd80000641055@gard.com>

One of the first EnergyPlus interfaces, EP-Quick, is now available.
You can use EP-Quick to create input files for many different
buildings using built in templates for the shape and zone layout. By
using templates for commonly shaped buildings and zone layouts, the
time needed to create an EnergyPlus input file is greatly reduced and
it works for any sized building. See the following web site for more
information:

  http://www.glazersoftware.com/ep-quick.htm

Please download EP-Quick and give it a try. The version you download
acts as a demo and only generates EnergyPlus input files for
triangular buildings. Once purchased and registered, EP-Quick can
generate EnergyPlus input files based on 26 different templates. 
Please see the web site for additional information including screen
shots and images of each template.

EnergyPlus must be downloaded separately from:

  http://www.energyplus.gov/

EP-Quick costs $89 for a single user license and $39 for an academic license.  

I'm sending this message to the BLDG-SIM mailing list, the
EnergyPlus_Support at yahoo.com mailing list, and others so I apologize
if you receive more than one copy.

Thanks,

In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200504181220.AA2044140pd80000675334@gard.com>

Hi Greenies,

I assume LEED will not give an ID credit for an installation of either a 
solar electric or a solar thermal system, since solar thermal will count 
towards EAc1.1 and there already is a renewable energy credit.

In our case, the PV system will not generate the required 5% thus the 
project will get no credit for it. Our project is using both solar thermal 
and PV.

Does anyone know of any specific projects where the USGBC gave the project 
an ID credit for using either. 

Many Thanks!!!!

Several of my students have been doing some work in this area (i.e.,
surface temperature measurements and thermal imaging of PVs on different
rooftop applications). I forwarded your email and they will be in direct

Hi,

 

I am looking for research on the thermal impact of Building Integrated
PVs (BIPV). Any experimental and or simulation data of PV roof
integrations and their impact on the energy flow through the building
envelope. Has there been any comparison between the BIPVs and regular
building component heat flows, including factors such as the insulation
level, the reflectance, thermal properties of the PVs as a layer and any
shading.

 

Thanks,

My building is located at the campus of the University
of Jaen, Spain. Its use is for researching and
educational. We?re trying to control the systems:
Reversible cycle air to water heat pumps, air handler
units and fan-coils.

Brian-

I can't answer #1 or #3 but would be very interested in any responses.

Question #2:  Whenever we have this situation, we set up an independent HRV
unit with a dummy zone and run all OA for the WSHPs through the HRV.  The
HRV unit would have 100% OA with heat recovery and VAV.

Hope this helps.  Have a nice weekend.

Model the system as a VAV system with preheat.  Use return fans instead of 
exhaust fans.  As the system is 100% OA the return fans act as exhaust 
fans.  Set a MIN-AIR-SACH and MIN-CFM-RATIO schedules in the system to 
specify the hours when the fans run at 40%.  Use VSDs on the fans in the 
building and in the model.  This type of system has been used successfully 
at the new BC Cancer Centre for thier lab systems.  Where possible, use 
transfer air from non-lab systems to provide some of the make-up air for 
the labs - this will save considerable energy over 100% outdoor air.

You have no option, the fume hoods have to run 24/7/365. In 1981 
University of Maryland College Park -- Chemistry Department had two grad 
students recrystalize an organic compound
using  warmed 100% N-Octane as the solvent. They wanted to speed things 
up so they
put the beaker in a regular refrigerator ......... The blast wiped out 
three lab rooms on the
4th floor. The frig did not have a sealed explosion proof defroster fan 
motor..........
The classrooms were empty and the two RAs got the munchies and went  the 
basement
vending machines for a candy bar, still the sight of their lab coats 
riddled with glass cuts.....

You can make the fume hoods a separate heating zone, supply them 
directly with heat exchanger
tempered outside air, and use two fan speeds occupied and vacant- hoods 
closed

Yes, this does cause condensation which shows up as a "warning" in eQuest.
Brian Fountain found the bug though. See below for those eQuest users who
think the default values should be normal design practice. Now there is a
reduction in cooling and in heating with the control by MAT which saves a
significant amount of energy, and in talking to the mechanical design
engineer for this project, this is actually how it will be controlled, and
is typical design practice.
___________________________________________________________________________

Check your heat recovery control -- I believe default is to float the
temperature which means you are recovering year round and adding to the
cooling load.  If you change this to follow mixed air temperature you should
have a better sim.

Hope this helps.

is a 100% outside air constant volume system (a base case) for a multi-zone

Peter S,
The only thing I would add to what has been said is stating the obvious, that fume hood exhaust diversifies across a building and through the day so a single system OA schedule is likely sufficient rather than attempting something zone by zone.  Where we had a case of VAV fume hoods, we assumed an average use (50%) and then ran sensitivity studies to bound the likely performance ...  At the time this worked for us.
Regards,
Graham

  Peter,

  I don't have VisualDOE, but in eQuest at the zone level you can set a min. flow schedule. You could use this to emulate the 2-position flow you desire. During the day the min. flow would be 1 (full design) and at night it would be 0.4. The SA flow rate should only go higher than the min. flow if the load requires it, doubtful for the labs under either condition. If memory serves me those commands are also available in 2.1E. With this and a VFD fan you can simulate variable position hoods and even cover a mix of CAV and VAV labs.

  Firstly I am using VisualDoe, I am modeling the energy performance of a 200,000 sf building which has 60,000 sf of laboratories.

Now I have the following problem: a fan system is either on or off, therefore the lab fans are on 24 hours a day. I would like to reduce the exhaust flow during unoccupied periods to exhaust air from the fume hoods at their minimum flow of 40%. Reducing the flow would also reduce the make up of outside air to balance the flow and obviously reduce energy consumption.

I think the 'right' way to do this is to assign your exhaust fans to a
schedule.  You may even be able to assign the fan to an appropriate VFD
load curve.  Of course, you've probably already found that VDOE doesn't
have a nice wrapper to do this, so direct editing of the input file (.iXX
for VDOE I think) would be required.  Hopefully the gurus on the list come
up with an easy way to do this.

A 'close enough' solution could be to model the laboratory exhaust as a
return fan in the laboratory system.  Then manipulate the laboratory
system's OA schedule as appropriate to accurately model the exhaust flows.
This should also allow modeling the return/exhaust fan as a VFD fan,
dependent on the type of system you use.  In some situations (such as an
induction-diffuser or chilled beam cooled space), you will have to assess
the impact of modeling phantom recirculation airflow.  Note that in
VisualDOE the OA schedule is defined in the HVAC Systems Editor, not the
Room occupancy schedule.

The return fan approach is not as satisfying as just inputting exhaust
fans using the Zone-Exhaust fan option, but can be flexible enough to work
for many lab configurations.  It breaks down if your laboratory system
already has a return fan, for example a combined office/lab system (which
can sometimes offer some slick indirect cascade ventilation).  This
approach would probably require (at least) a bit of fidgeting and 'reality
checking' of a few hourly outputs, OA ratio and system flow in particular,
to reach a satisfactory model.

Hopefully I haven't missed the mark too much - its Friday for me too!

Good luck,

John Weale

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Variable flow laboratory exhaust systems.
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200504081131.AA3119156pd80000628640@gard.com>

OK , its Friday so I am allowed to ask for advice and guidance.

Firstly I am using VisualDoe, I am modeling the energy performance of a
200,000 sf building which has 60,000 sf of laboratories. The labs all
have fume hoods so the supply air is balanced to the exhaust air (100%
OA).. Now I have the following problem: a fan system is either on or
off, therefore the lab fans are on 24 hours a day. I would like to
reduce the exhaust flow during unoccupied periods to exhaust air from
the fume hoods at their minimum flow of 40%. Reducing the flow would
also reduce the make up of outside air to balance the flow and obviously
reduce energy consumption.

Am I missing something here or does anyone have a magic trick that will
allow me to accomplish my goal. Simply said HELP

Dear Rohini,

 

I am currently writing two papers, one for the IBPSA conference in Montreal
in August of this year. The other is a progression of the work presented in
the aforementioned paper and I hope to publish it in "Energy in Buildings"
in the coming months. Both papers outline a method of utilising EnergyPlus
(or any simulation tool for that matter) for effective design through each
phase of the building life cycle. 

 

 A published paper that may be of interest to you is: 

 

Mourshed, MM, Kelliher, D, Keane, M (2003)
<http://www.ibpsa.org/IBPSANews-13-1r.pdf> Integrating simulation in design.
IBPSA News. Vol 13 No. 1. pp. 21-16.

I'm not sure if that paper addresses actual % savings. If you find further
papers that do capture percentages, I would be very interested. 

 

Kind regards

 

-Elmer

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] energy savings due to use of simulation tool

 

I was wondering if anyone has information or is aware of any paper(s) that
talk about the % energy savings realized because they used a energy
simulation tool (for a real building). Also I noticed that energyplus
download page asks for similar information. Has that data been published, or
is it possible to get some information out of it.

 

As always, any pointers/answers are appreciated.

FYI:

The best information I know about for designing a rock bed storage is in
the old Solaron Manual (i.e., George Lof's old company out of Denver),
which includes design information and construction details. Also, FCHART
will do an analysis of an active air system if you know the parameters
for the pebble-bed storage. These are not simple to design, since there
is a bit of screening involved, and air flow through passages under
1,000s of lbs of rock. Solaron had this down to a science in their
installation manual. If you can't find a copy let me know.

I live in a passive (and active) solar home with rock bed storage in my
sunroom in Golden, Colorado. We did not design this house ourselves....
There is about 4 feet of rocks underneath wooden boards with about 1/2" of
space between the boards and the rocks start about 1 foot below the boards.
There is also brick on both walls. It gets really hot in this room in the
winter (and in the summer since it was not designed with proper overhangs so
we need to add some exterior overhangs as well). There used to be a duct and
fan to blow heat to the floor above, but it was removed by the previous
owners probably due to aesthetics since it was right in the middle of the
sunroom. Due to the airspace, there are a lot of bugs and dust that collect
on the rock bed. Frankly, I think the sunspace itself is quite sufficient
with the brick and glazing alone, and due to indoor air quality concerns, we
will likely take out the rock bed or seal it up. So if you do this rock bed,
make sure it is well sealed so bugs and dust cannot collect on it,
especially if you are going to blow air through it. And if it is already
going to be located in a sun room, it may not be necessary if you have brick
or another high mass feature in the space. It sounds like yours is going
over tile. You'd have to design it to make sure the rocks below the tile
heat up.

Lee,
I tend to agree with many of Steve's observations.  When I was at Berkeley
we visited the Village Homes site in Davis, California.  While this is a
more temperate climate, the feedback we got at the time was that the houses
performed quite well but the fan coupled rock stores in most cases were
providing very marginal benefit in winter as the houses already had a number
of other passive features.  If my memory servese me correctly, the controls
were two complicated for the simple home owner to manage to get the most out
of the system.  The summer benefits were likely greater.  I believe there is
some case study material on the Vital Signs website.  Cris Benton at
Berekeley I believe still runs the Vital Signs program if you can't find the
website.  A web search on Village Homes will turn up additional background
information.

Graham

Subject: [bldg-sim] Modeling curtainwall spandrel cavities - ENERGY10 (and others)
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200504060918.AA1812812pd80000625138@gard.com>

Hello all,

I'm working on my Ph.D. at the University of Toronto.  I'm a specialist in building science and my research is focusing on curtain walls.

My goal is to model a curtain wall spandrel cavity in order to obtain such info such as (i) cavity air temps (ii) material surface temps (iii) temperature lags (thermal mass) (iv) day gain versus night loss , etc.  Currently, I'm using ENERGY10 with some success.  Since this program generally focuses on whole buildings, I'm inputting my cavity as a very small 'whole' building.  I think ENERGY10 will limit me to general trends and not be able to give and specifics further down the road.

My question...can anyone suggest some other programs to model such a cavity.  

Thanks,

Hello Lee,

If this is just a modelling exercise then ESP-r (3d finite
difference) would be a good choice. Its linux based, free and a the European
reference research tool but its not for the uninitiated. See
http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Programs/ESP-r.htm
CANMET are developing there new Hot3000
program using it as the core engine.

But if you are looking for low energy /no heating buildings the
Passive House approach would probably be more economical and less
difficult to regulate. Triple glazing, high insulation, earth to air
heat exchange (preheat) with HRV, no thermal bridges see
http://www.passivehouse.com/English/PassiveH.HTM
http://passiv.de/07_eng/news/CEPHEUS_ECEEE.pdf  post evaluation report
http://www.cepheus.de/eng/index.html
There have been a number of office buildings constructed using this
approach as well.
The PHI have a very detailed steady state MSExell workbook for doing
the calculations (in German). I have done a rough english translation.


PS Bion Howard developed The CMU Air-Core Passive Hybrid Heat Storage System
 using concrete blocks that is a bit simpler than rock bed but quite effective.

Lee,
I tend to agree with many of Steve's observations.  When I was at Berkeley
we visited the Village Homes site in Davis, California.  While this is a
more temperate climate, the feedback we got at the time was that the houses
performed quite well but the fan coupled rock stores in most cases were
providing very marginal benefit in winter as the houses already had a number
of other passive features.  If my memory servese me correctly, the controls
were two complicated for the simple home owner to manage to get the most out
of the system.  The summer benefits were likely greater.  I believe there is
some case study material on the Vital Signs website.  Cris Benton at
Berekeley I believe still runs the Vital Signs program if you can't find the
website.  A web search on Village Homes will turn up additional background
information.
Regards,
Graham

Pedro,
If the low speed mode is for night cooling only (i.e. full speed during
occupied hours), then you should be able to use the night cycling keywords
(see NIGHT-CYCLE-CTRL).  I haven't applied these to a constant volume system
such as SZRH, but I believe these will allow you to simulate your problem.
I would suggest looking carefully at hourly reports to make sure the night
purge is working as you envisaged as overcooling can easily lead to an
unwanted heating load; you can play with seasonal heating setpoints to
overcome some of this ...
Regards,
Graham

welcome) comments below. If this discussion is best carried out offline, 
please advise me.

Cost is not the only driver for this design. We are attempting to make 
this building as "green" as possible. Thus electrical energy (to drive a 
fan) from photovoltaics is more desirable than non-renewable energy 
(e.g. natural gas for a forced air heater). The main purpose of the rock 
floor is to help provide enough thermal mass to buffer the expected 
large thermal swings that occur with about 12% of the floorspace in 
south facing glazing. This (large temperature swings) seems to me the 
biggest potential problem with the design. I've seen estimates of indoor 
temperature in south facing rooms as high as 85 degrees at the ceiling, 
in winter. My experience (in Southern California) suggests that such 
temperatures are very likely and may even be an underestimate. In the 
morning, I wouldn't be surprised to find a 20 degree temperature 
differential between the cold rocks and heated air.

I suspect that the most relevant calculation would be to estimate the 
net amount of radiant energy gain for the building in winter. By 
covering the windows at night and uncovering them during the day, I 
would hope that the energy gain would be nearly enough to heat the 
house. Perhaps this should be the focus of a modeling effort. The role 
of the rock floor would be to buffer the temperature swings entirely 
through heat exchange by conduction. This *could* be modeled by simply 
reducing the amplitude of the temperature variations.

Also, the rock floor should be thought of as a simple addition to a 
crawl space, i.e. we are dumping some rocks into an otherwise empty 
insulated (from the ground) space. This will cost more like $5000 extra, 
not $20,000 extra. (This is a guess on my part.)

I'm not familiar with the terms "charge" and "discharge", but we are 
imagining a fan that is triggered by a certain (say 5 degree) 
temperature differential between rocks and ceiling and remains on until 
that differential is less than the selected difference. I don't see why 
this requires a fan that is twice as powerful.

As I mentioned above, it seems to me that the savings on the heating 
bill depend most strongly on the net radiation absorbed inside the 
building. The rock floor may help to limit heat loss by lowering the 
temperature extremes, but I would think this is a secondary affect if 
the windows are covered at night. If there are no sunny days, there can 
be no savings.

My understanding is that well sealed houses tend to have the opposite 
problem: too much moisture is trapped inside. While it's true that the 
climate is dry, we plan to use a heat exchanger/ventilation system to 
control humidity.

Mold is often cited as a reason not to use rock beds, but the dry 
climate may really help here.

True. Also the sunlit rooms will be unusable for things like watching 
television and using a computer. Being green is not easy.

Hi all:
My building has a constant volume AHU with a two speed
fan, and I'm thinking in using the low speed for night
and the high speed for day. I'm not sure how to model
it in eQuest.
I've realised that the FAN-CONTROL command has an

Do you have any suggestions to model this system?
Thanks in advance,

Lee,

OK, the rockbed is being charged with warm air from inside the house; not
from a solar air heater which could produce air at a considerably warmer
temperature.  If the maximum space temperature you are comfortable with is
80F, and the rock bed must be heated to at least 75F to later produce 70F in
the space, then we are talking about a 5F MAXIMUM temperature differential
between the rock bed and the space.

While I make my living by writing energy simulation software (DOE-2), I
believe there are many times when a full-blown computer simulation is not
justified.  So, before getting bogged down in trying to model a rockbed
system in a detailed energy simulation program, it might be useful to first
look at some rough numbers, and make a decision as to whether the rough
numbers justify a more detailed analysis.  

So, for what it is worth, here is my 15 minutes of thinking:

To move 1000 cfm at 1" static will require about 0.25 kW of fan energy. But
the air has to first be used to charge the rockbed, and then again to
discharge it.  So double the fan energy to 0.5 kW/1000cfm of heated air
delivered to the space.  At $0.10/kWh, this amounts to $0.05/1000cfm per
hour.

The amount of heat that can be delivered per 1000 cfm is:  1.08 * 1000cfm *
5dT = 5400 Btuh.  Adding in the fan heat, the net heating effect is 5770
Btuh.  At an equivalent 80% furnace efficiency and $1.00 per therm of
natural gas, the gross savings in natural gas are $0.072/1000cfm of heated
air delivered to the space.  Assuming the system can provide 100% of the
annual heating loads, the savings on the heating bill are 1 - 0.05/0.072 =
~30%

The location described gets a lot of winter sun, which even in a
conventional design will act to significantly reduce heating loads.  What
would the house cost to heat if intelligently designed (well insulated,
reasonable south glass, some thermal mass), but without the rockbed? $1500
per year?  What does the rockbed cost, $20,000?  Does a potential ~$500 per
year savings justify the cost of the rockbed?  

Of course, these numbers are very approximate, and the actual savings may
vary due to a variety of factors:
1)  If natural gas is not available, then the system may be more attractive.
2)  The 5F delta T may be too large.  80F space temperature in a cold, dry,
5000 ft desert climate may result in extremely low humidity in the space.
This may tend to desiccate the occupant's skin and sinuses, and they may not
find it comfortable.  
3)  Many hours, the fan will be charging the rockbed with the house being
cooler than 80F.  So effectiveness during those hours is reduced. 
4)  Rockbeds tend to be dusty, and may become moldy.  You may need to use a
high efficiency filter, which may raise the required fan static to do the
job.
5)  This quickie analysis assumes that the solar system can provide 100% of
the annual heating; some auxiliary heat will almost certainly be required.
6)  All losses from the rockbed to the ground are neglected.
7)  The bright sun will act to fade the furniture more rapidly than in a
conventional house.  What is impact on the furniture replacement budget?
The sun may also degrade the finish on cabinetry more rapidly, especially if
varnished.  Deduct maintenance costs from the energy savings.

For many experienced people using this listing, the above may come across as
too preachy.  To those people, I apologize.  But I understand that a lot of
graduate students also subscribe to this listing, and I want to emphasize
that considering too many details when first approaching a problem can get
in the way of the answer.  It is often useful to first look at the forest
before focusing on the trees........

Lee, I would be interested in knowing what your ultimate conclusions are.

Steve

First, let me say that I've been a bit overwhelmed with the quality (and 
quantity) of responses. I appreciate all the discourse and am struggling 
to check out all the suggestions.

It is a good idea for me to address some of the issues I described 
originally. "ICF" stands for insulated concrete forms which consist of a 
foam form (about 2" thick) into which concrete (9-12" thick) is poured. 
These will be used for exterior walls for the single story structure. 
Although the insulating (sound and heat) properties are great, and the 
costs are reasonable, there is little heat storage by the concrete 
because of the interior foam.

Some details on the rock floor. It will be a layer of 2" rocks, about 4 
feet deep. There will be insulation underneath and a concrete and tile 
floor above. Part (about 1/3) of the tile floor will be in direct sun 
when conditions allow. There will be a couple of plenums (consisting of 
stacked concrete blocks with spacers near the bottom) running the length 
of the rock floor and there will be an air barrier of some sort that 
will channel warm air from the plenum to the outer portion of the rock 
floor. Other plenums near the ceiling will allow warm air to be forced 
(with fans) down to the rock floor where it will circulate back into the 
house through floor registers (after having given up heat to the rocks). 
This rock floor will be used over the entire structure (about 3500 sq 
ft). The builder/designer says that he's used this approach and it works 
pretty well. There is sufficient heat transferred to the rocks to make 
them a reasonable thermal mass. This system also redistributes air from 
the warm (south/high) side of the structure to the cold (north/low) side.

I realize that this type of thermal mass may be difficult to model in 
detail and that it is important to look at the energy cost of the fan(s) 
in all of this.

I hope this description helps.

Lee Elson

First, let me say that I've been a bit overwhelmed with the quality (and 
quantity) of responses. I appreciate all the discourse and am struggling 
to check out all the suggestions.

It is a good idea for me to address some of the issues I described 
originally. "ICF" stands for insulated concrete forms which consist of a 
foam form (about 2" thick) into which concrete (9-12" thick) is poured. 
These will be used for exterior walls for the single story structure. 
Although the insulating (sound and heat) properties are great, and the 
costs are reasonable, there is little heat storage by the concrete 
because of the interior foam.

Some details on the rock floor. It will be a layer of 2" rocks, about 4 
feet deep. There will be insulation underneath and a concrete and tile 
floor above. Part (about 1/3) of the tile floor will be in direct sun 
when conditions allow. There will be a couple of plenums (consisting of 
stacked concrete blocks with spacers near the bottom) running the length 
of the rock floor and there will be an air barrier of some sort that 
will channel warm air from the plenum to the outer portion of the rock 
floor. Other plenums near the ceiling will allow warm air to be forced 
(with fans) down to the rock floor where it will circulate back into the 
house through floor registers (after having given up heat to the rocks). 
This rock floor will be used over the entire structure (about 3500 sq 
ft). The builder/designer says that he's used this approach and it works 
pretty well. There is sufficient heat transfered to the rocks to make 
them a reasonable thermal mass. This system also redistributes air from 
the warm (south/high) side of the structure to the cold (north/low) side.

I realize that this type of thermal mass may be difficult to model in 
detail and that it is important to look at the energy cost of the fan(s) 
in all of this.

I hope this description helps.

Lee Elson

Hello:

Actually, DOE-2 can do good job with thermal mass if one has custom
weighting factors and "effective" values for the internal
convection/radiation coefficient, and contact area. In a calibrated
CFD/DOE-3 simulation of a Buddhist temple in Thailand we got
remarkably-good results. 

See: Sreshthaputra, A., Haberl, J., Andrews, M. 2004. "Improving
Building Design and Operation of a Thai Buddhist Temple", Energy and
Buildings, Vol. 36,  pp. 481-494, for more details.

Unfortunately, this requires more time and resources than your average
human being will allow, and DOE-2 is still limited in its ground
coupling, unless you are using the latest instructions from Huang et
al., and you already have existing soil properties and ground
temperatures.

The biggest mistake that I see most people making with DOE-2 is using
quick calculations (i.e., entering a floor weight, and not using custom
weighting factors). In general quick calculat6ions lead to some very
strange interior temperatures.

Lee,

Doe2 (2.1 or 2.2) is not the right program for looking at heavy thermal
mass
buildings.  The limitation is a function of the thermal response factors
used to represent time-delayed heat transfer through opaque surfaces.
This
method is a legacy of the original DOE2 design requirements which were
somewhat hindered by slow computers.

You should use a simulation program that uses a more fundamental heat
balance approach.  There are several but I believe that ESP-r (ESRU,
University of Strathclyde) is one of the best.

I'm designing a 3500 sq foot residence at a 5000' desert-like elevation

The site has good sun exposure and the climate is generally dry. Typical
temperatures in Feb are 20-40 F. The building is mostly oriented
east-west
and has
a 2' deep insulated rock floor (for thermal mass) with active air

ICF's will be used as well as tile over concrete (above rock floor) in
south

I'm trying to get a realistic estimate of temperature swings and
auxiliary
heating
requirements. I've used eQuest, which seems pretty impressive and easy
to
use.
I've entered the floor plan layout, specified the glazing (clear glass
on

disappointing:
with 12% of the total floor space in south facing glass, the aux heating
required
is not too different (~20%) from a house with standard insulation and no

*increase*

I suspect that eQuest is not doing accurate modeling since other houses
with

anyone

Is there a more fundamental issue that is being missed here?  Lee Elson's
description includes the phrase "insulated rock floor with active air
recirculation".  It also includes "ICF", which I am not familiar with.

The description of the system appears to be a floor/rock-bed that uses a fan
to recirculate air between the rockbed and the space.  So solar falls
directly on the floor surface, but the floor also captures/releases heat
convectively using a fan.  

If that is the case, it is critical that the convective leg be simulated.
Assuming the space will not be allowed to be uncomfortably warm, and that
the rockbed temperature must be at least 70F to have any heating
effectiveness at all, this implies a very low delta-T between the rockbed
and the space when convectively charging or discharging the rockbed -
corresponding to a large, potentially drafty, airflow.  It also suggests
that the convective thermal capacity of the rockbed may be quite limited,
corresponding to a temperature swing on the order of 5F or less.  

It is essential that the fan energy of this system be modeled; with such a
small delta T between the rockbed and the space, the cost to run the fan may
exceed the cost of the heating energy saved by the convective component of
this system.

It would be helpful if Lee described the system in more detail.
eQUEST/DOE-2 does not simulate either convective rockbeds or the combined
radiant/convective rockbed floor that this building appears to use.  Do any
programs have this capability?

Hi-
You should try and get in touch with Prof Harvey Bryan from Arizona State 
University. He has done extensive reasearch on the Urban Heat Island 
phenomenon in Tempe and Phoenix, Arizona, which also included experimental 
evaluation.
Prof Bryan would be a great resource, and would be able to provide adequate 
guidance both for your theoretical and experimental research. He has also 
published a couple of papers on the topic.

In-Reply-To: 6667
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200504041103.AA0317109pd80000622044@gard.com>

Hi All,
I am working on a project where the air is delivered
to the building by means of several built-up AHU?s,
each of which will serve a distinct conditioning zone
within the building.  The AHU?s are designed to have
outside air (OA) enter the unit and pass through an
energy recovery wheel (ERW) which pretreats the
outside air and also can be supplied with 100% Outdoor
Air for both cooling and ventilation needs. Chilled
water and hotwater for cooling and heating coils in
the AHU is supplied by ground coupled heat pumps.

How would I model this system using EQUEST where the
AHU is connected to a geothermal heat pump.

Also, does anyone know of a configuration  where a
geothermal well system is  coupled with a displacement
ventilation system especially in a climate like New
England. If so, how did the boiler and Fin tube
Radiation tie into and how does the system perform to
date?

Thanks
Gerald

Here are two related items that may be of interest to you.

There's a Ph.D. thesis by Evyatar Erell on this topic, recently
completed at the University of Adelaide, Australia.  The Ph.D. adviser
was Dr. Terry Williamson at twilliamson at arch.adelaide.edu.au.  You might
want to communicate with him to see how to order the thesis.

What Erell developed is called the CAT (Canyon Air Temperature) computer
model, which predicts site-specific air temperature in a city street
based on data from an external reference station.  He conducted a site
monitoring program in Adelaide, recorded weather conditions continuously
at two city streets and at a reference location outside the city centre
for nearly a year. 

He concluded that the CAT model could be used to generate realistic,
site-specific temperature inputs for building thermal simulation
software, required to produce more accurate modeling of energy use.

Also, ASHRAE funded a research project (RP-606) that was completed in
1993, results of which are published in Technical paper 3665.  The title
is: "Determination of Climate Variation within Metropolitan Areas" by
Dufner, K. L., Bailey, D. T., Wolfe, D. E., Arya, S. P., ASHRAE Trans.
1993, vol.99, Part 1, Paper number 3665 (RP-606), 430-449.

Dear friends:
Sorry for taking your time.
I would like to  evaluate Urban Heat Island  phenomenon , which require
measuring and monitoring several 
environment  condition data ( i.e. Dry bulb, and wet bulb temperature,
humidity ,  moisture , wind speed ..etc) for a total distance  of 10km
from centre of  the city 'downtown' taken  at an increments radius of
100m. Which may 
 require of about 200 environment condition data measuring points, i.e
temperature, humdidty..etc  ?
 Follwoing points could be monitored using a PC-Software,  data logger
with several sensors 
I appreciate any suggestions, sharing previous experience information
i.e.  about the instrumentations ..etc.
Best regards,

Dear guys:
Sorry for take your time again.
Now we are working on a project in which we need to custom the chiller curve 
for both screwed chiller and the hermetic centrifugal one.
As i searched the Doe manual and the help files, the instruction suad that 
we can do this by input the raw data of chiller part load conditions. It 
works, but I still have some problems.
1 in the EIR-CHWT/ECT curve, what is the CHWT and ECT exactly mean?
Are they the leaving chillered water temperature and entering condensing 
temperature?
2 in the EIR-PLR/dT cueve,what is the delta temperature, or in other words, 
which two temperatures is used here to get the delta T.
3 i would like to know if there are any examples on how to do this, 

I attched my personnal curve here for your reference. By the way, the space 
cooling energy is a little big when using my curve compared with the ones 
from the lib. In my case, i applied all of my three personal curve.

Lee,

Doe2 (2.1 or 2.2) is not the right program for looking at heavy thermal
mass
buildings.  The limitation is a function of the thermal response factors
used to represent time-delayed heat transfer through opaque surfaces.  This
method is a legacy of the original DOE2 design requirements which were
somewhat hindered by slow computers.

You should use a simulation program that uses a more fundamental heat
balance approach.  There are several but I believe that ESP-r (ESRU,
University of Strathclyde) is one of the best.

I'm designing a 3500 sq foot residence at a 5000' desert-like elevation
(Nevada).
The site has good sun exposure and the climate is generally dry. Typical
temperatures in Feb are 20-40 F. The building is mostly oriented east-west
and has
a 2' deep insulated rock floor (for thermal mass) with active air
recirculation.
ICF's will be used as well as tile over concrete (above rock floor) in
south
facing rooms.

I'm trying to get a realistic estimate of temperature swings and auxiliary
heating
requirements. I've used eQuest, which seems pretty impressive and easy to
use.
I've entered the floor plan layout, specified the glazing (clear glass on
the
south side) and the building materials. The calculations are a bit
disappointing:
with 12% of the total floor space in south facing glass, the aux heating
required
is not too different (~20%) from a house with standard insulation and no
added
south facing glass. Another oddity: when I change the south facing glass
area from
5% of the available south wall to 90% of the south wall, I get an
*increase*
in
aux heating requirements. The eQuest developer thinks this is due to
inadequate
thermal mass/heat recirculation modeling.

I suspect that eQuest is not doing accurate modeling since other houses
with
a
similar design in this area get much better thermal performance. Can anyone
suggest either software or a service provider that might be able to do a
more
accurate calculation?

Don,

Take a look at the "Dictionary" that is part of the DOE-2.2 documentation.
It describes heat wheels in a fair amount of detail.  

Note that the default mode of operation is to run an energy recovery
ventilator whenever the HVAC fans are active; irrespective of whether the
heat reclaim is useful.  In actuality, this is a terrible mode, and will
typically consume more energy than it saves.  This mode is made the default
to force the user to think about how they actually want to control an energy
recovery ventilator.  These devices typically have relatively large static
pressure drops (~1"-2" on either side of the heat exchanger, including
filters) and can incur large energy penalties over the course of a year if
not controlled intelligently.  Penalties arise both in fan energy, as well
as possibly chiller energy if the ERV is working when cool outdoor air would
in fact be beneficial.

The algorithms include a fairly comprehensive set of control strategies so
that you can evaluate their merits.

Subject: [bldg-sim] EnergyPlus V 1.2.2 released
References: <MDAEMON-F200504252145.AA4554593pd80000697070@gard.com>

Regarding the EnergyPlus registration process...

WHY is a password needed?
  What is left to protect once the download is complete;
  the downloading entity is already known from the
  download process itself - the server log contains the
  IP address of the machine performing the download.
  Before the download is allowed other information has
  already been collected, so what does the password add
  to the process?

WHAT is the point in the password?
  Other than DOE getting a "confirmed" user email address;
  but why should providing this information be a requirement
  as it is easily changed at any time (immediately after
  obtaining the software, the email address can be abandoned,
  as it may have been a free yahoo or other untraceable
  account.
WHAT difference does it make?
  So you have an email address - what value is it, especially if
  the user would prefer to not supply that information.
WHY is the source code not included in the distribution?
  It is very difficult to use a complex program without the ability
  to look at the source to diagnose problems.  We distribute DOE-2
  source code, for all versions, within the DOE-2 executable program
  archives, all as freeware.  A similar readable version of EnergyPlus
  should be contained within the installed directory structure; what the big
  deal ... if you want wide use open it up to examination and
  review by all.
Why does the registration process require users to disclose
business information?
  This information may be interesting to DOE but should not be a
  requirement to obtain and use the software; we do not require
  this type of information for users to obtain eQUEST - in fact,
  no information is currently required to be provided to download,
  install, or use the freeware eQUEST.  Why is obtaining and using
  EnergyPlus, a US Government owned software, more restricted
  than a privately owned and maintained software?
Regarding EnergyPlus ownership, copyrights plus sue and sub-licensing ...

Are copyrights or other intellectual property rights in
EnergyPlus owned by the Government or others?
  The DOE contract with LBNL gives all rights to the government unless
  the Government explicitly awards them to LBNL.  Here is the contract language:
   
  Modification No.: M411
  Supplemental Agreement to
  Contract No.: DE-AC03-76SF00098

  CLAUSE 7.2 - RIGHTS IN DATA- TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER ACTIVITIES (SPECIAL)
  NOTE: This clause applies to data and copyrightable works created by Contractor employees at
  the Laboratory or by Contractor employees assigned to the Laboratory doing work under this
  contract for the Laboratory at a location other than the Laboratory.  .....

  (a) Definitions.
  (1) "Computer Software," as used in the clause, means computer data bases and computer
  program and documentation thereof.
  ...
  (b) Allocation of rights.
  (1) Except as may be otherwise expressly provided or directed in writing by the DOE
  Patent Counsel, the Government shall have:
  (i) Ownership of all Technical Data and Computer Software first produced in the
  performance of this contract;
  ...
  (c) Copyright (general).
  (1) The Contractor agrees not to mark, register or otherwise assert a copyright in any data
  in a published or unpublished work, other than as set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) below.
Have those rights, for work paid for by the Government, been awarded to others?

  LBNL can request, and DOE can grant, the copyright ability; here
  is the contract language:
   
  (e) Copyrighted works (other than scientific and technical articles).
  (1) The Contractor may obtain permission to assert copyright subsisting in Technical Data
  and Computer Software first produced by the Contractor in performance of this contract, where
  the Contractor can show that commercialization would be enhanced by such copyright
  protection, subject to the following:
  (i) Contractor request to assert copyright.
  (A) For data other than scientific and technical articles, the Contractor shall submit
  in writing to Patent Counsel its request to assert copyright in data first produced in the
  performance of this contract pursuant to this clause. Each request by the Contractor to be
  complete must include: the identity of the data (including any computer program) for which the
  Contractor requests permission to assert copyright, as well as an abstract which is descriptive of
  the data and is suitable for dissemination purposes; the program under which it was funded;
  whether the data is subject to an international treaty or agreement; whether the data is subject to
  export control; a statement that the Contractor plans to commercialize the data within five years
  of obtaining permission to assert copyright; 
  (B) Permission for the Contractor to assert copyright in excepted categories of data
  as determined by DOE is expressly withheld. Such excepted categories include data whose
  release ... would not enhance the appropriate transfer or dissemination and commercialization of
  such data; would have a negative impact on United States industrial competitiveness ...
It would seem those rights are in questions since only DOE distributes EnergyPlus
but the software contains the following copyright notice (readme.txt/pdf in install directory):
  Copyright ? 1996-2005 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois and
  The Regents of the University of California through Ernest Orlando Lawrence
  Berkeley National Laboratory.  All rights reserved.

  This seem to "assert copyright" ... so who owns the copyright?

Yet the license implies but does not "assert" copyright and implies that LBNL
may not have the required rights to distribute (it does not distribute) or license
the product ("Subject to receipt" language below):
  Contained in EnergyPlus 1.2.2 (current version downloaded 26 February 2005)

   

  ENERGYPLUS(tm)

  END  USER  LICENSE  AGREEMENT

  Software: EnergyPlus

  Version: 1.2



  LICENSE GRANT. Subject to receipt by Berkeley Lab of any required U.S. Department of Energy approvals, Berkeley Lab grants you, and you hereby accept, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free perpetual license to install and use the version noted above of the computer software program noted above, in executable code format only, together with any associated media, printed materials, and on-line or electronic documentation (if any) provided by Berkeley Lab (collectively, the "Software"), subject to the following terms and conditions:

  (a)       You may use the Software solely for your own internal use;

  (b)       You may not transfer the Software to any third party without the prior written consent of Berkeley Lab; you may not allow the Software to be accessed or used over the internet by any third party;

  (c)       You may copy the Software solely for backup and archival purposes; provided however that (i) you must reproduce all copyright notices and other proprietary notices on any copies of the Software and you must not remove or alter those notices; and (ii) all copies of the Software shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement;

  (d)       You may not reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Software.  You may not modify, alter, or create derivative works of the Software in any manner; and

  (e)       You may not rent, lease, loan, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Software to any third party, nor use the Software for commercial time-sharing or service bureau use.

What does "solely for your own internal use" mean and why is it in the license? 

Most of us perform services for others so we are violating this license. 

Why is  this language needed?  Why is it necessary to restrict the use

in any way.

  By contrast the eQUEST license (private ownership) is non-restrictive

  as follows:



  eQUEST(TM) END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT


  GRANT OF LICENSE.
  This EULA grants you the following rights:
  * Installation and Use. You may install and use a copy of the 
  SOFTWARE on any computer owned by, rented to, or leased to, you 
  or your company.



  Our DOE-2 Licenses (like EnergyPlus, a simulation program not including

  a user interface like eQUEST) use terms are as follows:



  License to Use Software
  You may:

  ?   Install and use the Software on any computer owned, rented or leased by yourself or your company.

  ?   Make backup copies of the Software for use allowed by this license.

  You may not:

  ?   Distribute the Software in any way to any third party.

  ?   Make copies of the Software for any purpose other than as a backup.

  ?   Sell, rent, or lease the software.

  ?   Transfer any of your rights under this license to a third party. 

  ?   Modify, adapt, or translate the Software.

  You must:

  ?   Maintain all copyright notices on all copies of the Software.

  ?   Keep a copy of this license agreement with the Software.





 

Why is "you may not allow the Software to be accessed or used over the internet by any third party" needed?
Does not (a) provide the same limitation?  Why not allow it anyway?
 

What does "nor use the Software for commercial time-sharing or service bureau use"

mean and why is this language needed?  Seems to again limit users' ability to use the

software in the process of performing services for others.

I have been a proponent of the Canadian way of
designing houses for several years.  I believe that
one can get excellent results by using their methods
and will get the best bang for the dollar.  

For example:  In 1983 I built a 2300 square foot house
in Montrose, Colorado (6200 HDD) and I heated it with
electric resistive heat.  Since I worked for the
electric utility and we wanted to get this technology
introduced we metered the electric heat separately. 
The house uses between 700 kWh to 900 kWh per YEAR for
heating. In 1984 the usage was 862 kWh's (no wood
stove).  At $.08 /kWh this is a $69 YEARLY heating
bill. 

With this non-solar technology it is easy to achieve
good results and doesn't require sofisticated
calculations as with passive solar where one needs to
get the glass/mass ratio correct or with other
technologies.

I have prescriptive standards that I designed based on
HDD but I prefer computer modeling.  I will share this
information with anybody that is interested.

The "air fired" surge gravel ( 2" to 6" ) rock bed
storage is easily beaten by an  "over square Water
fired" active / passive combo. Ours has been running
since January '87.  After accounting for an 85%
reduction in DHW load from active solar  AND 50%
reduction in wall plug load via lighting and other
measures AND savings from a 2.5 / 4 ton 2 speed heat
pump ;  we still beat Energy 10 V1.6 estimates of our
energy use by 700+ kwhr /month. Our E-10 model has
been   defined over 28 iterations against weather
data.  This design won an ASME region V design contest
in 1980. General Tips

1) WALLS 2x6 stud 24" OC  1" blue styrofoam sheathing
on outside,   steel diagonal bracing. R-19 fiberglass.
Tan brick veneer all walls above  grade. 57s gravel 4
ft deep below basement slab; 1" styro Tbreak inside
basement walls to footings, 2" Styro outside basement
walls to footings. S side basement is 100% height walk
out. 

2) WINDOWS -- You have to use casement or awning
windows because they   seal air leakage better than
anything else. Patio door only 1 allowed, South side
only.    N/E/W sides LoE2 glazing, S side LoE2 or
double clear. All windows & patio   door have night
insulation. Prefer fewer larger windows over more
numerous  smaller windows for E/W/S.  ie  Andersen
CW-24s  a  4640 Double casement.    N side gets 
CW-14s a  2440? Single casement.    Patio Door gets
lightshelf daylight hours in heating season..

3) SKYLIGHT  -- ONE only above freezer openable .
Freezer precharges skylight shaft with warm air !! Now
you are ready for a quick blow off to shed heat at
sundown or to keep kitchen smoke contained ...........
we have 10 ft ceilings in  the Kitchen.

4) OVERHANG  2ft on E W N sides, 4 ft on S --two story
height. We are at 38-45-00 N.

5) Roof is 6/12 pitch  20 deg W of South, recommend
8/12 or 12/12   for new install.    Basement  slab w/
900 ft + HDPE pipe, would use  REHAU  PEX for new
install. 

6) You will find a fan does not provide the flow
pressure required to spread out the heat  in a really
large rock bed ( ~ 2" water gauge ). You need a
centrifugal blower ( ~ 10" WG)   it  will be louder
than a fan.

I live in a passive (and active) solar home with rock
bed storage in my sunroom in Golden, Colorado. We did
not design this house ourselves....

There is about 4 feet of rocks underneath wooden
boards with about 1/2" of space between the boards and
the rocks start about 1 foot below the boards.

There is also brick on both walls. It gets really hot
in this room in the winter (and in the summer since it
was not designed with proper overhangs so we need to
add some exterior overhangs as well). There used to be
a duct and fan to blow heat to the floor above, but it
was removed by the previous owners probably due to
aesthetics since it was right in the middle of the
sunroom. Due to the airspace, there are a lot of bugs
and dust that collect on the rock bed. Frankly, I
think the sunspace itself is quite sufficient with the
brick and glazing alone, and due to indoor air quality
concerns, we will likely take out the rock bed or seal
it up. So if you do this rock bed, make sure it is
well sealed so bugs and dust cannot collect on it,
especially if you are going to blow air through it. 

And if it is already going to be located in a sun
room, it may not be necessary if you have brick or
another high mass feature in the space. It sounds like
yours is going over tile. You'd have to design it to
make sure the rocks below the tile heat up.

Subject: [bldg-sim] EnergyPlus V 1.2.2 released
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200504252145.AA4558750pd80000649549@gard.com>

The newest version of EnergyPlus (1.2.2) was released
on April 22, 2005 (Earth Day!) and is now available
in versions for both the Windows and Linux operating
systems. You can download EnergyPlus at no cost from
the EnergyPlus web site:  www.energyplus.gov .

What's New in Version 1.2.2?

A few of the new features are listed below.
See www.energyplus.gov/features.html for a complete
list of new features added in this and previous
versions:
 -- modeling of ventilated photovoltaic roof and
    other cladding systems
 -- natural cross ventilation
 -- simplified definition of HVAC systems
 -- refrigerated casework
 -- variable speed cooling towers
 -- link to SPARK to simulate complex equipment and
    systems not in EnergyPlus
 -- more than 2,200 pages of documentation
and speed improvements throughout.


User Interfaces

Several interfaces and utilities for EnergyPlus are
available. EP-Quick creates an EnergyPlus input file
based on a broad range of zone templates.  EP-Quick
was released in April 2005. E2AC is an interface in
Portuguese available in a beta version (since January
2005). An English version of E2AC is planned in the
next few months. DesignBuilder is a full-featured
interface available in a beta version. Several other
interfaces are under development. Watch our web site
(www.energyplus.gov/ep_interfaces.html ) for up-to-date
information on these and other interfaces.

A number of utilities and tools for creating, editing,
and running input files come with EnergyPlus,
including IDF Editor, EP-Launch, and HVAC-Diagram (see
www.energyplus.gov/ep_utilities.html ). Third party
tools for creating, editing, and displaying EnergyPlus
input files are also available, including DrawBDL,
EcoTect, Green Building Studio, EzDrawPlus, IFCtoIDF,
TSe+, and EzPlus-Parm.  See
www.energyplus.gov/third_party_tools.html for more
information.


What can I expect with V1.2.2?

      Are there considerable differences between
      version 1.2.2 and 1.2.1?

            Yes.... and no. There are a number of
            new features and bug fixes.

      How about IDF and IDD? Do they remain unchanged?

            There will be some changes in the IDD and
            reflected in IDFs. Particularly for any
            new features, there will be new objects.

      Is version 1.2.2 backward compatible? Can I
      run a v1.2.1 file in v1.2.2?

            For the most part, the answer is yes.
            Some report variables have changed
            names.  To be sure, you can execute
            the transition program  that will
            "transition" IDFs from V1.2.1 to V1.2.2.
            You can also view the ObjectStatus
            spreadsheet in the root folder of the
            installed version. This file has detailed
            explanations of changes to the objects.


EnergyPlus Weather Data

More than 240 weather files have been added to the
EnergyPlus web site since the last release. Weather
data for more than 900 locations in 100 countries are
available on the EnergyPlus web site:
www.energyplus.gov/weatherdata.html.  If you have
other weather data that you'd be willing to share with
other EnergyPlus users, please contact the EnergyPlus team.


Thanks!

The "air fired" surge gravel ( 2" to 6" ) rock bed storage is easily 
beaten by an
"over square Water fired" active / passive combo. Ours has been running 
since
January '87.  After accounting for an 85% reduction in DHW load from active
solar  AND 50% reduction in wall plug load via lighting and other 
measures AND
savings from a 2.5 / 4 ton 2 speed heat pump ;  we still beat Energy 10  
V1.6 estimates of our energy use by 700+ kwhr /month. Our E-10 model has 
been refined over 28 iterations against weather data.  This design won 
an  ASME region V design contest in 1980. General Tips >>>

1) WALLS 2x6 stud 24" OC  1" blue styrofoam sheathing on outside,
steel diagonal bracing. R-19 fiberglass. Tan brick veneer all walls above
grade.  57s gravel 4 ft deep below basement slab; 1" styro Tbreak inside 
basement
walls to footings, 2" Styro outside basement walls to footings. S side 
basement is 100%
height walk out.

2) WINDOWS -- You have to use casement or awning windows because they
seal air leakage better than anything else. Patio door only 1 allowed, 
South side only.
N/E/W sides LoE2 glazing, S side LoE2 or double clear. All windows & patio
door have night insulation. Prefer fewer larger windows over more numerous
smaller windows for E/W/S.  ie  Andersen CW-24s  a  4640 Double casement.
N side gets  CW-14s a  2440? Single casement.
Patio Door gets lightshelf daylight hours in heating season..

3) SKYLIGHT  -- ONE only above freezer openable . Freezer precharges 
skylight
shaft with warm air !! Now you are ready for a quick blow off to shed 
heat at sundown
or to keep kitchen smoke contained ........... we have 10 ft ceilings 
in  the Kitchen.

4) OVERHANG  2ft on E W N sides, 4 ft on S --two story height. We are 
at  38-45-00 N.

5) Roof is 6/12 pitch  20 deg W of South, recommend 8/12 or 12/12   for 
new install.
Basement  slab w/ 900 ft + HDPE pipe, would use  REHAU  PEX for new 
install.

6) You will find a fan does not provide the flow pressure required to 
spread out the heat
in a really large rock bed ( ~ 2" water gauge ). You need a centrifugal 
blower ( ~ 10" WG)
it  will be louder than a fan.

Xiaobing-

You may have a couple options here.

1.  The easiest thing to do would be to add an interior wall (ceiling) to
connect the gym space to the "under roof" space.
    a.  If the gym space is actually open all the way to the roof, the
interior wall construction should be entered as an "air wall" (U-value=1.00)
to allow complete heat transfer between the spaces.  Both the gym and "under
roof" spaces and zones should be designated as "conditioned" and be served
by the same HVAC system.  The roof load would then show up in the LS-C
report as a roof load.

    b.  If the gym space is not open to the roof, the interior wall
construction should be whatever the actual materials are with the
corresponding U-value to allow heat transfer between the two spaces.
(eQuest will not calculate heat transfer between spaces without an interior
surface to connect the spaces.)  The "under roof" space and zone would
remain "unconditioned".  The load from the roof would show up in the LS-C
report indirectly as an interior surface load.

2.  If the gym space is actually open all the way to the roof, your other
option would be to transfer all exterior surfaces from the "under roof"
space and attach them to the gym space.  Then eliminate the "under roof"
space and zone.

Hope this helps.  Have a nice weekend.

  Subject: [bldg-sim] eQUEST question


  Dear eQUEST users:

  I meet a problem when I use eQUEST to model a gymnasium, which has a
pitched roof. eQUEST automatically separate the gymnasium to two spaces: one
is a cube-shape "Space" (under the roof) and the other is a triangle- shape
"Under Roof". While the "Space" is specified as conditioned, the "Under
Roof" is specified as un-conditioned by eQUEST.

  As shown in the report LS-B (Space Peak Load Components), there is no load
from roof for the "Space" but there is load from roof for the "Under Roof".
However, as shown in the report LS-C (Building Peak Load Components), only
the loads for the "Space" are accounted for. So, my question is where the
load from roof is? In the simulated gymnasium, there is no ceiling and the
roof is exposed to the space of the gymnasium. As a result, the load from
roof should be included (at least partially) in the building peak load,
which needs to be treated by the HVAC system. Am I right? Does eQUEST
actually account for this load although it doesn't show in the report LS-C?

  Your suggestions and comments is highly appreciated.

  Xiaobing

Hi,
I was wondering if anyone had the TMY2 (BIN file) for Fort Collins, CO
and would be willing to share it.
If you pick Ft. Collins as the location city in eQUEST; by default it
selects the weather file of Cheyenne, WY which I believe, might not be
too accurate.
Thank you,

I've a question related to WLHP/GSHP simulation of eQUEST. In current eQUEST, the fan power of a WLHP/GSHP system is calculated and reported separately from the electricity consumption for cooling or heating. Is it necessary (or proper) since the fan power is usually included in the total power of the water-to-air heat pump unit. Doesn't the performance curve of EIR for water-to-air heat pump include the fan power?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200504201146.AA4601890pd80000643987@gard.com>

New weather data for 242 locations in Brazil, China, Ethiopia, Ghana,
Italy, Kenya, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka are now available in E/E
(EnergyPlus/ESP-r) weather format:

Chinese Typical Year Weather (CTYW)
Developed for use in simulating building heating and air conditioning loads
and energy use, and for calculating renewable energy utilization, this set
of 57 weather files is based on a 1982-1997 period of record with data
obtained from the U. S. National Climatic Data Center. These data were
developed by Joe Huang of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  The
original data set was created by Prof. ZHANG Qingyuan of Tsukuba University
Japan, in collaboration with Joe Huang of Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory. Development of the original typical year weather files is
documented in Zhang Qingyuan and Joe Huang. 2004. Chinese Typical Year
Weather Data for Architectural Use (in Chinese). ISBN 7-111-14810-X.
Beijing: China Machine Press.


Italian Climatic data collection "Gianni De Giorgio" (IGDG)
Developed for use in simulating renewable energy technologies, this set of
66 weather files is based on a 1951-1970 period of record. The data were
created by Professor Livio Mazzarella, Politecnico di Milano, and is named
in honor of Gianni de Giorgio.


Solar and Wind Energy Resource Assessment (SWERA)
The Solar and Wind Energy Resource Assessment (SWERA) project, funded by
the United Nations Environment Program, is developing high quality
information on solar and wind energy resources in 14 developing countries.
Previously typical year hourly data were available for 37 locations in
Belize, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.  An
additional 119 locations in Brazil, China, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya,
Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka have recently been released. (More
information on SWERA is available on their web site: http://swera.unep.net/
).

???

These new data bring the total number of weather files available on the
EnergyPlus web site to more than 900 with 295 in the US, 55 in Canada, and
560 in 100 other countries.  All the new data are available for download
from the EnergyPlus web site:

http://www.energyplus.gov/cfm/weatherdata.html

If you know of other typical weather data that could be shared with
EnergyPlus and ESP-r users (or the 15 other simulation programs that can
read E/E weather files), please contact us directly.  We know of two other
data sets in preparation--for India and Portugal--which we will post to the
web site as they become available.

TREAT is a simulation tool designed to support single family and multifamily
energy audit with an hourly simulation tool.  The tool provides economic
analysis and fuel bill analysis using weather normalization routine based on
imported actual daily weather.  The tool allows the creation of detailed
improvements and the bundling of these improvements into multiple packages
for analysis of interactivity and comparison across bundles of improvements.

Although the tool is focused on residential structures, users also have
adapted the tool for use in small commercial and office buildings.  

TREAT uses the SUNREL simulation core developed by NREL for hourly loads
analysis.  TREAT is used by single family and multifamily energy audit and
installation programs in a number of states as well as by private users.

Hello,

I encountered a similar problem when calculating Direct radiation on an
arbitrary oriented and tilted surface, from horizontal diffuse and direct
radiation. If solar height is Hs and Dh hourly horizontal energy recived, it
appears that the term that causes unexpected values of radiation in the
formula was Dh/sin(Hs), when the sun is going down (Hs goes to 0).
Specifically, it is well known these two values represents for the first one
an hourly energy and for the second an instantaned position of the sun.
It is then necessary to know how theses two values where computed (or
mesured) to correct and eventually filter these anormal values.

I used the formula from ASHRAE Fundamentals 2001,

Solar Flux, Equation 10~24,  to simulate the direct,
diffuse, and reflect solar radiation on a south wall

The result seems close to, or at an acceptable scale
of, the measured solar data (as recorded in nrel.gov
website) for 5~19:00 hr of a day. But there are sharp
spikes before 4:00 and after 20:00. The maximal value
of the spikes for direct radiation gets to 5000w/m2,
for diffuse radiation gets to 1200w/m2. This is
unexpected to me. I tried someone else's code and
result was very similar. May there be an explanation
for this?


Thank you very much.

One analysis that I'd recommend is the PhD thesis by Sylvester 1999 "An analysis of the benefits of photovoltaic-coated glazing on owning and operating costs of high rise comm bldgs", Texas A&M Univ.  In it you'll find experimental and simulations that show various effects of the PV in several loactions. One of the results shows that the BIPV saves more on the resultant cooling reductions from the reduced solar load than the electricity that is produced.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] thermal impact of BIPV

Hi,
 
I am looking for research on the thermal impact of Building Integrated PVs (BIPV). Any experimental and or simulation data of PV roof integrations and their impact on the energy flow through the building envelope. Has there been any comparison between the BIPVs and regular building component heat flows, including factors such as the insulation level, the reflectance, thermal properties of the PVs as a layer and any shading.
 
Thanks,

Sounds like a bug in your incidence angle calculation, which you must shut-off for hours before sunrise and after sunset. I'd suggest you consult a solar text for more info., such as Kreith, Kreider and Goswami, or of course Duffie-Beckman.

Danni,
Do you see the spikes before resolving the solar beam onto the wall? If
so, you may need to test the solar altitude angle is greater than 1 or 2
degrees above the horizon AND/OR test for sunrise/sunset times.

If the unresolved data looks OK, check for angle of incidence onto the
wall.  I haven't checked the location, but you must be very close to
glancing incidence at these times.

HTH
Steve.

The project would not be eligible for an ID credit but the energy produced 
by the PV system will count toward EAc1.  The energy produced should be 
multiplied by the virtual rate from the proposed building model and this 
dollar amount subtracted from the modeling results for the proposed 
building.  This value is then used for the calculation which determines the 
percentage savings for EAc1.  This could be worth another point if it is 
enough to move you into the next point range.

Also FYI the USGBC EA Technical Advisory Group (TAG) is currently 
considering changing the definition of renewable energy which will allow 
solar thermal applications to count under EAc2.

Actually Debra,
You should get credit for it under EAc1.1
There is a provision for renewable energy in the ECB calculations (PV should count as renewable energy).
 
The way it works is to get the DEC'', you use the following (Correct me if I am wrong here)
 
DEC'' = DEC' - REC'
 
where
 
DEC' = Design Energy Cost before PV ($)
REC'  = Renewable component ($)
 
The energy cost savings are then calculated as
 
Savings % = [(ECB' - DEC'')/ECB'] * 100
 
 
Hope this helps

Hi Greenies, 

I assume LEED will not give an ID credit for an installation of either a solar electric or a solar thermal system, since solar thermal will count towards EAc1.1 and there already is a renewable energy credit. 

In our case, the PV system will not generate the required 5% thus the project will get no credit for it. Our project is using both solar thermal and PV. 

Does anyone know of any specific projects where the USGBC gave the project an ID credit for using either. 

Many Thanks!!!!
