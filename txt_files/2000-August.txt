Simulation Specialists, Building and Energy System Modelers:

ERI Services has positions available for Analysis Engineers.  These
engineers will analyze energy efficiency projects at governmental and CII
facilities in the development of Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC)
projects. Candidates must demonstrate a proven ability to perform and
document complex, large-scale engineering analyses of energy intensive
facilities. The engineer will develop, evaluate, run and document
quantitative energy use models for energy using components, systems and
buildings and conduct some of the field evaluations in support of these
activities.
Requires a BSME or equivalent (MS preferred) and a minimum of 2 years of
experience analyzing building energy use by components and systems relating
to operations, HVAC equipment and controls, central chiller and boiler
plants and process systems. Excellent simulation modeling experience  is
required, preferably using DOE2. In addition, experience with bin and

I have recollection of  simulation studies done in the 70s or 80s to
determine the economic and energy efficiency of powered attic fans,
perhaps as an adjunct to refrigeration cooling in residences. As I
recall,
they were not cost effective. Can anyone here point me to reports

hi

I am looking for some advice.  I am a mere architect, so I have lurked for some time with limited understanding of messages on this list.  

I seldom get projects complex enough to require (or finance) proper simulation,  but I often think that my planning for sunlight & daylight should be based on more than intuition.  

Can anyone recommend information or software to help me?   I have invested in the "Planning for Sunlight & Daylight" publication by the Building Research Establishment here in the UK, with its charming transparent protractors, but I would like an easier way of tracking shadow and predicting internal lighting (roughly).  

I guess it is the complexity of the building shapes which is the problem.  I model projects in Vectorworks (CAD package), and being a designer I use a Mac of course.  My work is all near here in London.

Any advice will be gratefully received.

Tom Dine

Excuse me if you consider this SPAM or off-topic, but if you have to
simulate geothermal heat pumps you should realy look at what TESS has
done with TRNSYS:

DOE2.2 has a Ground-Loop-HX that can model horizontal or vertical wells of a
ground-source heat pump when attached to a circulation loop.  The
capabilities are considered to be in the "testing mode", but the fairly
detailed model is fully documented in the DOE2.2 support docs.

This GRI site supplies free data from all the main NWS stations.

http://www.gri.org/cgi-bin/re?url=http%3A//www.gri.org/pub/solutions/desiccant/index.html

It provides hourly temp, moisture, pressure and wind, one month at a time.
Currently it only has data through Jan 10, 2000, but it has kept up better in
the past. Let us know if you find a source where multiple months of recent
hourly data can be assembled into single files and downloaded. Out here, the
regional climate center will do this fairly quickly for $50 or so.

Peter;
DOE2 is not a great tool for naturally ventilated building analysis.

However, I recently used the sunspace venting commands for this. There
are special requirements for this zone type (must be attached to a
non-sunspace zone in some manner, accurate geometric representation of
all surfaces including interiors...), limitations, caveats, and some
gross simplifications in venting flow calcs. So you must be careful
and check the hourly zone temps and flows. However, most system types
can be applied to a sunspace zone, as opposed to the natural
ventilation keywords which work in their odd manner only with PSZ
systems. Can't say from here if using sunspaces is "quick and
appropriate," for your model, though.

I seem to recall that the units given for zone keyword SS-VENT-xx
(ach, ach/knot, ach/degF) in my copy of the E "supplement" manual
differed from the units apparently used in the actual program (DOE2.1e
JJH v133).  (I think the temperature correlation factor appeared to be
cfm/degF, but I seem to be having a little laptop/desktop
discontinuity and can't find the deck I debugged.) Repeat: Check
hourly reports of pertinent zone variables!

Please don't grovel next time; just offer a lifetime of free Arup CFD
analysis to the lucky winner.

Hope this helps;

Building Sim Group:

I'm looking for a sample of the new NCDC hourly weather file format, the
"TD-3280" format.  NCDC has a sample file on their web site, called
"Sample3280.txt", but it does not correspond to their published description
of the 3280 format.  Hmm, go figure.  A year's worth of data for any site
would be great, but even a few days of data would be very helpful.
Apparently there is a "fixed record length" and a "variable record length"
format, either of these would work fine for my needs.

Thanks,
