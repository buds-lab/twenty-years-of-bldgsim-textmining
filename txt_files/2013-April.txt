ENERGY AND CLIMATE CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION ENGINEER

Transsolar is an international climate engineering firm with offices in Stuttgart (Germany), Munich, and New York.  We are seeking talented, highly motivated engineers for our New York office.

Transsolar develops and validate concepts for high quality environments that require minimal energy use. To achieve this we work collaboratively within the design team from the start of the design process, considering each step from the standpoint of fundamental thermodynamics. This generates a climate concept in which form, material, and mechanical systems are synergistic components of a well-orchestrated climate control system; and conversely, an environmental control strategy that is integral to the architectural concept.

We use a wide variety of complex computer simulation tools to evaluate our concepts, developing unique analytical methods based on a deep understanding of engineering physics. We perform dynamic thermal simulation using TRNSYS to develop and validate appropriate, reliable concepts in relationship to the complex set of factors that is unique to each project. Similarly, we perform daylight simulations using RADIANCE and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using FLUENT. 

Transsolar engineers carry out a broad range of tasks. Responsibilities for this position include:

-Development of climate and energy concepts in response to local climate, site, architectural, and programmatic requirements
-Development, testing and validation of concepts via thermal simulation (TRNSYS)
-Engineering analysis via EES, hand calculation, spreadsheet analysis, and other engineering analysis tools
-Programming of new simulation and analysis tools in TRNSYS, EES, spreadsheets, and with other computational methods
-Internal coordination with other simulation specialists, synthesis, and communication of overall analysis results
-Graphical representation of climate concepts and complex engineering analysis
-Writing reports and correspondence
-Participation in meetings and design charettes
-Collaboration with German Transsolar offices
-Domestic and international travel to project meetings and sites

Engineers with an emphasis on dynamic thermal simulation are our highest priority.   Both entry-level positions and positions for 3-5 years experience are available.  Our New York office is small but growing, providing ample opportunity for advancement.

Preferred qualifications include:

-Engineering or applied science education related to building energy flows and building science: heat transfer, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, indoor and outdoor human comfort, etc. Ideal is a degree in mechanical engineering or applied physics. An M.S. is strongly preferred.
-Experience with computational engineering analysis (text-based input, computer programming, scripting such as Perl, spreadsheet analysis and macro programming such as VBA)
-Experience with dynamic thermal simulation (energy simulation)
-Proven ability to creatively develop and apply non-traditional climate solutions to the indoor environment
-Education/professional experience with current and advanced architectural technologies (e.g. building envelope) and mechanical systems for building climate control 
-Experience with physical testing of engineering systems: system construction, instrumentation and measurement, etc.
-Experience collaborating and communicating in the early stages of an architectural design process with both technical and non-technical audiences
-Excellent oral and written communication skills
-Computer-based drawing skills (e.g. Corel Draw, Adobe Illustrator, etc)

Applicants with an architectural background will not be considered; an engineering- or science-based degree is required for this position.  Prior experience with TRNSYS is not required.
Interested applicants may submit their resume and cover letter via email to nycjobs at transsolar.com

Message-ID: <B7FE24EB2E85FD47B9EB4A8DA59E76EFAC1EFEC3D2@TREXCHMAIL.corp.tridel.com>

Hello everyone,

A quick question regarding ASHRAE 90.1-2007 lighting control requirements (as I typically model buildings in Canada, and am not used to referencing ASHRAE 90.1).

Appendix G references section 9.4.1 for control, which states that automatic controls (e.g. occupancy sensors) are required in certain classrooms, conference/meeting rooms and lunch/break rooms.  Does this mean that I will need to model the appropriate LPD reduction factor per Table G3.2  in these spaces in the reference building, as well as the proposed model (if they are installed)? I.e., no credit given?  90.1-2010 seems to expand on this, identifying occupant sensors specifically, and adding restrooms, small offices, lockers rooms and some storage room.

Do I have this right?

Thanks,

In spirit we're on the same page, but in practice I've come to approach this slightly differently:

I do not touch the Baseline model at all in regards to classrooms, breakrooms, and conference/meeting rooms.  Rather, I understand that the fractional lighting schedule used in both models is taken to represent the prescriptively required sensors (there's language in Table G3.1 along these lines), and in turn I simply do not allow for an LPD reduction for those spaces in the Proposed model.

I expect the two approaches probably do not have a meaningfully different end-result for most projects, but can anecdotally affirm the above approach has made it through several LEED reviews.

Folks,

UI-IDL Boise has openings for intern positions. This position is open 
for all, not only for current (grad) students. Both positions 
potentially come with a tuition fee waiver for a graduate program at 
Univ of Idaho.

Informal questions can be directed to myself (eryd at uidaho.edu) or Gunnar 
Gladics (gunnarg at uidaho.edu).

The links are below for mechanical engineering and architectural interns.

The IBPSA - NCC quarterly meeting will be held on Wednesday April 17th, 2013, 6 - 7:30pm @Ebert and Baumann offices in central DC.

INFILTRATION AND SIMULATION - MODELING AIR TIGHTNESS IN BUILDING

Speaker: Lisa Ng, Mechanical Engineer at NIST

"Consideration of Envelope Airtightness in Modelling Commercial Building Energy Consumption"

Lisa graduated from Drexel University with a B. S. in Architectural Engineering, concentration on HVAC systems. While at Drexel, she completed co-ops with a construction management, a project management, and an HVAC design/consultation firm. After graduation, she lived and worked in Taipei, Taiwan for two years for an architect as a mechanical engineer.

In 2005, Lisa began her Ph.D. work at Drexel University, focusing her work on indoor air quality and sensor placement. In 2010, Lisa graduated with a Ph. D. in Civil Engineering with a thesis titled "Framework for the Utilization of Forward and Inverse Airflow Models in Systematic Sensor System Design for Indoor Air".

After graduation, Lisa completed a one year post-doc at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Currently, she is a mechanical engineer in the IAQ and Ventilation Group at the NIST in Gaithersburg, MD. Her work includes airflow, IAQ, and energy simulations, as well as IAQ sampling in a net zero house.

Maria,

Yes, there is a model for ice and eutectic thermal energy storage in
DOE-2.1E PLANT.  I've actually used it more than 12 years ago to model the
first LEED-Gold office building in China, so I can vouch that it gave
reasonable results.

Hi, I'm doing a LEED certificate project and I encounter a difficult problem.
The review questioned the building area that the "Total site energy"/"energy intensity per gross-area" are different in the baseline and proposed cases, according to BEPS. However, in LV-B, the total building areas are the same in both cases.
Can anybody figure it out? I don't know how to explain it.

The BEPS report uses the conditioned area. Your "conditioned" areas might be different between the Proposed and the Baselie. Compare the floor areas you get at the LS-C reports (on top of that report).

Dear
all,
?
We are
running a questionnaire as part of our research project called ?Developing better outputs from building thermal
simulation tools to improve decision making in the design of low energy
buildings? and
would be really happy if you could complete it.
?
It is very short, and can be found at;
?
https://www.surveys.cardiff.ac.uk/simulation
The questionnaire is part of a study that aims to
promote and aid the design
of the next generation of energy-efficient low carbon buildings through the
development of appropriate simulation post-processing and data representation
systems that can be more easily integrated into the design process than?current
ones. The questions refer to goals, aims and actions involved in design
activities as well as to analysis processes and useful information to design
decision making. They refer to how building designers work and act in practice
and are useful for simulation software developers to produce meaningful
post-processed information and data representation systems to building
designers.
?
For
further information on the project please see;

Answers to some more questions

DOE2.1E runs in the Command Prompt (DOS) window.

I could not run it with 64-bit computer and Windows 7.

It works with Windows XP Mode & Virtual PC in Windows 7 (see attachment)

I still prefer the BDL method of input because you are left with a text
specifications or report of the building loads, systems, plant & economics.

I have templates to model most of the features of DOE2.1E schedules, loads,
systems, plant & economics (see attached examples - not executable)

I think it is possible to do all this with EnergyPlus also.

The eQUEST method of tracing AutoCad drawings is an excellent method to
create the building physical model.

It is fast & accurate and easy to check.

Varkie, others,

I don't have any troubles running my version of DOE-2.1E on a 64-bit machine.  This may 
have something to do with the source code or compilation, since my version is the latest 
available from LBNL (same as from ESTSC), Version 124, dated 2008.   I'm in the process of 
setting up an open-source center through which this DOE-2.1E code and executable will be 
made available and maintained.   Until that time, anyone with interest in this version of 
DOE-2.1E can  send me an e-mail.

different versions of DOE2.1e from the command line, all work as expected.

 Non-Residential?
Message-ID: <DUB103-W38C8594F582A476434C683E0C70@phx.gbl>

Dear Bldg Sim,

I'm looking for guidance on the definition of a University Dormitory building that I'm modeling under LEED 2009, particularly referencing Table G3.1.1A Baseline HVAC System Types. The building has 9 storeys above grade with an underground basement, with a total floor area of approx. 125,000 sq. ft.

The Basement is primarily crawlspace, electrical, mechanical, student storage etc.

The Main Floor consists of a number of multi-purpose rooms, further storage facilities for bicycles, recycling etc, with 1/3 of the main floor plan dedicated to student residences.

The remaining floors, 2 - 9, are student residences with a number of break out/study rooms/lounge areas on each floor.

Is the building classified as "Residential", or is it considered "Nonresidential and More than 5 floors or > 150,000 sq. ft" due to the basement and main floor spaces not being "Residential"? Will I have to model the basement and the main floor separate from floors 2-9?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Cheers

D?nal

However.....
The notes in that table clarify as shown below.  I think the notes indicate that Donal's "predominant" building type is residential.  It sounds as though there are some "non-predominant" types as well.  Take a look at G3.1.1's Exceptions for a description of those.

I would classify it as Residential. It would seem strange to have a 
dormitory classified as non-residential. If the common areas qualify 
under G3.1.1 then they would be modeled as system type 3 or 4.

Per the exception noted by Mr Dirkes, I would model the Baseline building based on Table G3.1.1A; except with the dorm rooms, modeled them with System 1 or 2.

Here is how I come to this decision:


  *   Since your dormitory building contains some non-residential space types, you shouldn't use the building type to determine your Baseline, ie it's no longer truly a residential building type
  *   Dorm rooms still fall under the residential space type, so use residential Baseline systems (1 or 2) for those spaces
  *   "Other building and space types are considered nonresidential"  This statement allows the rest of the building to be modeled per standard baseline (area, # of floors, energy source).

I see the same thought process applies to the mixed-use (commercial/apartments) as well.  With the rise of mixed-use commercial building, I'm sure we'll be seeing this type of scenario more often.  I welcome any comments or suggestions.

Thanks,

D?nal,

Our team recently modeled a similar university dorm (Basement + Main floor with office spaces + four floors or residential units) for LEED 2009.

We determined that the Baseline should be based on "Residential" (as indicated by the note on Table G3.1.1A that says to use the predominant condition to determine the system type for the entire building) and used System 2 (electric-type heating in our Proposed case). For the common areas such as the office spaces in the first floor, you can use the same type of system (1 per zone) if they do not meet Exception G3.1.1a.

The LEED reviewers accepted our approach and we got our 8 points for that project EAc1.

Good luck,

Per the exception noted by Mr Dirkes, I would model the Baseline building based on Table G3.1.1A; except with the dorm rooms, modeled them with System 1 or 2.

Here is how I come to this decision:


 *   Since your dormitory building contains some non-residential space types, you shouldn't use the building type to determine your Baseline, ie it's no longer truly a residential building type
 *   Dorm rooms still fall under the residential space type, so use residential Baseline systems (1 or 2) for those spaces
 *   "Other building and space types are considered nonresidential"  This statement allows the rest of the building to be modeled per standard baseline (area, # of floors, energy source).

I see the same thought process applies to the mixed-use (commercial/apartments) as well.  With the rise of mixed-use commercial building, I'm sure we'll be seeing this type of scenario more often.  I welcome any comments or suggestions.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Definition of a University Dormitory - Residential or Non-Residential?

Dear Bldg Sim,

I'm looking for guidance on the definition of a University Dormitory building that I'm modeling under LEED 2009, particularly referencing Table G3.1.1A Baseline HVAC System Types. The building has 9 storeys above grade with an underground basement, with a total floor area of approx. 125,000 sq. ft.

The Basement is primarily crawlspace, electrical, mechanical, student storage etc.

The Main Floor consists of a number of multi-purpose rooms, further storage facilities for bicycles, recycling etc, with 1/3 of the main floor plan dedicated to student residences.

The remaining floors, 2 - 9, are student residences with a number of break out/study rooms/lounge areas on each floor.

Is the building classified as "Residential", or is it considered "Nonresidential and More than 5 floors or > 150,000 sq. ft" due to the basement and main floor spaces not being "Residential"? Will I have to model the basement and the main floor separate from floors 2-9?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Cheers

D?nal

Hi all,

Thank you for your responses thus far.

I did a quick calculation of the areas. Total Residential Floor area is approx. 75,000 sq. ft. and total Non-residential  is approx. 50,000 sq. ft. The Non-residential areas include the basement, main floor multi-purpose rooms, lobbies, storage etc, and the common corridors, elec, janitor, lounge/study areas on Floors 2-9.

So if we are in agreement that the Residential areas are to use either System 1 or System 2, the next question is what are the Non-residential areas classified as? From Table G3.1.1A it appears the number of floors take precedence over the floor area, so as the Non-residential area extends over 10 floors, it should be classified as System 7 or System 8. Am I correct in saying that the number of floors takes precedence over the floor area?

Thanks again for your help and guidance.

Cheers

Those are support spaces for the residential and can just be the same
system type, as that?s the predominant space type.  Anything else is
needlessly complicated.  The enclosed document is useful for establishing
modeling inputs for residential projects.

I second the approach described by Demba. Rut wrote ?Since your dormitory
building contains some non-residential space types, you shouldn't use the
building type to determine your Baseline, ie it's no longer truly a
residential building type?. I disagree that presence of spaces such as
electrical/mechanical rooms, corridors, stairs, multi-purpose rooms, etc.
automatically means that this is not a residential building type. It is hard
to imagine a dormitory, hotel, motel, or multifamily without these, and
System 7/8 is hardly an appropriate baseline for such spaces (there would
have to be a system modeled for each floor).  

You should also remember that only the area of conditioned spaces as defined
in 90.1 Section 3 is counted when determining baseline system type (G3.1.1),
so spaces like electrical/mechanical or storage may not have to be factored
in. 

Thanks,

Maria

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Definition of a University Dormitory - Residential or
Non-Residential?

 

Dear Bldg Sim,

I'm looking for guidance on the definition of a University Dormitory
building that I'm modeling under LEED 2009, particularly referencing Table
G3.1.1A Baseline HVAC System Types. The building has 9 storeys above grade
with an underground basement, with a total floor area of approx. 125,000 sq.
ft.

The Basement is primarily crawlspace, electrical, mechanical, student
storage etc.

The Main Floor consists of a number of multi-purpose rooms, further storage
facilities for bicycles, recycling etc, with 1/3 of the main floor plan
dedicated to student residences.

The remaining floors, 2 - 9, are student residences with a number of break
out/study rooms/lounge areas on each floor.

Is the building classified as "Residential", or is it considered
"Nonresidential and More than 5 floors or > 150,000 sq. ft" due to the
basement and main floor spaces not being "Residential"? Will I have to model
the basement and the main floor separate from floors 2-9?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Cheers

D?nal

From Table G3.1.1A it appears the number of floors take precedence over the floor area, so as the Non-residential area extends over 10 floors, it should be classified as System 7 or System 8.

Here is how I come to this decision:


 *   Since your dormitory building contains some non-residential space types, you shouldn't use the building type to determine your Baseline, ie it's no longer truly a residential building type
 *   Dorm rooms still fall under the residential space type, so use residential Baseline systems (1 or 2) for those spaces
 *   "Other building and space types are considered nonresidential"  This statement allows the rest of the building to be modeled per standard baseline (area, # of floors, energy source).

I see the same thought process applies to the mixed-use (commercial/apartments) as well.  With the rise of mixed-use commercial building, I'm sure we'll be seeing this type of scenario more often.  I welcome any comments or suggestions.

Yet another perspective is that when high-rise residential buildings are
modeled with Systems 7/8 serving common spaces on each floor, even very
modest proposed designs, such as minimally code compliant PTACs, often show
hefty savings compared to the baseline because many of the prescribed
Appendix G settings and controls misfire (e.g. 0.4 cfm/sf minimum setpoints
for VAV reheat in G3.1.3.13). This is an issue for incentive programs that
use Appendix G protocol, because they end up with some pretty ridiculous
ECMs that on paper qualify for incentives.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Definition of a University Dormitory - Residential or

Dear Bldg Sim,

I'm looking for guidance on the definition of a University Dormitory
building that I'm modeling under LEED 2009, particularly referencing Table
G3.1.1A Baseline HVAC System Types. The building has 9 storeys above grade
with an underground basement, with a total floor area of approx. 125,000 sq.
ft.

The Basement is primarily crawlspace, electrical, mechanical, student
storage etc.

The Main Floor consists of a number of multi-purpose rooms, further storage
facilities for bicycles, recycling etc, with 1/3 of the main floor plan
dedicated to student residences.

The remaining floors, 2 - 9, are student residences with a number of break
out/study rooms/lounge areas on each floor.

Is the building classified as "Residential", or is it considered
"Nonresidential and More than 5 floors or > 150,000 sq. ft" due to the
basement and main floor spaces not being "Residential"? Will I have to model
the basement and the main floor separate from floors 2-9?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Cheers

D?nal

Good morning, all,

 

Yes, dormitories are residential spaces (remember this also affects your
baseline building envelope requirements). In this instance since the
non-residential spaces total more than 20,000 square feet, an alternate HVAC
system type should be selected for the predominant condition. Depending on
the operating schedules, internal loads, etc. (the other exceptions to
Section G3.1.1) using a third system type may be appropriate (type 3 or 4).
Whether it is appropriate to count the common areas on the residential
floors to determine the system type for the non-predominant condition could
be argued either way. Before proceeding either way, I would suggest looking
for any LEED Interpretations since the reviewer is likely to hold you to
previously published interpretations. I also believe mixed-use residential
projects are discussed in the Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED 2009 (free
to registered projects and available in LEED online under the credit
resources tab).

 

Hope this helps!

Yet another perspective is that when high-rise residential buildings are
modeled with Systems 7/8 serving common spaces on each floor, even very
modest proposed designs, such as minimally code compliant PTACs, often show
hefty savings compared to the baseline because many of the prescribed
Appendix G settings and controls misfire (e.g. 0.4 cfm/sf minimum setpoints
for VAV reheat in G3.1.3.13). This is an issue for incentive programs that
use Appendix G protocol, because they end up with some pretty ridiculous
ECMs that on paper qualify for incentives.

I second the approach described by Demba. Rut wrote ?Since your dormitory
building contains some non-residential space types, you shouldn't use the
building type to determine your Baseline, ie it's no longer truly a
residential building type?. I disagree that presence of spaces such as
electrical/mechanical rooms, corridors, stairs, multi-purpose rooms, etc.
automatically means that this is not a residential building type. It is hard
to imagine a dormitory, hotel, motel, or multifamily without these, and
System 7/8 is hardly an appropriate baseline for such spaces (there would
have to be a system modeled for each floor).  

You should also remember that only the area of conditioned spaces as defined
in 90.1 Section 3 is counted when determining baseline system type (G3.1.1),
so spaces like electrical/mechanical or storage may not have to be factored
in. 

Thanks,

Maria

Hi all,

Thank you for your responses thus far.

I did a quick calculation of the areas. Total Residential Floor area is
approx. 75,000 sq. ft. and total Non-residential  is approx. 50,000 sq. ft.
The Non-residential areas include the basement, main floor multi-purpose
rooms, lobbies, storage etc, and the common corridors, elec, janitor,
lounge/study areas on Floors 2-9.

So if we are in agreement that the Residential areas are to use either
System 1 or System 2, the next question is what are the Non-residential
areas classified as? From Table G3.1.1A it appears the number of floors take
precedence over the floor area, so as the Non-residential area extends over
10 floors, it should be classified as System 7 or System 8. Am I correct in
saying that the number of floors takes precedence over the floor area?

Thanks again for your help and guidance.

Cheers

D?nal

Per the exception noted by Mr Dirkes, I would model the Baseline building
based on Table G3.1.1A; except with the dorm rooms, modeled them with System
1 or 2. 

 

Here is how I come to this decision:

 

*	Since your dormitory building contains some non-residential space
types, you shouldn't use the building type to determine your Baseline, ie
it's no longer truly a residential building type
*	Dorm rooms still fall under the residential space type, so use
residential Baseline systems (1 or 2) for those spaces
*	"Other building and space types are considered nonresidential"  This
statement allows the rest of the building to be modeled per standard
baseline (area, # of floors, energy source).

 

I see the same thought process applies to the mixed-use
(commercial/apartments) as well.  With the rise of mixed-use commercial
building, I'm sure we'll be seeing this type of scenario more often.  I
welcome any comments or suggestions.

 

Thanks,

 

Rut Wattanasak

Hi Cam,

I agree with the others that the "non-residential" areas such as common corridors, janitor, elec rooms etc on Floors 2-9 are there to support the residential areas and therefore should be classified as "residential". The "non-residential" areas on the main floor and the basement total approx. 19,000 sq. ft. which is under the 20,000 sq. ft. threshold specified in G3.1.1 Exception (a), so I will specify all areas as "residential" and assign to System 1/2.

Thanks again for all of your responses.

Hi D?nal,

 

The public spaces (common corridors, lounges, and utility spaces) on the
residential floors are classified as non-residential and must be modeled
with a non-residential system type if the total area for these spaces is
more than 20,000 square feet. You can try another approach, but it is likely
that the reviewer will require you to change the model if you use
residential systems in the public spaces.

Hi Cam,

I agree with the others that the "non-residential" areas such as common
corridors, janitor, elec rooms etc on Floors 2-9 are there to support the
residential areas and therefore should be classified as "residential". The
"non-residential" areas on the main floor and the basement total approx.
19,000 sq. ft. which is under the 20,000 sq. ft. threshold specified in
G3.1.1 Exception (a), so I will specify all areas as "residential" and
assign to System 1/2.

Thanks again for all of your responses.

Cheers

D?nal

Good morning, all,

 

Yes, dormitories are residential spaces (remember this also affects your
baseline building envelope requirements). In this instance since the
non-residential spaces total more than 20,000 square feet, an alternate HVAC
system type should be selected for the predominant condition. Depending on
the operating schedules, internal loads, etc. (the other exceptions to
Section G3.1.1) using a third system type may be appropriate (type 3 or 4).
Whether it is appropriate to count the common areas on the residential
floors to determine the system type for the non-predominant condition could
be argued either way. Before proceeding either way, I would suggest looking
for any LEED Interpretations since the reviewer is likely to hold you to
previously published interpretations. I also believe mixed-use residential
projects are discussed in the Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED 2009 (free
to registered projects and available in LEED online under the credit
resources tab).

 

Hope this helps!

Yet another perspective is that when high-rise residential buildings are
modeled with Systems 7/8 serving common spaces on each floor, even very
modest proposed designs, such as minimally code compliant PTACs, often show
hefty savings compared to the baseline because many of the prescribed
Appendix G settings and controls misfire (e.g. 0.4 cfm/sf minimum setpoints
for VAV reheat in G3.1.3.13). This is an issue for incentive programs that
use Appendix G protocol, because they end up with some pretty ridiculous
ECMs that on paper qualify for incentives.

I second the approach described by Demba. Rut wrote ?Since your dormitory
building contains some non-residential space types, you shouldn't use the
building type to determine your Baseline, ie it's no longer truly a
residential building type?. I disagree that presence of spaces such as
electrical/mechanical rooms, corridors, stairs, multi-purpose rooms, etc.
automatically means that this is not a residential building type. It is hard
to imagine a dormitory, hotel, motel, or multifamily without these, and
System 7/8 is hardly an appropriate baseline for such spaces (there would
have to be a system modeled for each floor).  

You should also remember that only the area of conditioned spaces as defined
in 90.1 Section 3 is counted when determining baseline system type (G3.1.1),
so spaces like electrical/mechanical or storage may not have to be factored
in. 

Thanks,

Maria

Hi all,

Thank you for your responses thus far.

I did a quick calculation of the areas. Total Residential Floor area is
approx. 75,000 sq. ft. and total Non-residential  is approx. 50,000 sq. ft.
The Non-residential areas include the basement, main floor multi-purpose
rooms, lobbies, storage etc, and the common corridors, elec, janitor,
lounge/study areas on Floors 2-9.

So if we are in agreement that the Residential areas are to use either
System 1 or System 2, the next question is what are the Non-residential
areas classified as? From Table G3.1.1A it appears the number of floors take
precedence over the floor area, so as the Non-residential area extends over
10 floors, it should be classified as System 7 or System 8. Am I correct in
saying that the number of floors takes precedence over the floor area?

Thanks again for your help and guidance.

Cheers

D?nal

Per the exception noted by Mr Dirkes, I would model the Baseline building
based on Table G3.1.1A; except with the dorm rooms, modeled them with System
1 or 2. 

 

Here is how I come to this decision:

 

*	Since your dormitory building contains some non-residential space
types, you shouldn't use the building type to determine your Baseline, ie
it's no longer truly a residential building type
*	Dorm rooms still fall under the residential space type, so use
residential Baseline systems (1 or 2) for those spaces
*	"Other building and space types are considered nonresidential"  This
statement allows the rest of the building to be modeled per standard
baseline (area, # of floors, energy source).

 

I see the same thought process applies to the mixed-use
(commercial/apartments) as well.  With the rise of mixed-use commercial
building, I'm sure we'll be seeing this type of scenario more often.  I
welcome any comments or suggestions.

 

Thanks,

However
..

The notes in that table clarify as shown below.  I think the notes indicate
that Donal?s ?predominant? building type is residential.  It sounds as
though there are some ?non-predominant? types as well.  Take a look at
G3.1.1?s Exceptions for a description of those.

 

>From 90.1-2007 Table G3.1.1A:

Residential building types include dormitory, hotel, motel, and multifamily.

Dear Bldg Sim,

I'm looking for guidance on the definition of a University Dormitory
building that I'm modeling under LEED 2009, particularly referencing Table
G3.1.1A Baseline HVAC System Types. The building has 9 storeys above grade
with an underground basement, with a total floor area of approx. 125,000 sq.
ft.

The Basement is primarily crawlspace, electrical, mechanical, student
storage etc.

The Main Floor consists of a number of multi-purpose rooms, further storage
facilities for bicycles, recycling etc, with 1/3 of the main floor plan
dedicated to student residences.

The remaining floors, 2 - 9, are student residences with a number of break
out/study rooms/lounge areas on each floor.

Is the building classified as "Residential", or is it considered
"Nonresidential and More than 5 floors or > 150,000 sq. ft" due to the
basement and main floor spaces not being "Residential"? Will I have to model
the basement and the main floor separate from floors 2-9?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Cheers

D?nal

Dear fellow Canadian energy modellers.

We are involved with the energy modeling of a residential glass tower which aims at a LEED Canada-NC certification.

The building envelope is mostly curtain walls with limited amounts of opaque components (spandrel panels among them). When running the model, EE4 gives us an error message saying the building doesn't meet the mandatory requirement 8.2.1.4.(2), which means that the proposed building opaque envelope components (walls and roofs) have an overall U-value higher than 167% of the reference building overall U-value.

Normally, not meeting a mandatory requirement means the building cannot be certified for LEED Canada.

We are trying to find if the CaGBC has generally been lenient about this requirement or not..? I can't find a CIR, or other source / example saying so.

Of course, among the ways around would be to design and model the building against ASHRAE 90.1... but that would means checking against a whole new set of mandatory prescriptions, and completely reworking the energy model. Which we are trying to avoid.

Another way is to remove all offending spandrel panels and replacing them with regular glass component. Not sure how the architect will take this.

Any input / help on this is appreciated.

Hello group,

I have a datacenter room with 2 air conditioner, one for normal use and the
other one for backup if the first one fails.

Do I need to describe this backup airconditioner in the Table 1.4 of Leed?
I guess I don't need to, but I haven't found it in any documentation nor a

Have any of you come across this situation before?

Any suggestion would much appreciated.

 Reset in ASHRAE 90.1-2007
Message-ID: <89B4FB2D5DE7614EB31CD320ED524958CD324D09B0@TOR-SVR-EX5.mcw.com>

Hello,

I am doing an ASHRAE 90.1-2007 PRM analysis for a LEED 2009 CS project, credit EAc1. The baseline system is System 7 - VAV with Reheat.

Appendix G has the following requirements for System 7:
[cid:image003.jpg at 01CE36DF.AC800100]

In keeping with the above requirements, when the temperature is satisfied in any zone, I am supplying 0.4 cfm/ft2 at 59F (54F + 5F reset). This is causing many zones to be overcooled and, therefore, reheated. The result is that I have a significant amount of simultaneous heating and cooling in my baseline model. Section 6.5.2.1 states that reheating, recooling and simultaneous heating/cooling is not allowed unless the air volume is no greater than 0.4 cfm/ft2 (or the larger of 0.4 cfm/ft2, the ventilation requirement, 30% of max flow, etc.). Therefore, my baseline is allowed to overcool and reheat since it is running at 0.4 cfm/ft2.

My proposed model does not have this problem as it is allowed to go below 0.4 cfm/ft2 and it is allowed to reset by more than 5F. I am achieving unreasonably high savings as a result of this issue.

What I find interesting is that G3.1.3.13 has been revised for ASHRAE 90.1-2010 to the following:
[cid:image004.jpg at 01CE36DF.AC800100]

The minimum is no longer an absolute 0.4 cfm/ft2 but a relative 30% of zone peak air flow. In mild or heating dominated climates 30% of zone peak air flow can be much less than 0.4 cfm/ft2.

By changing the requirement for 90.1-2010 is this an acknowledgement by ASHRAE that the previous requirement could lead to an inefficient baseline model? Am I justified in exploiting it to achieve high savings?

Thank you!

Frederic,

This must be a very tall tower if the roof can't carry the entire envelope over the requirement. It does sounds like your options are to either beef up the roof insulation or add more glass (which admittedly sounds silly, but is compliant).

This must be a very tall tower if the roof can't carry the entire envelope over the requirement. It does sounds like your options are to either beef up the roof insulation or add more glass (which admittedly sounds silly, but is compliant).

Cam,

 

I believe that common spaces such as corridors, stairs, etc. should be
treated as residential when they are in buildings that fall under
residential building type as defined in the first note below Table G3.1.1A.
Also, based on Table G3.1#3 Space Use Classification, ? Usage shall be
specified using the building type or space type lighting classifications in
accordance with Section 9.5.1 or 9.6.1.? Table 9.5.1 has Multifamily
building type, which includes corridors, stairs, etc. (Note that G3.1.#3 is
otherwise not related to lighting.)

 

Another argument in favor of my interpretation is the example in 90.1 User
Manual for Sections 11 and Appendix G. It involves a mixed use building with
residential and non-residential floors (see screenshot below), and sets
System 1 (PTACs) as the baseline for residential floors, and System 5 (PVAV)
as the baseline for non-residential floors. If corridors on residential
floors were combined with non-residential floors below for the purpose of
determining baseline HVAC, we?d end up with more than 5 stories of
non-residential space, which would give us System 7 and not System 5. 

 



 

Thanks,

 

Maria

Hi D?nal,

 

The public spaces (common corridors, lounges, and utility spaces) on the
residential floors are classified as non-residential and must be modeled
with a non-residential system type if the total area for these spaces is
more than 20,000 square feet. You can try another approach, but it is likely
that the reviewer will require you to change the model if you use
residential systems in the public spaces.

Hi Cam,

I agree with the others that the "non-residential" areas such as common
corridors, janitor, elec rooms etc on Floors 2-9 are there to support the
residential areas and therefore should be classified as "residential". The
"non-residential" areas on the main floor and the basement total approx.
19,000 sq. ft. which is under the 20,000 sq. ft. threshold specified in
G3.1.1 Exception (a), so I will specify all areas as "residential" and
assign to System 1/2.

Thanks again for all of your responses.

Cheers

D?nal

Good morning, all,

 

Yes, dormitories are residential spaces (remember this also affects your
baseline building envelope requirements). In this instance since the
non-residential spaces total more than 20,000 square feet, an alternate HVAC
system type should be selected for the predominant condition. Depending on
the operating schedules, internal loads, etc. (the other exceptions to
Section G3.1.1) using a third system type may be appropriate (type 3 or 4).
Whether it is appropriate to count the common areas on the residential
floors to determine the system type for the non-predominant condition could
be argued either way. Before proceeding either way, I would suggest looking
for any LEED Interpretations since the reviewer is likely to hold you to
previously published interpretations. I also believe mixed-use residential
projects are discussed in the Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED 2009 (free
to registered projects and available in LEED online under the credit
resources tab).

 

Hope this helps!

Yet another perspective is that when high-rise residential buildings are
modeled with Systems 7/8 serving common spaces on each floor, even very
modest proposed designs, such as minimally code compliant PTACs, often show
hefty savings compared to the baseline because many of the prescribed
Appendix G settings and controls misfire (e.g. 0.4 cfm/sf minimum setpoints
for VAV reheat in G3.1.3.13). This is an issue for incentive programs that
use Appendix G protocol, because they end up with some pretty ridiculous
ECMs that on paper qualify for incentives.

I second the approach described by Demba. Rut wrote ?Since your dormitory
building contains some non-residential space types, you shouldn't use the
building type to determine your Baseline, ie it's no longer truly a
residential building type?. I disagree that presence of spaces such as
electrical/mechanical rooms, corridors, stairs, multi-purpose rooms, etc.
automatically means that this is not a residential building type. It is hard
to imagine a dormitory, hotel, motel, or multifamily without these, and
System 7/8 is hardly an appropriate baseline for such spaces (there would
have to be a system modeled for each floor).  

You should also remember that only the area of conditioned spaces as defined
in 90.1 Section 3 is counted when determining baseline system type (G3.1.1),
so spaces like electrical/mechanical or storage may not have to be factored
in. 

Thanks,

Maria

Hi all,

Thank you for your responses thus far.

I did a quick calculation of the areas. Total Residential Floor area is
approx. 75,000 sq. ft. and total Non-residential  is approx. 50,000 sq. ft.
The Non-residential areas include the basement, main floor multi-purpose
rooms, lobbies, storage etc, and the common corridors, elec, janitor,
lounge/study areas on Floors 2-9.

So if we are in agreement that the Residential areas are to use either
System 1 or System 2, the next question is what are the Non-residential
areas classified as? From Table G3.1.1A it appears the number of floors take
precedence over the floor area, so as the Non-residential area extends over
10 floors, it should be classified as System 7 or System 8. Am I correct in
saying that the number of floors takes precedence over the floor area?

Thanks again for your help and guidance.

Cheers

D?nal

Per the exception noted by Mr Dirkes, I would model the Baseline building
based on Table G3.1.1A; except with the dorm rooms, modeled them with System
1 or 2. 

 

Here is how I come to this decision:

 

*	Since your dormitory building contains some non-residential space
types, you shouldn't use the building type to determine your Baseline, ie
it's no longer truly a residential building type
*	Dorm rooms still fall under the residential space type, so use
residential Baseline systems (1 or 2) for those spaces
*	"Other building and space types are considered nonresidential"  This
statement allows the rest of the building to be modeled per standard
baseline (area, # of floors, energy source).

 

I see the same thought process applies to the mixed-use
(commercial/apartments) as well.  With the rise of mixed-use commercial
building, I'm sure we'll be seeing this type of scenario more often.  I
welcome any comments or suggestions.

 

Thanks,

However
..

The notes in that table clarify as shown below.  I think the notes indicate
that Donal?s ?predominant? building type is residential.  It sounds as
though there are some ?non-predominant? types as well.  Take a look at
G3.1.1?s Exceptions for a description of those.

 

>From 90.1-2007 Table G3.1.1A:

Notes:

Residential building types include dormitory, hotel, motel, and multifamily.
Residential space types include guest rooms, living quarters, private living
space, and sleeping quarters. Other

building and space types are considered nonresidential

Dear Bldg Sim,

I'm looking for guidance on the definition of a University Dormitory
building that I'm modeling under LEED 2009, particularly referencing Table
G3.1.1A Baseline HVAC System Types. The building has 9 storeys above grade
with an underground basement, with a total floor area of approx. 125,000 sq.
ft.

The Basement is primarily crawlspace, electrical, mechanical, student
storage etc.

The Main Floor consists of a number of multi-purpose rooms, further storage
facilities for bicycles, recycling etc, with 1/3 of the main floor plan
dedicated to student residences.

The remaining floors, 2 - 9, are student residences with a number of break
out/study rooms/lounge areas on each floor.

Is the building classified as "Residential", or is it considered
"Nonresidential and More than 5 floors or > 150,000 sq. ft" due to the
basement and main floor spaces not being "Residential"? Will I have to model
the basement and the main floor separate from floors 2-9?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Cheers

D?nal

Dear colleagues,

Over the next two decades, the UN expects that we need to accommodate new homes for 1.7 billion city dwellers. There is an undeniable need for concepts and solutions that lead to more sustainable urban growth, concepts that work across a range of climates and cultures. What are those solutions? Are there good examples? How can we evaluate them on a large scale? What role can computer based environmental performance analysis play in this context?

It is my pleasure to invite you to an all-day symposium on Sustainable Urban Design - Case Studies and Design Workflows<http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/projects/SustainableUrbanDesignSymposium> on May 6th 2013 at MIT. The symposium is supported by the MIT Energy Initiative, MIT's new Center for Advanced Urbanism and the German American Chamber of Commerce Inc. During the morning session speakers from practice and academia will present examples and workflows of how to implement measures of sustainability in their projects. During the afternoon session we will be presenting Umi<http://urbanmodellinginterface.ning.com/>, our new urban modeling platform to evaluate operational energy use, daylighting, outdoor comfort and walkability at the neighborhood level. Umi has been extensively used in two graduate level classes at MIT and Harvard and student projects resulting from these classes will be presented in a poster sessions in the late afternoon. During the closing discussion we hope to develop a better understanding of the role computational design tools may play in the transition to more sustainable urban planning practices.

If you decide to attend, please RSVP<http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/projects/SustainableUrbanDesignSymposium/rsvp.html> by April 15th.

Best regards,

Christoph

Varkie,

I'm not sure what you mean about "EnergyPlus Weather", since EPW is just 
a file format that is not specific to weather data themselves.  TMY3 is 
a type of weather data and released in a CSV format, but it can also be 
converted to TMY2, EPW, BIN, etc.   The EnergyPlus Weather web site 
contains a lot of files from various sources that's all been converted 
to EPW.   There's probably a weather file for Singapore there, but I 
haven't bothered to check.  There's plenty of weather data for Singapore 
done by people there or others, such as ASHRAE  IWEC and IWEC2.
E-mail me if you still need help.

My two cents.

 

1)      Is the change an admission that the previous requirement could
lead to an inefficient baseline system? Yes. 

2)      Are you justified in "exploiting" it to achieve high energy
savings? Yes. 

 

These are the rules of the game. Sometimes they benefit the baseline
system, sometimes they benefit the proposed system. 

 

If that doesn't make you feel comfortable, you could always see if there
was a specific addendum to 90.1-2007 where that change was made and
"elect" to apply that addendum in its entirety to your model.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] VAV Minimum Flow Setpoint and Supply Air Temperature
Reset in ASHRAE 90.1-2007

 

Hello,

 

I am doing an ASHRAE 90.1-2007 PRM analysis for a LEED 2009 CS project,
credit EAc1. The baseline system is System 7 - VAV with Reheat.

 

Appendix G has the following requirements for System 7:



 

In keeping with the above requirements, when the temperature is satisfied
in any zone, I am supplying 0.4 cfm/ft2 at 59F (54F + 5F reset). This is
causing many zones to be overcooled and, therefore, reheated. The result
is that I have a significant amount of simultaneous heating and cooling in
my baseline model. Section 6.5.2.1 states that reheating, recooling and
simultaneous heating/cooling is not allowed unless the air volume is no
greater than 0.4 cfm/ft2 (or the larger of 0.4 cfm/ft2, the ventilation
requirement, 30% of max flow, etc.). Therefore, my baseline is allowed to
overcool and reheat since it is running at 0.4 cfm/ft2.

 

My proposed model does not have this problem as it is allowed to go below
0.4 cfm/ft2 and it is allowed to reset by more than 5F. I am achieving
unreasonably high savings as a result of this issue.

 

What I find interesting is that G3.1.3.13 has been revised for ASHRAE
90.1-2010 to the following:



 

The minimum is no longer an absolute 0.4 cfm/ft2 but a relative 30% of
zone peak air flow. In mild or heating dominated climates 30% of zone peak
air flow can be much less than 0.4 cfm/ft2.

 

By changing the requirement for 90.1-2010 is this an acknowledgement by
ASHRAE that the previous requirement could lead to an inefficient baseline
model? Am I justified in exploiting it to achieve high savings?

 

Thank you!

Hi Maria,
The predominant condition is determined only by conditioned area not gross
floor area.I feel the common spaces such as corridors,stairs etc should be
considered as residential or non-residential depending space type/floor it
serves.If these common spaces such as corridors,stairs etc are
unconditioned then no problem it doesn't affect the baseline system
selection.
Baseline System Selection:
 If the conditioned area of both residential and non-residential space is
greater than 20,000sf then the project is eligible for G3.1.1 exceptions
a.Otherwise if either of the space type conditioned area is less than
20,000sf system selection is based on predominant conditioned area.

Cheers,
Dhayanandh

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How to model a district ice-storage system using option2?
Message-ID: <7d6b1788.9016.13e0cb35a91.Coremail.e2fye2@163.com>

Dear modelers,
I'm simulating several buildings using district cooling for LEED certificate. The district cooling plants are ice-storage plants.
The "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2 and LEED 2009 ? Design & Construction" specify that a virtual plant should be used to represent the district cooling plants performance. However, general virtual plant operate in day time, which cannot reflect the advantage of ice-storage system. 
I have two questions about it.
1 If the default efficiency of chiller is used in the virtual cooling plant, shall I also construct an ice-storage system in the proposed case? I did this in the first submission, and the reviewer did not reject it. I wonder if it is acceptable, because no guidance is given in the "Treatment V2" of this condition.
2 Appendix C of the "Treatment V2" said that if the efficiency of the district plant would like to be input as it is, the efficiency of the district cooling plants should be modeled or monitored. If modeling method is used, I really question how this should be carried out. How the load is determined or modeled? How the ice-storage performance of the virtual plant be identical with the district plants?
Thanks for your suggestions!
Esmi

Message-ID: <5981a70d.10c6b.13e10882f1d.Coremail.e2fye2@163.com>

Dear all,
When simulating district cooling for LEED, a virtual plant is required to be added to the proposed building, according to the "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2 and LEED 2009 ? Design & Construction".
The efficiency of the virtual plant is obtained through modeling if the district cooling system is new.
The "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2 and LEED 2009 ? Design & Construction" said, "Apply measured or estimated load profiles as ?process loads? to reflect the estimated total loads on the district energy plant".
My question is:
What is the estimated load? If the district cooling system provides cold to any other buildings that are not in the LEED certificate scope, how can I get the estimated load? 

Regards,
Esmi

First off, I have no idea...

But I would start with the load profile of a building representative of 
the median or average age of the buildings on the system, even if I had 
to build the model.  Then I would apply that to the central plant, 
scaled up to the capacity of the central plant, or where you think the 
capacity factor falls.  If I was doing this in Energy Pro, which I use 
most often, I might build a "typical" model building and add it to the 
model of the proposed building (all being heated and cooled by the 
central plant), with an appropriate multiplier to use up the capacity of 
the central plant, minus the new proposed building, on a design day.  I 
would then consider leaving those "bogey buildings" in the model as I 
proceeded forward.  Perhaps (just perhaps) calling them "existing" might 
allow the software to ignore them for the LEED calculations.

You could also find out what other buildings are on the system, and 
model those.  Probably more accurate than just a "typical building".  If 
you modeled all the buildings being provided heating and cooling by the 
central plant, that would be a pretty good way to go.


But, like I said, I have no idea.

Dear all,
In the eQuest output file, can we know the produced cold or heat?
I would like to calculate the comprehensive efficency of the cooling system. The power consumption of the cooling system, including chiller, pumps etc., is easy to get. But the generated cold of the cooling system cannot be found. 
I tried to use the total cooling energy in ?PS-A Plant energy utilization?, or cooling energy sum in "SS-D Building HVAC load summary", but the they are not equal to each other.
Can anybody give some light on it?
Thanks!

According to the DOE-2.1E manual, page C.131, the TOTAL COOLING LOAD in the PS-A report is 
"the total of the values shown in the SS-D report plus tank and circulation loop losses; 
it represents the cooling energy needed each month".

Dear all,
I wonder how to set the COP of a chiller as constant? after I set the chiller type, the electric input ratio type is determined, which means the self-made constant curve cannot be input.
Thanks!

I would agree with that.

I would recommend informing your client that you can either do Option 1 of the USGBC DESv2.0 guidelines (i.e. plants modeled as neutral between baseline and proposed via stipulated rates), or using the stipulated efficiencies for Option 2.

Otherwise, I would recommend informing your client that modeling the entire district system just to estimate the plant efficiencies (i.e. includes buildings outside the scope of the current project), with the goal of getting more EAc1 points for the project, will result in you asking for additional fee because this is additional work on your part, potentially a lot of additional work.  I think this is a very reasonable approach.

Esmireta,

It has been awhile since I modeled a central plant for a LEED project, so you'll have to verify my comments.

After applying a CHW meter and a Steam Meter to your CHW Loop and HW Loop respectively, a new Central Plant can be modeled in either of the following ways:


1)    Using efficiencies per section 2.4.1.2.3 Default Efficiencies and applying them to your meters, or

2)    Using efficiencies per the design specifications and applying them to your meters.

I don't remember ever seeing a 'process load' that must be applied to the plant. I'm sure some else will chime in a correct me if I'm wrong. Have a great day!

Thanks,

Subject: [Equest-users] How the get the "estimated load profile"?

Dear all,
When simulating district cooling for LEED, a virtual plant is required to be added to the proposed building, according to the "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2 and LEED 2009 - Design & Construction".
The efficiency of the virtual plant is obtained through modeling if the district cooling system is new.
The "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2 and LEED 2009 - Design & Construction" said, "Apply measured or estimated load profiles as "process loads" to reflect the estimated total loads on the district energy plant".
My question is:
What is the estimated load? If the district cooling system provides cold to any other buildings that are not in the LEED certificate scope, how can I get the estimated load?
Regards,
Esmi

 peak time and off peak time in eQuest?
Message-ID: <3fda3642.788d.13e16c7318b.Coremail.e2fye2@163.com>

Dear all,
In a district cooling using ice-storage project, the baseline building is required to meter energy consumption separately in peak time and off peak time, as the proposed building.
In the proposed case, I use a virtual chiller to produce ice during off peak time, thus, it is easy to meter the peak energy consumption and off peak consumption by set different elec. meters on different chillers.
Now the baseline is also required to meter the energy consumption separately. I wonder if there is any method to directly meter the energy consumption during different time for ONE chiller.
Thanks!

Message-ID: <CAOyQK8YaT=zHr688SEmJu6GMYKfTb57M6h-2nmP_dTF6PDEnuw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on a project that involves an expansion and a major renovation
of an existing building. My question relates to LEED modeling of the
existing building under LEED-NC.

The issue is that the existing building is significantly over-ventilated.
My team is involved in an energy retrofit of the existing structure and
intends to bring the OA rate down significantly. However because of the
equal vent rate requirement in Appendix-G, it seems like this won't lead to
any energy credit. As I understand it, no matter what we drop the vent rate
to (or even if we raised it), the proposed building will have to match and
the ventilation improvement will go unrecognized.

In case that's not clear, say the current building has 10,000 cfm of OA,
but we're going to drop that to 5,000 cfm with the new design.  This leads
to significant heating and cooling savings. Can the baseline have 10,000
cfm because it's an existing building, or must it match under all
circumstances?

Not unrecognized, the owner will save lots of energy which should be recognized.

They should do that part regardless of LEED.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How to set the loop loss as 5 or 10%?
Message-ID: <7fda0ac9.32ef.13e1ae2bbe9.Coremail.e2fye2@163.com>

Dear all,
As required by the district thermal energy guidance, the loop loss should be 5% for the cooling loop and 10% for the heating loop.
However, there is only DT input for the loop loss option panel. If the supply and return temperature difference is 40 F for the heating loop, the loss should be 4 F. But after I set the loss DT as 4F, the heating energy consumption will increase heavily, even 3 times of the orginal heating energy consumption.
So I wonder how it works. Does anybody have experience on it?
Thanks!

Hi Mitchell,
Thanks for your reply!
I really don't know how the DT work. Why a little DT can give a huge rise in the energy consumption?
Further, will the GBCI reviewer question the way of setting DT to represent the loop loss? Did you give any specific explanation on the DT, or just leave it without narrative?
Thanks!
Esmi

If your client actually meters the chilled water usage at the buildings and
allocates the charges to each facility for the cost of producing chilled
water you can use that information and just set the model up in baseline
and proposed building like any other metered utility with a cost per btu,
Kbtu, ton-hours, etc. There would be no need to model a central plant at
all in this case.
I believe the rule is that the proposed building has to be less than 50% of
the load on the central plant. You would need to verify that in the LEED
documentation.

My experience has been that the ventilation rates do have to match between
models when it comes to LEED.

 

The rule is a bit short-sighted because, in reality, there are potentials
for energy savings from reduced OA just based on system type. For example, a
DOAS will have lower total OA than a typical VAV system. My initial
submission of a project using this argument was rejected, though, because
the OA values did not match between the two models.

if you're using dcv in the proposed model the ventilation rates are 
allowed to be different if the dcv use is not required by section 
6.4.3.8, but if you're not using dcv the oa rates are to be the same.  
reference exception in g3.1.2.5.

Esmireta,

I've always provided a narrative to support this. The last two campus projects I've dealt with directly had two different resolutions.

1.       Project A: Modeled the virtual plant based on the equipment efficiencies following the District Thermal Modeling Guidelines. In this case, the heat loss from the campus piping distribution was assigned as a delta-T as loss to the tunnel. A narrative was provided to explain the total CHW & Steam consumption before adding the heat loss, and the consumption after applying the heat loss. I assume similar parameters, as you describe, by multiply the distribution DT by 10% for the tunnel losses - however, the results were much greater than a 5% or 10% increase in energy use for that component. I reviewed the summary of plant equipment reports and found the part load performance was completely different from the model without a DT factor applied. It appeared as though the plant was trying to accommodate for these loads so the equipment DT's were operating at higher ranges, thus changing factors for exiting CHW temperature and the LIFT. I didn't have much more time than to dig deeper, but adjust the DT down until the 5%/10% thresholds were achieved and explained this to the reviewer.

2.       Project B: Ended up using actual metered consumption of the CUP/CHP to build a spreadsheet of the total energy consumed for BTUs delivered. I was trying to model this approach, but it got very convoluted, and ultimately had a review with the GBCI review team and Gail Hampsmire from the GBCI. This was very productive and helped us forge ahead with a simple resolution of using a spreadsheet based calculation apportioning the real campus energy use meters to prorate kWh/therms for each building. Bottom line is if you are having a difficult time communicating with the review team, see about having a short call with Gail to help work through open issues and determine a path forward. She's been incredibly helpful for multiple items we've encountered.

Hi Mitchell,
Thanks for your reply!
I really don't know how the DT work. Why a little DT can give a huge rise in the energy consumption?
Further, will the GBCI reviewer question the way of setting DT to represent the loop loss? Did you give any specific explanation on the DT, or just leave it without narrative?
Thanks!
Esmi

Dear all,
As required by the district thermal energy guidance, the loop loss should be 5% for the cooling loop and 10% for the heating loop.
However, there is only DT input for the loop loss option panel. If the supply and return temperature difference is 40 F for the heating loop, the loss should be 4 F. But after I set the loss DT as 4F, the heating energy consumption will increase heavily, even 3 times of the orginal heating energy consumption.
So I wonder how it works. Does anybody have experience on it?
Thanks!
Esmi

Hi,

 

Should Multiple Zone systems in the MNECB Reference building have Supply Air
Temperature reset?  

 

I?ve always used it because I know EE4 has the cooling coil reset for
reference buildings in DOE2.1E (COOL-CONTROL = WARMEST).  

 

The reason I ask is because Table 5.4.1.B of the MNECB Performance
Compliance for Buildings says ?Supply air temperature from secondary system
to terminal units is constant at 13?C (55?F).? for Multiple Zone Systems.
The sentence still exists in the 2011 NECB.

 

Thanks,

Aaron

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Insulate the roof in summer without HVAC system yes or
	no?
Message-ID: <95F0356A0810C44AB56ADD48FA44184101DF23F3@greengo>

Hi all

 

I have a project where I need to model a maintenance hangar,

 

In this project we are evaluating the relevance of insulate the roof to
improve the comfort level in summer. The hangar has no air conditioned
system but we use natural ventilation which seems to work well in our
model (we use IES VE).

 

The problem came when we try to put some insulating material to the
actual roof (which is composed of only metal sheet of 2 cms). Unlike one
might expect the temperature in the hangar increases, as the roof
temperature.

 

This is to some extent logic, and I know it depends of the insulate type
and thickness. But we agree (I think) that at least one insulation with
les of 2cm to the actual roof should give an improvement in at least
roof or air temperature. I know that insulation can serve as a "trap" of
interior thermal conditions, so it's improve HVAC systems performance.
But also it serves to avoid the external conditions gets-in.

 

I have tried several configurations without success, internal, external
insulation. 

 

And maybe some of you have already some experience in model this kind of
configuration. We agree (I think) that I can't recommend to my architect
that he shouldn't insulate its roof, but also I want to explain the
pertinence of this with a dynamic thermal modeling.

 

Thanks in advance for any advice on this,

 

David Garcia

Dear community,

I?ve just finished some LEED Energy Modelling for a building in Sao Paulo and I came across some results that made me a bit sceptical. I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on the matter.

Description of the model:

Our proposed building has 30% less Energy Demand than the Baseline building.
The proposed building uses a fan coil system with minimum fresh air provision. The baseline model utilises a PFP VAV system (no.8 according to ASHRAE classification).
Fresh air flow rates between Baseline and Proposed buildings are the same ? i.e. around 7.5l/s/p.
Both Buildings have heat recovery and similar SFPs.
The proposed building uses a rather mediocre Air Cooled chiller ? COP of 2.8 -  whilst the baseline building uses a highly efficient Water Cooled Chiller ? COP of 5.5.

The problem:

The proposed building?s auxiliary energy Consumption is around 80kWh/m2, whilst the Baseline?s  auxiliary  energy consumption is  around 400kWh/m2 ? i.e. 500% more. Does this sound normal? What kind of auxiliary energy consumption (kWh/m2) is reasonable for a VAV system with PFPs doing 7.5l/s/p fresh air? Of course there will be some recirculation from the economiser, but can this justify 5 times more energy spend on auxiliary?

Regards
Ioannis

Hi,

 

Thanks for your answer. Yes we have strong internal gains in this hangar (we suppose a high rate of lighting gain and a heavy occupant metabolism). But, for me is still very strange the fact that we supposed to have natural ventilation who it supposed to help control this strong gain. 

 

Even if air temperature is high, the roof temperature is also higher with insulation that without insulation.

 

Maybe modeling results are "correct" but one might expect that the temperature of wall should get reduced by using a very thin film of insulation. Despite the fact of the strong internal gains which are the same in both examples,

 

This is a difficult case, where you wonder if the "dynamic model" is in a different sense of "reality"

 

Bes regards and thanks again,

 

David GARCIA-SANCHEZ

Insulation does trap heat and this is a real issue that happens in the real
world and not just in models.  There was a thread on this form last year
about it and papers posted.  I would suggest you look into phase change
materials rather then insulation- they will absorb the energy and cool the
space down to enhance comfort during the day and release that heat into the
space at night to keep it warm. There is a video of a metal building
install at this link--->
http://www.phasechange.com/index.php/en/install-portfolio/videos

In addition to PCM's I suggest you look into high emissivity / reflectivity
paints or coatings.

David,

I must admitt that it?s really extrange what it's happening to you. But the
only explanation is the SRI that it may change when you change the roof
composition. A metal sheet can easy have a SRI 0.6 and cement unpainted 0.2.

In a way it?s true that when you have a building with high internal load
and no HVAC system when you increased the insulation level in the envelope
the interior temperature normally gets high. (In the same way that
insulation dont let external heat get in, it doesnt allow internal heat
gets out). But in this cases it?s always recomended to keep the roof
insolation high.

Good luck!

Depending on your climate, you may find a CoolRoof may add more value than insulation.  There are some products that claim very high solar reflectance (90%+) combined with high long wave emissivity (.92+) which can keep the roof itself cool thus reducing the sub-roof temperature and under some conditions creating a negative heat pump effect due to sky cooling that occurs in the daytime.  There are a number of products out there that use a ceramic nanospehere particle additive to the roof paint that lifts solar reflectance by 15-20%.  So when applied to a TiO2 white you can get into the 90%'s.

If your climate is cooling dominated you may find this a useful strategy.  If you have a cold climate then this can work against you but it sounds like cooling is the problem.

Melbourne Airport has successfully used such a product so I don't believe there are any concerns with the high diffusing reflectance around airports.

Most software packages will model a truly cool roof properly including IES-VE and the DOE-2.2 / E+ engines.  The problem is they don't represent more conventional and absorptive roofs which create a roof micro-climate that is biased upwards from ambient.  I am digressing, but thought I would promote this issue a bit as I would love our industry software to recognise this microclimate effect so that we drive better roof designs.  And where we have cooling equipment and outdoor air intakes at roof level, that we have the mechanisms to account for the higher condensing temperatures and higher ventilation air temperatures.  The issues are particular to large roofs like shopping centres, airports, manufacturing facilities etc.  I wrote a paper on this (attached) to try and give this issue some visibility.  Please keep asking your software vendors for these issues to be represented in your software fully ...

Also with your hangar do you have the space stratified?  While you can stratify in IES-VE and get an indication of annual bulk conditions, it would be best tested in CFD using IES-VE to get your boundary conditions if you are interested in more than just every, i.e. comfort.

Graham

Dear Rut,
Thanks for your reply!
In my opinion, Q=m*cp*delta_t. During the transport of cold water, there is no mass loss, so m stay constant, and assume cp is constant. Assume the thermal loss=delta_Q, then, delta_Q=m*cp*delta_t1. Because delta_Q=10%*Q, then, delta_t1=10%*delta_t.
I think the above method is reasonable.
But why the delta_t1 will cause a lot of more energy?
Thanks!
Esmi

I've come across the same scenario before.  I would say Mitchell's method is a reasonable way to go.  


Additionally, the 10% loss in Temp (F) should be not equal to 10% in Thermal energy (Btu/h).  This is most likely why you see huge spike in energy consumption.  You'd have to identify the thermal property of the CHW and HW at the supply temp (in Btu/h), and determine the loss in Btu/h that is equal to 10%.  If there is no loop loss Btu/h input, you could back-calculate the reduced Btu/h in water to determine the DT.

Hi Mitchell,
Thanks for your reply!
I really don't know how the DT work. Why a little DT can give a huge rise in the energy consumption?
Further, will the GBCI reviewer question the way of setting DT to represent the loop loss? Did you give any specific explanation on the DT, or just leave it without narrative?
Thanks!

Dear all,
As required by the district thermal energy guidance, the loop loss should be 5% for the cooling loop and 10% for the heating loop.
However, there is only DT input for the loop loss option panel. If the supply and return temperature difference is 40 F for the heating loop, the loss should be 4 F. But after I set the loss DT as 4F, the heating energy consumption will increase heavily, even 3 times of the orginal heating energy consumption.
So I wonder how it works. Does anybody have experience on it?
Thanks!
Esmi

Graham,
I have only skimmed the paper so far, but the hypothesis is one makes a lot of common sense.  I never gave the roof micro-climate much thought while using EnergyPlus, but I have personal experience of roof-mounted cooling equipment under-performing due to the roof's elevated temperature in the vicinity of an air-cooled condenser.  Thanks for bring the two parts of my brain together!
p.s. a full reading of your paper will follow in the next few days.

Also with your hangar do you have the space stratified?  While you can stratify in IES-VE and get an indication of annual bulk conditions, it would be best tested in CFD using IES-VE to get your boundary conditions if you are interested in more than just every, i.e. comfort.

Graham

Esmi,

I have made the same conclusion before, but the increase in energy consumption was unreasonably high, as you've observed; thus, prompting further look.  However, in eQUEST I have the alternative in inputting Loop Loss in Supply Loss UA, in addition to Loss dT.

Without knowing how your model was set up, it's hard for me to speculate any further on the energy+costs increase.

If you can determine the energy consumption of the district/primary loop, then continue to adjust your Loop Loss deltaT until the additional 10% is met per Mitchell's suggestion.  You can document the results to provide to LEED for supporting docs.

Good luck,

Rut

Dear Rut,
Thanks for your reply!
In my opinion, Q=m*cp*delta_t. During the transport of cold water, there is no mass loss, so m stay constant, and assume cp is constant. Assume the thermal loss=delta_Q, then, delta_Q=m*cp*delta_t1. Because delta_Q=10%*Q, then, delta_t1=10%*delta_t.
I think the above method is reasonable.
But why the delta_t1 will cause a lot of more energy?
Thanks!
Esmi

Additionally, the 10% loss in Temp (F) should be not equal to 10% in Thermal energy (Btu/h).  This is most likely why you see huge spike in energy consumption.  You'd have to identify the thermal property of the CHW and HW at the supply temp (in Btu/h), and determine the loss in Btu/h that is equal to 10%.  If there is no loop loss Btu/h input, you could back-calculate the reduced Btu/h in water to determine the DT.

Hi Mitchell,
Thanks for your reply!
I really don't know how the DT work. Why a little DT can give a huge rise in the energy consumption?
Further, will the GBCI reviewer question the way of setting DT to represent the loop loss? Did you give any specific explanation on the DT, or just leave it without narrative?
Thanks!

Dear all,
As required by the district thermal energy guidance, the loop loss should be 5% for the cooling loop and 10% for the heating loop.
However, there is only DT input for the loop loss option panel. If the supply and return temperature difference is 40 F for the heating loop, the loss should be 4 F. But after I set the loss DT as 4F, the heating energy consumption will increase heavily, even 3 times of the orginal heating energy consumption.
So I wonder how it works. Does anybody have experience on it?
Thanks!
Esmi

Message-ID: <89B4FB2D5DE7614EB31CD320ED524958CD324D1072@TOR-SVR-EX5.mcw.com>

Hello,

We have an EE4 model that we wish to check against NECB. Can anyone suggest a procedure for this?

My initial thought was to create a second model, where the Proposed Building is manually set to match the NECB requirements, then compare the original Proposed Building to the NECB Proposed Building.

However, I am wondering if I can manually modify the Reference Building to match the NECB requirements using a DOE work-around.

Thank you,

Creating a second EE4 Proposed building as the Reference case would 
get around having to modify the Reference case .DOE file.  If you 
modify the .DOE reference file, you have to run the file from the 
command line.  Matching the Reference case HVAC systems requirements 
will be the biggest challenge, see Table 8.4.4.8.A and Table 8.4.4.8.B.

Hell Brian,

In NECB there a procedure for reference case in section 8.
You will have to model using either eQuest, 
CanQuest or EE4 a reference case with section 8 
procedure to compare with the proposed.

Soon we should have a CanQuest version that will compare to NECB

Hope this help

Martin

Subject: [Bldg-sim] FW: Apparent error on ASHRAE 90.1-2007 (and perhaps 2010)
Message-ID: <FC1586506FC3D647A8CEAB83BA211A6938A636C33C@CH2MBX01.ch2.comcast.net>

Dear forums,
I think I have discovered an error in the SI version of ASHRAE 90.1 regarding fan power for Baseline Systems 1 & 2.  I sent the message below to ASHRAE, but then thought, "Perhaps someone else has also noticed this and received some guidance from ASHRAE".  Regardless, if it is actually an error, it's worth mentioning to all of you so that you can be aware of it.
Please  let me know if you are aware of this, and how you have dealt with the discrepancy.  My plan is to use the IP formula because it allows more fan power :).

Subject: Apparent error on ASHRAE 90.1-2007 (and perhaps 2010)

Dear ASHRAE,
I am comparing Appendix G fan power calculations for ASHRAE 90.1 in both SI and IP units.  It appears that they do not agree for Baseline Systems 1 & 2.
The formulae for Systems 1 & 2 are:
(IP): Pfan (watts) = CFMs (cfm) * 0.3
(SI): Pfan (watts) = CFMs (L/s) * 0.3

Calculating fan power for Systems 1&2:
Given:
L/s * 1000 = m3/s
m3/s * 2118.64 = cfm

Substituting these into the fan power equations for Baseline Systems 1 & 2:
(SI): (1 L/s * 1000) * .3 = 300 W
(IP): 2118.64 cfm * .3  = 636 W

The fan power should be identical, but isn't even close! Have you ever noticed this?  I could not find an errata sheet that corrected the formula. Will you please check to see if there is a correction?  Please make a correction if I am not missing something!
Thank you!

p.s., In a smaller way, the fan power calculations do not agree for the other System types.  This appears to be due in part to using 5 digit precision for IP units and 4 digits for SI (e.g., 0.00094 for IP and 0.0015 for SI)  If you use SI factors of 0.0014857 and 0.0020547 for Systems 3-4 and 5-8 respectively, the agreement is better.

Fabiano,
It's encouraging that they noticed something, however I don't think the math works properly with the formula you sent.
(SI): (1 L/s * 1000) * .14 = 140 W (This is 1 m3/s)
(IP): 2118.64 cfm * .3  = 636 W  (This is also 1 m3/s)

A factor of .636 seems to work better.

Hey Jim,



I think you are right.



0.3 x CFM = W



0.3 x (L/S) /0.472 = W



thus



0.636 x L/S = W





Thanks,

Marcin

Forgot to say:
A factor of .636 seems to work better.
(SI): (1 L/s * 1000) * .636 = 636 W (This is 1 m3/s)
(IP): 2118.64 cfm * .3  = 636 W  (This is also 1 m3/s)

Fabiano,
It?s encouraging that they noticed something, however I don?t think the math works properly with the formula you sent.
(SI): (1 L/s * 1000) * .14 = 140 W (This is 1 m3/s)
(IP): 2118.64 cfm * .3  = 636 W  (This is also 1 m3/s)

Assunto: [EnergyPlus_Support] FW: Apparent error on ASHRAE 90.1-2007 (and perhaps 2010)

Dear forums,
I think I have discovered an error in the SI version of ASHRAE 90.1 regarding fan power for Baseline Systems 1 & 2.  I sent the message below to ASHRAE, but then thought, ?Perhaps someone else has also noticed this and received some guidance from ASHRAE?.  Regardless, if it is actually an error, it?s worth mentioning to all of you so that you can be aware of it.
Please  let me know if you are aware of this, and how you have dealt with the discrepancy.  My plan is to use the IP formula because it allows more fan power :).

Subject: Apparent error on ASHRAE 90.1-2007 (and perhaps 2010)

Dear ASHRAE,
I am comparing Appendix G fan power calculations for ASHRAE 90.1 in both SI and IP units.  It appears that they do not agree for Baseline Systems 1 & 2.
The formulae for Systems 1 & 2 are:
(IP): Pfan (watts) = CFMs (cfm) * 0.3
(SI): Pfan (watts) = CFMs (L/s) * 0.3

Calculating fan power for Systems 1&2:
Given:
L/s * 1000 = m3/s
m3/s * 2118.64 = cfm

Substituting these into the fan power equations for Baseline Systems 1 & 2:
(SI): (1 L/s * 1000) * .3 = 300 W
(IP): 2118.64 cfm * .3  = 636 W

The fan power should be identical, but isn?t even close! Have you ever noticed this?  I could not find an errata sheet that corrected the formula. Will you please check to see if there is a correction?  Please make a correction if I am not missing something!
Thank you!

p.s., In a smaller way, the fan power calculations do not agree for the other System types.  This appears to be due in part to using 5 digit precision for IP units and 4 digits for SI (e.g., 0.00094 for IP and 0.0015 for SI)  If you use SI factors of 0.0014857 and 0.0020547 for Systems 3-4 and 5-8 respectively, the agreement is better.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modeling CHP Plants serving Campus DES
Message-ID: <DUB103-W24C719AF41C76011AB9985E0B20@phx.gbl>

Hi all,

I'm looking for guidance on the interpretation of CHP modeling according to Appendix B in the LEED Canada Interpretation Guide for District Energy Systems or Appendix D in the USGBC Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED v2 and LEED 2009 using the Method 2/Option 2 route.

For the project that I'm working on, metered data is available. Annual metered electricity consumption shows that the campus uses 73%
 of the electricity generated by the CHP plant with the remaining 27% 
coming from grid supplied electricity. So, I intend to use this fraction
 and apply it to the total electricity consumption of the proposed 
building. Charge the 27% at the local grid supplied electricity rates 
and charge the remaining 73% CHP generated electricity based on Annual 
Fuel Input Cost to CHP ($)/Annual CHP Electricity Generation (kWh).


Again from metered data, 67% of the heating energy supplied to the 
DES is from the waste heat generated by the CHP plant. The remaining 33%
 is provided by backup boilers using grid supplied natural gas. So 67% 
of the proposed building's heating energy will be "free" with the 
remaining 33% charged based on local natural gas utility rates. I'm setting the proposed boiler efficiency equal to the back up boiler efficiency.


The baseline building heating and electricity consumption will be charged at the local utility rates.

Is this methodology acceptable for the proposed model? I'm not sure if I should be using the formulas provided in the Appendix to calculate CHP Electric Output and CHP Fuel Input? Are these formulas to be used when metered data is not available?


Thanks

D?nal

ENERGY AND CLIMATE CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION ENGINEER

Transsolar is an international climate engineering firm with offices in Stuttgart (Germany), Munich, and New York.  We are seeking talented, highly motivated engineers for our New York office.

Transsolar develops and validate concepts for high quality environments that require minimal energy use. To achieve this we work collaboratively within the design team from the start of the design process, considering each step from the standpoint of fundamental thermodynamics. This generates a climate concept in which form, material, and mechanical systems are synergistic components of a well-orchestrated climate control system; and conversely, an environmental control strategy that is integral to the architectural concept.

We use a wide variety of complex computer simulation tools to evaluate our concepts, developing unique analytical methods based on a deep understanding of engineering physics. We perform dynamic thermal simulation using TRNSYS to develop and validate appropriate, reliable concepts in relationship to the complex set of factors that is unique to each project. Similarly, we perform daylight simulations using RADIANCE and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using FLUENT. 

Transsolar engineers carry out a broad range of tasks. Responsibilities for this position include:

-Development of climate and energy concepts in response to local climate, site, architectural, and programmatic requirements
-Development, testing and validation of concepts via thermal simulation (TRNSYS)
-Engineering analysis via EES, hand calculation, spreadsheet analysis, and other engineering analysis tools
-Programming of new simulation and analysis tools in TRNSYS, EES, spreadsheets, and with other computational methods
-Internal coordination with other simulation specialists, synthesis, and communication of overall analysis results
-Graphical representation of climate concepts and complex engineering analysis
-Writing reports and correspondence
-Participation in meetings and design charettes
-Collaboration with German Transsolar offices
-Domestic and international travel to project meetings and sites

Engineers with an emphasis on dynamic thermal simulation are our highest priority.   Both entry-level positions and positions for 3-5 years experience are available.  Our New York office is small but growing, providing ample opportunity for advancement.

Preferred qualifications include:

-Engineering or applied science education related to building energy flows and building science: heat transfer, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, indoor and outdoor human comfort, etc. Ideal is a degree in mechanical engineering or applied physics. An M.S. is strongly preferred.
-Experience with computational engineering analysis (text-based input, computer programming, scripting such as Perl, spreadsheet analysis and macro programming such as VBA)
-Experience with dynamic thermal simulation (energy simulation)
-Proven ability to creatively develop and apply non-traditional climate solutions to the indoor environment
-Education/professional experience with current and advanced architectural technologies (e.g. building envelope) and mechanical systems for building climate control 
-Experience with physical testing of engineering systems: system construction, instrumentation and measurement, etc.
-Experience collaborating and communicating in the early stages of an architectural design process with both technical and non-technical audiences
-Excellent oral and written communication skills
-Computer-based drawing skills (e.g. Corel Draw, Adobe Illustrator, etc)

Applicants with an architectural background will not be considered; an engineering- or science-based degree is required for this position.  Prior experience with TRNSYS is not required.
Interested applicants may submit their resume and cover letter via email to nycjobs at transsolar.com

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1 lighting control question
Message-ID: <B7FE24EB2E85FD47B9EB4A8DA59E76EFAC1EFEC3D2@TREXCHMAIL.corp.tridel.com>

Hello everyone,

A quick question regarding ASHRAE 90.1-2007 lighting control requirements (as I typically model buildings in Canada, and am not used to referencing ASHRAE 90.1).

Appendix G references section 9.4.1 for control, which states that automatic controls (e.g. occupancy sensors) are required in certain classrooms, conference/meeting rooms and lunch/break rooms.  Does this mean that I will need to model the appropriate LPD reduction factor per Table G3.2  in these spaces in the reference building, as well as the proposed model (if they are installed)? I.e., no credit given?  90.1-2010 seems to expand on this, identifying occupant sensors specifically, and adding restrooms, small offices, lockers rooms and some storage room.

Do I have this right?

Thanks,

In spirit we're on the same page, but in practice I've come to approach this slightly differently:

I do not touch the Baseline model at all in regards to classrooms, breakrooms, and conference/meeting rooms.  Rather, I understand that the fractional lighting schedule used in both models is taken to represent the prescriptively required sensors (there's language in Table G3.1 along these lines), and in turn I simply do not allow for an LPD reduction for those spaces in the Proposed model.

I expect the two approaches probably do not have a meaningfully different end-result for most projects, but can anecdotally affirm the above approach has made it through several LEED reviews.

Maria,

Yes, there is a model for ice and eutectic thermal energy storage in
DOE-2.1E PLANT.  I've actually used it more than 12 years ago to model the
first LEED-Gold office building in China, so I can vouch that it gave
reasonable results.

Hi, I'm doing a LEED certificate project and I encounter a difficult problem.
The review questioned the building area that the "Total site energy"/"energy intensity per gross-area" are different in the baseline and proposed cases, according to BEPS. However, in LV-B, the total building areas are the same in both cases.
Can anybody figure it out? I don't know how to explain it.

The BEPS report uses the conditioned area. Your "conditioned" areas might be different between the Proposed and the Baselie. Compare the floor areas you get at the LS-C reports (on top of that report).

Dear
all,
?
We are
running a questionnaire as part of our research project called ?Developing better outputs from building thermal
simulation tools to improve decision making in the design of low energy
buildings? and
would be really happy if you could complete it.
?
It is very short, and can be found at;
?
https://www.surveys.cardiff.ac.uk/simulation
The questionnaire is part of a study that aims to
promote and aid the design
of the next generation of energy-efficient low carbon buildings through the
development of appropriate simulation post-processing and data representation
systems that can be more easily integrated into the design process than?current
ones. The questions refer to goals, aims and actions involved in design
activities as well as to analysis processes and useful information to design
decision making. They refer to how building designers work and act in practice
and are useful for simulation software developers to produce meaningful
post-processed information and data representation systems to building
designers.
?
For
further information on the project please see;

Answers to some more questions

DOE2.1E runs in the Command Prompt (DOS) window.

I could not run it with 64-bit computer and Windows 7.

It works with Windows XP Mode & Virtual PC in Windows 7 (see attachment)

I still prefer the BDL method of input because you are left with a text
specifications or report of the building loads, systems, plant & economics.

I have templates to model most of the features of DOE2.1E schedules, loads,
systems, plant & economics (see attached examples - not executable)

I think it is possible to do all this with EnergyPlus also.

The eQUEST method of tracing AutoCad drawings is an excellent method to
create the building physical model.

It is fast & accurate and easy to check.

Varkie, others,

I don't have any troubles running my version of DOE-2.1E on a 64-bit machine.  This may 
have something to do with the source code or compilation, since my version is the latest 
available from LBNL (same as from ESTSC), Version 124, dated 2008.   I'm in the process of 
setting up an open-source center through which this DOE-2.1E code and executable will be 
made available and maintained.   Until that time, anyone with interest in this version of 
DOE-2.1E can  send me an e-mail.

I have no problem running DOE2.1e with Windows 7 64 bit.  I use three 
different versions of DOE2.1e from the command line, all work as expected.

Message-ID: <DUB103-W38C8594F582A476434C683E0C70@phx.gbl>

Dear Bldg Sim,

I'm looking for guidance on the definition of a University Dormitory building that I'm modeling under LEED 2009, particularly referencing Table G3.1.1A Baseline HVAC System Types. The building has 9 storeys above grade with an underground basement, with a total floor area of approx. 125,000 sq. ft.

The Basement is primarily crawlspace, electrical, mechanical, student storage etc.

The Main Floor consists of a number of multi-purpose rooms, further storage facilities for bicycles, recycling etc, with 1/3 of the main floor plan dedicated to student residences.

The remaining floors, 2 - 9, are student residences with a number of break out/study rooms/lounge areas on each floor.

Is the building classified as "Residential", or is it considered "Nonresidential and More than 5 floors or > 150,000 sq. ft" due to the basement and main floor spaces not being "Residential"? Will I have to model the basement and the main floor separate from floors 2-9?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Cheers

D?nal

However.....
The notes in that table clarify as shown below.  I think the notes indicate that Donal's "predominant" building type is residential.  It sounds as though there are some "non-predominant" types as well.  Take a look at G3.1.1's Exceptions for a description of those.

I would classify it as Residential. It would seem strange to have a 
dormitory classified as non-residential. If the common areas qualify 
under G3.1.1 then they would be modeled as system type 3 or 4.

Per the exception noted by Mr Dirkes, I would model the Baseline building based on Table G3.1.1A; except with the dorm rooms, modeled them with System 1 or 2.

Here is how I come to this decision:


  *   Since your dormitory building contains some non-residential space types, you shouldn't use the building type to determine your Baseline, ie it's no longer truly a residential building type
  *   Dorm rooms still fall under the residential space type, so use residential Baseline systems (1 or 2) for those spaces
  *   "Other building and space types are considered nonresidential"  This statement allows the rest of the building to be modeled per standard baseline (area, # of floors, energy source).

I see the same thought process applies to the mixed-use (commercial/apartments) as well.  With the rise of mixed-use commercial building, I'm sure we'll be seeing this type of scenario more often.  I welcome any comments or suggestions.

Thanks,

Rut Wattanasak

D?nal,

Our team recently modeled a similar university dorm (Basement + Main floor with office spaces + four floors or residential units) for LEED 2009.

We determined that the Baseline should be based on "Residential" (as indicated by the note on Table G3.1.1A that says to use the predominant condition to determine the system type for the entire building) and used System 2 (electric-type heating in our Proposed case). For the common areas such as the office spaces in the first floor, you can use the same type of system (1 per zone) if they do not meet Exception G3.1.1a.

The LEED reviewers accepted our approach and we got our 8 points for that project EAc1.

Good luck,

 *   Dorm rooms still fall under the residential space type, so use residential Baseline systems (1 or 2) for those spaces
 *   "Other building and space types are considered nonresidential"  This statement allows the rest of the building to be modeled per standard baseline (area, # of floors, energy source).

I see the same thought process applies to the mixed-use (commercial/apartments) as well.  With the rise of mixed-use commercial building, I'm sure we'll be seeing this type of scenario more often.  I welcome any comments or suggestions.

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Definition of a University Dormitory - Residential or Non-Residential?

Dear Bldg Sim,

I'm looking for guidance on the definition of a University Dormitory building that I'm modeling under LEED 2009, particularly referencing Table G3.1.1A Baseline HVAC System Types. The building has 9 storeys above grade with an underground basement, with a total floor area of approx. 125,000 sq. ft.

The Basement is primarily crawlspace, electrical, mechanical, student storage etc.

The Main Floor consists of a number of multi-purpose rooms, further storage facilities for bicycles, recycling etc, with 1/3 of the main floor plan dedicated to student residences.

The remaining floors, 2 - 9, are student residences with a number of break out/study rooms/lounge areas on each floor.

Is the building classified as "Residential", or is it considered "Nonresidential and More than 5 floors or > 150,000 sq. ft" due to the basement and main floor spaces not being "Residential"? Will I have to model the basement and the main floor separate from floors 2-9?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Cheers

D?nal

Hi all,

Thank you for your responses thus far.

I did a quick calculation of the areas. Total Residential Floor area is approx. 75,000 sq. ft. and total Non-residential  is approx. 50,000 sq. ft. The Non-residential areas include the basement, main floor multi-purpose rooms, lobbies, storage etc, and the common corridors, elec, janitor, lounge/study areas on Floors 2-9.

So if we are in agreement that the Residential areas are to use either System 1 or System 2, the next question is what are the Non-residential areas classified as? From Table G3.1.1A it appears the number of floors take precedence over the floor area, so as the Non-residential area extends over 10 floors, it should be classified as System 7 or System 8. Am I correct in saying that the number of floors takes precedence over the floor area?

Thanks again for your help and guidance.

Cheers

D?nal

Those are support spaces for the residential and can just be the same
system type, as that?s the predominant space type.  Anything else is
needlessly complicated.  The enclosed document is useful for establishing
modeling inputs for residential projects.

I second the approach described by Demba. Rut wrote ?Since your dormitory
building contains some non-residential space types, you shouldn't use the
building type to determine your Baseline, ie it's no longer truly a
residential building type?. I disagree that presence of spaces such as
electrical/mechanical rooms, corridors, stairs, multi-purpose rooms, etc.
automatically means that this is not a residential building type. It is hard
to imagine a dormitory, hotel, motel, or multifamily without these, and
System 7/8 is hardly an appropriate baseline for such spaces (there would
have to be a system modeled for each floor).  

You should also remember that only the area of conditioned spaces as defined
in 90.1 Section 3 is counted when determining baseline system type (G3.1.1),
so spaces like electrical/mechanical or storage may not have to be factored
in. 

Thanks,

Maria

I second the approach described by Demba.

I disagree that presence of spaces such as electrical/mechanical rooms, corridors, stairs, multi-purpose rooms, etc. automatically means that this is not a residential building type. It is hard to imagine a dormitory, hotel, motel, or multifamily without these, and System 7/8 is hardly an appropriate baseline for such spaces (there would have to be a system modeled for each floor).
You should also remember that only the area of conditioned spaces as defined in 90.1 Section 3 is counted when determining baseline system type (G3.1.1), so spaces like electrical/mechanical or storage may not have to be factored in.

Hi all,

Thank you for your responses thus far.

I did a quick calculation of the areas. Total Residential Floor area is approx. 75,000 sq. ft. and total Non-residential  is approx. 50,000 sq. ft. The Non-residential areas include the basement, main floor multi-purpose rooms, lobbies, storage etc, and the common corridors, elec, janitor, lounge/study areas on Floors 2-9.

So if we are in agreement that the Residential areas are to use either System 1 or System 2, the next question is what are the Non-residential areas classified as? From Table G3.1.1A it appears the number of floors take precedence over the floor area, so as the Non-residential area extends over 10 floors, it should be classified as System 7 or System 8. Am I correct in saying that the number of floors takes precedence over the floor area?

Thanks again for your help and guidance.

Cheers

D?nal

Here is how I come to this decision:


 *   Since your dormitory building contains some non-residential space types, you shouldn't use the building type to determine your Baseline, ie it's no longer truly a residential building type
 *   Dorm rooms still fall under the residential space type, so use residential Baseline systems (1 or 2) for those spaces
 *   "Other building and space types are considered nonresidential"  This statement allows the rest of the building to be modeled per standard baseline (area, # of floors, energy source).

I see the same thought process applies to the mixed-use (commercial/apartments) as well.  With the rise of mixed-use commercial building, I'm sure we'll be seeing this type of scenario more often.  I welcome any comments or suggestions.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Definition of a University Dormitory - Residential or Non-Residential?

Dear Bldg Sim,

I'm looking for guidance on the definition of a University Dormitory building that I'm modeling under LEED 2009, particularly referencing Table G3.1.1A Baseline HVAC System Types. The building has 9 storeys above grade with an underground basement, with a total floor area of approx. 125,000 sq. ft.

The Basement is primarily crawlspace, electrical, mechanical, student storage etc.

The Main Floor consists of a number of multi-purpose rooms, further storage facilities for bicycles, recycling etc, with 1/3 of the main floor plan dedicated to student residences.

The remaining floors, 2 - 9, are student residences with a number of break out/study rooms/lounge areas on each floor.

Is the building classified as "Residential", or is it considered "Nonresidential and More than 5 floors or > 150,000 sq. ft" due to the basement and main floor spaces not being "Residential"? Will I have to model the basement and the main floor separate from floors 2-9?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Cheers

D?nal

Yet another perspective is that when high-rise residential buildings are
modeled with Systems 7/8 serving common spaces on each floor, even very
modest proposed designs, such as minimally code compliant PTACs, often show
hefty savings compared to the baseline because many of the prescribed
Appendix G settings and controls misfire (e.g. 0.4 cfm/sf minimum setpoints
for VAV reheat in G3.1.3.13). This is an issue for incentive programs that
use Appendix G protocol, because they end up with some pretty ridiculous
ECMs that on paper qualify for incentives.

Non-Residential. Period.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Definition of a University Dormitory - Residential or

Dear Bldg Sim,

I'm looking for guidance on the definition of a University Dormitory
building that I'm modeling under LEED 2009, particularly referencing Table
G3.1.1A Baseline HVAC System Types. The building has 9 storeys above grade
with an underground basement, with a total floor area of approx. 125,000 sq.
ft.

The Basement is primarily crawlspace, electrical, mechanical, student
storage etc.

The Main Floor consists of a number of multi-purpose rooms, further storage
facilities for bicycles, recycling etc, with 1/3 of the main floor plan
dedicated to student residences.

The remaining floors, 2 - 9, are student residences with a number of break
out/study rooms/lounge areas on each floor.

Is the building classified as "Residential", or is it considered
"Nonresidential and More than 5 floors or > 150,000 sq. ft" due to the
basement and main floor spaces not being "Residential"? Will I have to model
the basement and the main floor separate from floors 2-9?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Cheers

D?nal

Good morning, all,

 

Yes, dormitories are residential spaces (remember this also affects your
baseline building envelope requirements). In this instance since the
non-residential spaces total more than 20,000 square feet, an alternate HVAC
system type should be selected for the predominant condition. Depending on
the operating schedules, internal loads, etc. (the other exceptions to
Section G3.1.1) using a third system type may be appropriate (type 3 or 4).
Whether it is appropriate to count the common areas on the residential
floors to determine the system type for the non-predominant condition could
be argued either way. Before proceeding either way, I would suggest looking
for any LEED Interpretations since the reviewer is likely to hold you to
previously published interpretations. I also believe mixed-use residential
projects are discussed in the Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED 2009 (free
to registered projects and available in LEED online under the credit
resources tab).

 

Hope this helps!

Yet another perspective is that when high-rise residential buildings are
modeled with Systems 7/8 serving common spaces on each floor, even very
modest proposed designs, such as minimally code compliant PTACs, often show
hefty savings compared to the baseline because many of the prescribed
Appendix G settings and controls misfire (e.g. 0.4 cfm/sf minimum setpoints
for VAV reheat in G3.1.3.13). This is an issue for incentive programs that
use Appendix G protocol, because they end up with some pretty ridiculous
ECMs that on paper qualify for incentives.

I second the approach described by Demba. Rut wrote ?Since your dormitory
building contains some non-residential space types, you shouldn't use the
building type to determine your Baseline, ie it's no longer truly a
residential building type?. I disagree that presence of spaces such as
electrical/mechanical rooms, corridors, stairs, multi-purpose rooms, etc.
automatically means that this is not a residential building type. It is hard
to imagine a dormitory, hotel, motel, or multifamily without these, and
System 7/8 is hardly an appropriate baseline for such spaces (there would
have to be a system modeled for each floor).  

You should also remember that only the area of conditioned spaces as defined
in 90.1 Section 3 is counted when determining baseline system type (G3.1.1),
so spaces like electrical/mechanical or storage may not have to be factored
in. 

Thanks,

Maria

Hi all,

Thank you for your responses thus far.

I did a quick calculation of the areas. Total Residential Floor area is
approx. 75,000 sq. ft. and total Non-residential  is approx. 50,000 sq. ft.
The Non-residential areas include the basement, main floor multi-purpose
rooms, lobbies, storage etc, and the common corridors, elec, janitor,
lounge/study areas on Floors 2-9.

So if we are in agreement that the Residential areas are to use either
System 1 or System 2, the next question is what are the Non-residential
areas classified as? From Table G3.1.1A it appears the number of floors take
precedence over the floor area, so as the Non-residential area extends over
10 floors, it should be classified as System 7 or System 8. Am I correct in
saying that the number of floors takes precedence over the floor area?

Thanks again for your help and guidance.

Cheers

D?nal

Per the exception noted by Mr Dirkes, I would model the Baseline building
based on Table G3.1.1A; except with the dorm rooms, modeled them with System
1 or 2. 

 

Here is how I come to this decision:

 

*	Since your dormitory building contains some non-residential space
types, you shouldn't use the building type to determine your Baseline, ie
it's no longer truly a residential building type
*	Dorm rooms still fall under the residential space type, so use
residential Baseline systems (1 or 2) for those spaces
*	"Other building and space types are considered nonresidential"  This
statement allows the rest of the building to be modeled per standard
baseline (area, # of floors, energy source).

 

I see the same thought process applies to the mixed-use
(commercial/apartments) as well.  With the rise of mixed-use commercial
building, I'm sure we'll be seeing this type of scenario more often.  I
welcome any comments or suggestions.

 

Thanks,

The notes in that table clarify as shown below.  I think the notes indicate
that Donal?s ?predominant? building type is residential.  It sounds as
though there are some ?non-predominant? types as well.  Take a look at
G3.1.1?s Exceptions for a description of those.

Hi Cam,

I agree with the others that the "non-residential" areas such as common corridors, janitor, elec rooms etc on Floors 2-9 are there to support the residential areas and therefore should be classified as "residential". The "non-residential" areas on the main floor and the basement total approx. 19,000 sq. ft. which is under the 20,000 sq. ft. threshold specified in G3.1.1 Exception (a), so I will specify all areas as "residential" and assign to System 1/2.

Thanks again for all of your responses.

Hi D?nal,

 

The public spaces (common corridors, lounges, and utility spaces) on the
residential floors are classified as non-residential and must be modeled
with a non-residential system type if the total area for these spaces is
more than 20,000 square feet. You can try another approach, but it is likely
that the reviewer will require you to change the model if you use
residential systems in the public spaces.

Hi Cam,

I agree with the others that the "non-residential" areas such as common
corridors, janitor, elec rooms etc on Floors 2-9 are there to support the
residential areas and therefore should be classified as "residential". The
"non-residential" areas on the main floor and the basement total approx.
19,000 sq. ft. which is under the 20,000 sq. ft. threshold specified in
G3.1.1 Exception (a), so I will specify all areas as "residential" and
assign to System 1/2.

Thanks again for all of your responses.

Cheers

D?nal

Good morning, all,

 

Yes, dormitories are residential spaces (remember this also affects your
baseline building envelope requirements). In this instance since the
non-residential spaces total more than 20,000 square feet, an alternate HVAC
system type should be selected for the predominant condition. Depending on
the operating schedules, internal loads, etc. (the other exceptions to
Section G3.1.1) using a third system type may be appropriate (type 3 or 4).
Whether it is appropriate to count the common areas on the residential
floors to determine the system type for the non-predominant condition could
be argued either way. Before proceeding either way, I would suggest looking
for any LEED Interpretations since the reviewer is likely to hold you to
previously published interpretations. I also believe mixed-use residential
projects are discussed in the Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED 2009 (free
to registered projects and available in LEED online under the credit
resources tab).

 

Hope this helps!

Yet another perspective is that when high-rise residential buildings are
modeled with Systems 7/8 serving common spaces on each floor, even very
modest proposed designs, such as minimally code compliant PTACs, often show
hefty savings compared to the baseline because many of the prescribed
Appendix G settings and controls misfire (e.g. 0.4 cfm/sf minimum setpoints
for VAV reheat in G3.1.3.13). This is an issue for incentive programs that
use Appendix G protocol, because they end up with some pretty ridiculous
ECMs that on paper qualify for incentives.

I second the approach described by Demba. Rut wrote ?Since your dormitory
building contains some non-residential space types, you shouldn't use the
building type to determine your Baseline, ie it's no longer truly a
residential building type?. I disagree that presence of spaces such as
electrical/mechanical rooms, corridors, stairs, multi-purpose rooms, etc.
automatically means that this is not a residential building type. It is hard
to imagine a dormitory, hotel, motel, or multifamily without these, and
System 7/8 is hardly an appropriate baseline for such spaces (there would
have to be a system modeled for each floor).  

You should also remember that only the area of conditioned spaces as defined
in 90.1 Section 3 is counted when determining baseline system type (G3.1.1),
so spaces like electrical/mechanical or storage may not have to be factored
in. 

Thanks,

Maria

Hi all,

Thank you for your responses thus far.

I did a quick calculation of the areas. Total Residential Floor area is
approx. 75,000 sq. ft. and total Non-residential  is approx. 50,000 sq. ft.
The Non-residential areas include the basement, main floor multi-purpose
rooms, lobbies, storage etc, and the common corridors, elec, janitor,
lounge/study areas on Floors 2-9.

So if we are in agreement that the Residential areas are to use either
System 1 or System 2, the next question is what are the Non-residential
areas classified as? From Table G3.1.1A it appears the number of floors take
precedence over the floor area, so as the Non-residential area extends over
10 floors, it should be classified as System 7 or System 8. Am I correct in
saying that the number of floors takes precedence over the floor area?

Thanks again for your help and guidance.

Cheers

D?nal

Per the exception noted by Mr Dirkes, I would model the Baseline building
based on Table G3.1.1A; except with the dorm rooms, modeled them with System
1 or 2. 

 

Here is how I come to this decision:

 

*	Since your dormitory building contains some non-residential space
types, you shouldn't use the building type to determine your Baseline, ie
it's no longer truly a residential building type
*	Dorm rooms still fall under the residential space type, so use
residential Baseline systems (1 or 2) for those spaces
*	"Other building and space types are considered nonresidential"  This
statement allows the rest of the building to be modeled per standard
baseline (area, # of floors, energy source).

 

I see the same thought process applies to the mixed-use
(commercial/apartments) as well.  With the rise of mixed-use commercial
building, I'm sure we'll be seeing this type of scenario more often.  I
welcome any comments or suggestions.

 

Thanks,

However
..

The notes in that table clarify as shown below.  I think the notes indicate
that Donal?s ?predominant? building type is residential.  It sounds as
though there are some ?non-predominant? types as well.  Take a look at
G3.1.1?s Exceptions for a description of those.

 

>From 90.1-2007 Table G3.1.1A:

Notes:

Residential building types include dormitory, hotel, motel, and multifamily.
Residential space types include guest rooms, living quarters, private living
space, and sleeping quarters. Other

Dear Bldg Sim,

I'm looking for guidance on the definition of a University Dormitory
building that I'm modeling under LEED 2009, particularly referencing Table
G3.1.1A Baseline HVAC System Types. The building has 9 storeys above grade
with an underground basement, with a total floor area of approx. 125,000 sq.
ft.

The Basement is primarily crawlspace, electrical, mechanical, student
storage etc.

The Main Floor consists of a number of multi-purpose rooms, further storage
facilities for bicycles, recycling etc, with 1/3 of the main floor plan
dedicated to student residences.

The remaining floors, 2 - 9, are student residences with a number of break
out/study rooms/lounge areas on each floor.

Is the building classified as "Residential", or is it considered
"Nonresidential and More than 5 floors or > 150,000 sq. ft" due to the
basement and main floor spaces not being "Residential"? Will I have to model
the basement and the main floor separate from floors 2-9?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Cheers

D?nal

Dear fellow Canadian energy modellers.

We are involved with the energy modeling of a residential glass tower which aims at a LEED Canada-NC certification.

The building envelope is mostly curtain walls with limited amounts of opaque components (spandrel panels among them). When running the model, EE4 gives us an error message saying the building doesn't meet the mandatory requirement 8.2.1.4.(2), which means that the proposed building opaque envelope components (walls and roofs) have an overall U-value higher than 167% of the reference building overall U-value.

Normally, not meeting a mandatory requirement means the building cannot be certified for LEED Canada.

We are trying to find if the CaGBC has generally been lenient about this requirement or not..? I can't find a CIR, or other source / example saying so.

Of course, among the ways around would be to design and model the building against ASHRAE 90.1... but that would means checking against a whole new set of mandatory prescriptions, and completely reworking the energy model. Which we are trying to avoid.

Another way is to remove all offending spandrel panels and replacing them with regular glass component. Not sure how the architect will take this.

Any input / help on this is appreciated.

Hello group,

I have a datacenter room with 2 air conditioner, one for normal use and the
other one for backup if the first one fails.

Do I need to describe this backup airconditioner in the Table 1.4 of Leed?
I guess I don't need to, but I haven't found it in any documentation nor a
reliable source.

Have any of you come across this situation before?

Any suggestion would much appreciated.

 Reset in ASHRAE 90.1-2007
Message-ID: <89B4FB2D5DE7614EB31CD320ED524958CD324D09B0@TOR-SVR-EX5.mcw.com>

Hello,

I am doing an ASHRAE 90.1-2007 PRM analysis for a LEED 2009 CS project, credit EAc1. The baseline system is System 7 - VAV with Reheat.

Appendix G has the following requirements for System 7:
[cid:image003.jpg at 01CE36DF.AC800100]

In keeping with the above requirements, when the temperature is satisfied in any zone, I am supplying 0.4 cfm/ft2 at 59F (54F + 5F reset). This is causing many zones to be overcooled and, therefore, reheated. The result is that I have a significant amount of simultaneous heating and cooling in my baseline model. Section 6.5.2.1 states that reheating, recooling and simultaneous heating/cooling is not allowed unless the air volume is no greater than 0.4 cfm/ft2 (or the larger of 0.4 cfm/ft2, the ventilation requirement, 30% of max flow, etc.). Therefore, my baseline is allowed to overcool and reheat since it is running at 0.4 cfm/ft2.

My proposed model does not have this problem as it is allowed to go below 0.4 cfm/ft2 and it is allowed to reset by more than 5F. I am achieving unreasonably high savings as a result of this issue.

What I find interesting is that G3.1.3.13 has been revised for ASHRAE 90.1-2010 to the following:
[cid:image004.jpg at 01CE36DF.AC800100]

The minimum is no longer an absolute 0.4 cfm/ft2 but a relative 30% of zone peak air flow. In mild or heating dominated climates 30% of zone peak air flow can be much less than 0.4 cfm/ft2.

By changing the requirement for 90.1-2010 is this an acknowledgement by ASHRAE that the previous requirement could lead to an inefficient baseline model? Am I justified in exploiting it to achieve high savings?

Thank you!

Frederic,

This must be a very tall tower if the roof can't carry the entire envelope over the requirement. It does sounds like your options are to either beef up the roof insulation or add more glass (which admittedly sounds silly, but is compliant).

Cam,

 

I believe that common spaces such as corridors, stairs, etc. should be
treated as residential when they are in buildings that fall under
residential building type as defined in the first note below Table G3.1.1A.
Also, based on Table G3.1#3 Space Use Classification, ? Usage shall be
specified using the building type or space type lighting classifications in
accordance with Section 9.5.1 or 9.6.1.? Table 9.5.1 has Multifamily
building type, which includes corridors, stairs, etc. (Note that G3.1.#3 is
otherwise not related to lighting.)

 

Another argument in favor of my interpretation is the example in 90.1 User
Manual for Sections 11 and Appendix G. It involves a mixed use building with
residential and non-residential floors (see screenshot below), and sets
System 1 (PTACs) as the baseline for residential floors, and System 5 (PVAV)
as the baseline for non-residential floors. If corridors on residential
floors were combined with non-residential floors below for the purpose of
determining baseline HVAC, we?d end up with more than 5 stories of
non-residential space, which would give us System 7 and not System 5. 

 



 

Thanks,

 

Maria

Hi D?nal,

 

The public spaces (common corridors, lounges, and utility spaces) on the
residential floors are classified as non-residential and must be modeled
with a non-residential system type if the total area for these spaces is
more than 20,000 square feet. You can try another approach, but it is likely
that the reviewer will require you to change the model if you use
residential systems in the public spaces.

Hi Cam,

I agree with the others that the "non-residential" areas such as common
corridors, janitor, elec rooms etc on Floors 2-9 are there to support the
residential areas and therefore should be classified as "residential". The
"non-residential" areas on the main floor and the basement total approx.
19,000 sq. ft. which is under the 20,000 sq. ft. threshold specified in
G3.1.1 Exception (a), so I will specify all areas as "residential" and
assign to System 1/2.

Thanks again for all of your responses.

Cheers

D?nal

Good morning, all,

 

Yes, dormitories are residential spaces (remember this also affects your
baseline building envelope requirements). In this instance since the
non-residential spaces total more than 20,000 square feet, an alternate HVAC
system type should be selected for the predominant condition. Depending on
the operating schedules, internal loads, etc. (the other exceptions to
Section G3.1.1) using a third system type may be appropriate (type 3 or 4).
Whether it is appropriate to count the common areas on the residential
floors to determine the system type for the non-predominant condition could
be argued either way. Before proceeding either way, I would suggest looking
for any LEED Interpretations since the reviewer is likely to hold you to
previously published interpretations. I also believe mixed-use residential
projects are discussed in the Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED 2009 (free
to registered projects and available in LEED online under the credit
resources tab).

 

Hope this helps!

Yet another perspective is that when high-rise residential buildings are
modeled with Systems 7/8 serving common spaces on each floor, even very
modest proposed designs, such as minimally code compliant PTACs, often show
hefty savings compared to the baseline because many of the prescribed
Appendix G settings and controls misfire (e.g. 0.4 cfm/sf minimum setpoints
for VAV reheat in G3.1.3.13). This is an issue for incentive programs that
use Appendix G protocol, because they end up with some pretty ridiculous
ECMs that on paper qualify for incentives.

I second the approach described by Demba. Rut wrote ?Since your dormitory
building contains some non-residential space types, you shouldn't use the
building type to determine your Baseline, ie it's no longer truly a
residential building type?. I disagree that presence of spaces such as
electrical/mechanical rooms, corridors, stairs, multi-purpose rooms, etc.
automatically means that this is not a residential building type. It is hard
to imagine a dormitory, hotel, motel, or multifamily without these, and
System 7/8 is hardly an appropriate baseline for such spaces (there would
have to be a system modeled for each floor).  

You should also remember that only the area of conditioned spaces as defined
in 90.1 Section 3 is counted when determining baseline system type (G3.1.1),
so spaces like electrical/mechanical or storage may not have to be factored
in. 

Thanks,

Maria

Hi all,

Thank you for your responses thus far.

I did a quick calculation of the areas. Total Residential Floor area is
approx. 75,000 sq. ft. and total Non-residential  is approx. 50,000 sq. ft.
The Non-residential areas include the basement, main floor multi-purpose
rooms, lobbies, storage etc, and the common corridors, elec, janitor,
lounge/study areas on Floors 2-9.

So if we are in agreement that the Residential areas are to use either
System 1 or System 2, the next question is what are the Non-residential
areas classified as? From Table G3.1.1A it appears the number of floors take
precedence over the floor area, so as the Non-residential area extends over
10 floors, it should be classified as System 7 or System 8. Am I correct in
saying that the number of floors takes precedence over the floor area?

Thanks again for your help and guidance.

Cheers

D?nal

Per the exception noted by Mr Dirkes, I would model the Baseline building
based on Table G3.1.1A; except with the dorm rooms, modeled them with System
1 or 2. 

 

Here is how I come to this decision:

 

*	Since your dormitory building contains some non-residential space
types, you shouldn't use the building type to determine your Baseline, ie
it's no longer truly a residential building type
*	Dorm rooms still fall under the residential space type, so use
residential Baseline systems (1 or 2) for those spaces
*	"Other building and space types are considered nonresidential"  This
statement allows the rest of the building to be modeled per standard
baseline (area, # of floors, energy source).

 

I see the same thought process applies to the mixed-use
(commercial/apartments) as well.  With the rise of mixed-use commercial
building, I'm sure we'll be seeing this type of scenario more often.  I
welcome any comments or suggestions.

 

Thanks,

However
..

The notes in that table clarify as shown below.  I think the notes indicate
that Donal?s ?predominant? building type is residential.  It sounds as
though there are some ?non-predominant? types as well.  Take a look at
G3.1.1?s Exceptions for a description of those.

 

>From 90.1-2007 Table G3.1.1A:

Notes:

Residential building types include dormitory, hotel, motel, and multifamily.
Residential space types include guest rooms, living quarters, private living
space, and sleeping quarters. Other

building and space types are considered nonresidential

Dear Bldg Sim,

I'm looking for guidance on the definition of a University Dormitory
building that I'm modeling under LEED 2009, particularly referencing Table
G3.1.1A Baseline HVAC System Types. The building has 9 storeys above grade
with an underground basement, with a total floor area of approx. 125,000 sq.
ft.

The Basement is primarily crawlspace, electrical, mechanical, student
storage etc.

The Main Floor consists of a number of multi-purpose rooms, further storage
facilities for bicycles, recycling etc, with 1/3 of the main floor plan
dedicated to student residences.

The remaining floors, 2 - 9, are student residences with a number of break
out/study rooms/lounge areas on each floor.

Is the building classified as "Residential", or is it considered
"Nonresidential and More than 5 floors or > 150,000 sq. ft" due to the
basement and main floor spaces not being "Residential"? Will I have to model
the basement and the main floor separate from floors 2-9?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Cheers

D?nal

Dear colleagues,

Over the next two decades, the UN expects that we need to accommodate new homes for 1.7 billion city dwellers. There is an undeniable need for concepts and solutions that lead to more sustainable urban growth, concepts that work across a range of climates and cultures. What are those solutions? Are there good examples? How can we evaluate them on a large scale? What role can computer based environmental performance analysis play in this context?

It is my pleasure to invite you to an all-day symposium on Sustainable Urban Design - Case Studies and Design Workflows<http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/projects/SustainableUrbanDesignSymposium> on May 6th 2013 at MIT. The symposium is supported by the MIT Energy Initiative, MIT's new Center for Advanced Urbanism and the German American Chamber of Commerce Inc. During the morning session speakers from practice and academia will present examples and workflows of how to implement measures of sustainability in their projects. During the afternoon session we will be presenting Umi<http://urbanmodellinginterface.ning.com/>, our new urban modeling platform to evaluate operational energy use, daylighting, outdoor comfort and walkability at the neighborhood level. Umi has been extensively used in two graduate level classes at MIT and Harvard and student projects resulting from these classes will be presented in a poster sessions in the late afternoon. During the closing discussion we hope to develop a better understanding of the role computational design tools may play in the transition to more sustainable urban planning practices.

If you decide to attend, please RSVP<http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/projects/SustainableUrbanDesignSymposium/rsvp.html> by April 15th.

Best regards,

Christoph

Varkie,

I'm not sure what you mean about "EnergyPlus Weather", since EPW is just 
a file format that is not specific to weather data themselves.  TMY3 is 
a type of weather data and released in a CSV format, but it can also be 
converted to TMY2, EPW, BIN, etc.   The EnergyPlus Weather web site 
contains a lot of files from various sources that's all been converted 
to EPW.   There's probably a weather file for Singapore there, but I 
haven't bothered to check.  There's plenty of weather data for Singapore 
done by people there or others, such as ASHRAE  IWEC and IWEC2.
E-mail me if you still need help.

Joe

My two cents.

 

1)      Is the change an admission that the previous requirement could
lead to an inefficient baseline system? Yes. 

2)      Are you justified in "exploiting" it to achieve high energy
savings? Yes. 

 

These are the rules of the game. Sometimes they benefit the baseline
system, sometimes they benefit the proposed system. 

 

If that doesn't make you feel comfortable, you could always see if there
was a specific addendum to 90.1-2007 where that change was made and
"elect" to apply that addendum in its entirety to your model.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] VAV Minimum Flow Setpoint and Supply Air Temperature
Reset in ASHRAE 90.1-2007

 

Hello,

 

I am doing an ASHRAE 90.1-2007 PRM analysis for a LEED 2009 CS project,
credit EAc1. The baseline system is System 7 - VAV with Reheat.

 

Appendix G has the following requirements for System 7:



 

In keeping with the above requirements, when the temperature is satisfied
in any zone, I am supplying 0.4 cfm/ft2 at 59F (54F + 5F reset). This is
causing many zones to be overcooled and, therefore, reheated. The result
is that I have a significant amount of simultaneous heating and cooling in
my baseline model. Section 6.5.2.1 states that reheating, recooling and
simultaneous heating/cooling is not allowed unless the air volume is no
greater than 0.4 cfm/ft2 (or the larger of 0.4 cfm/ft2, the ventilation
requirement, 30% of max flow, etc.). Therefore, my baseline is allowed to
overcool and reheat since it is running at 0.4 cfm/ft2.

 

My proposed model does not have this problem as it is allowed to go below
0.4 cfm/ft2 and it is allowed to reset by more than 5F. I am achieving
unreasonably high savings as a result of this issue.

 

What I find interesting is that G3.1.3.13 has been revised for ASHRAE
90.1-2010 to the following:



 

The minimum is no longer an absolute 0.4 cfm/ft2 but a relative 30% of
zone peak air flow. In mild or heating dominated climates 30% of zone peak
air flow can be much less than 0.4 cfm/ft2.

 

By changing the requirement for 90.1-2010 is this an acknowledgement by
ASHRAE that the previous requirement could lead to an inefficient baseline
model? Am I justified in exploiting it to achieve high savings?

 

Thank you!

Hi Maria,
The predominant condition is determined only by conditioned area not gross
floor area.I feel the common spaces such as corridors,stairs etc should be
considered as residential or non-residential depending space type/floor it
serves.If these common spaces such as corridors,stairs etc are
unconditioned then no problem it doesn't affect the baseline system
selection.
Baseline System Selection:
 If the conditioned area of both residential and non-residential space is
greater than 20,000sf then the project is eligible for G3.1.1 exceptions
a.Otherwise if either of the space type conditioned area is less than
20,000sf system selection is based on predominant conditioned area.

Cheers,
Dhayanandh

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How to model a district ice-storage system using option2?
Message-ID: <7d6b1788.9016.13e0cb35a91.Coremail.e2fye2@163.com>

Dear modelers,
I'm simulating several buildings using district cooling for LEED certificate. The district cooling plants are ice-storage plants.
The "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2 and LEED 2009 ? Design & Construction" specify that a virtual plant should be used to represent the district cooling plants performance. However, general virtual plant operate in day time, which cannot reflect the advantage of ice-storage system. 
I have two questions about it.
1 If the default efficiency of chiller is used in the virtual cooling plant, shall I also construct an ice-storage system in the proposed case? I did this in the first submission, and the reviewer did not reject it. I wonder if it is acceptable, because no guidance is given in the "Treatment V2" of this condition.
2 Appendix C of the "Treatment V2" said that if the efficiency of the district plant would like to be input as it is, the efficiency of the district cooling plants should be modeled or monitored. If modeling method is used, I really question how this should be carried out. How the load is determined or modeled? How the ice-storage performance of the virtual plant be identical with the district plants?
Thanks for your suggestions!
Esmi

Message-ID: <5981a70d.10c6b.13e10882f1d.Coremail.e2fye2@163.com>

Dear all,
When simulating district cooling for LEED, a virtual plant is required to be added to the proposed building, according to the "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2 and LEED 2009 ? Design & Construction".
The efficiency of the virtual plant is obtained through modeling if the district cooling system is new.
The "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2 and LEED 2009 ? Design & Construction" said, "Apply measured or estimated load profiles as ?process loads? to reflect the estimated total loads on the district energy plant".
My question is:
What is the estimated load? If the district cooling system provides cold to any other buildings that are not in the LEED certificate scope, how can I get the estimated load? 

Regards,
Esmi

First off, I have no idea...

But I would start with the load profile of a building representative of 
the median or average age of the buildings on the system, even if I had 
to build the model.  Then I would apply that to the central plant, 
scaled up to the capacity of the central plant, or where you think the 
capacity factor falls.  If I was doing this in Energy Pro, which I use 
most often, I might build a "typical" model building and add it to the 
model of the proposed building (all being heated and cooled by the 
central plant), with an appropriate multiplier to use up the capacity of 
the central plant, minus the new proposed building, on a design day.  I 
would then consider leaving those "bogey buildings" in the model as I 
proceeded forward.  Perhaps (just perhaps) calling them "existing" might 
allow the software to ignore them for the LEED calculations.

You could also find out what other buildings are on the system, and 
model those.  Probably more accurate than just a "typical building".  If 
you modeled all the buildings being provided heating and cooling by the 
central plant, that would be a pretty good way to go.


But, like I said, I have no idea.

Dear all,
In the eQuest output file, can we know the produced cold or heat?
I would like to calculate the comprehensive efficency of the cooling system. The power consumption of the cooling system, including chiller, pumps etc., is easy to get. But the generated cold of the cooling system cannot be found. 
I tried to use the total cooling energy in ?PS-A Plant energy utilization?, or cooling energy sum in "SS-D Building HVAC load summary", but the they are not equal to each other.
Can anybody give some light on it?
Thanks!

According to the DOE-2.1E manual, page C.131, the TOTAL COOLING LOAD in the PS-A report is 
"the total of the values shown in the SS-D report plus tank and circulation loop losses; 
it represents the cooling energy needed each month".

Dear all,
I wonder how to set the COP of a chiller as constant? after I set the chiller type, the electric input ratio type is determined, which means the self-made constant curve cannot be input.
Thanks!

I would agree with that.

I would recommend informing your client that you can either do Option 1 of the USGBC DESv2.0 guidelines (i.e. plants modeled as neutral between baseline and proposed via stipulated rates), or using the stipulated efficiencies for Option 2.

Otherwise, I would recommend informing your client that modeling the entire district system just to estimate the plant efficiencies (i.e. includes buildings outside the scope of the current project), with the goal of getting more EAc1 points for the project, will result in you asking for additional fee because this is additional work on your part, potentially a lot of additional work.  I think this is a very reasonable approach.

Esmireta,

It has been awhile since I modeled a central plant for a LEED project, so you'll have to verify my comments.

After applying a CHW meter and a Steam Meter to your CHW Loop and HW Loop respectively, a new Central Plant can be modeled in either of the following ways:


1)    Using efficiencies per section 2.4.1.2.3 Default Efficiencies and applying them to your meters, or

2)    Using efficiencies per the design specifications and applying them to your meters.

I don't remember ever seeing a 'process load' that must be applied to the plant. I'm sure some else will chime in a correct me if I'm wrong. Have a great day!

Thanks,

Subject: [Equest-users] How the get the "estimated load profile"?

Dear all,
When simulating district cooling for LEED, a virtual plant is required to be added to the proposed building, according to the "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2 and LEED 2009 - Design & Construction".
The efficiency of the virtual plant is obtained through modeling if the district cooling system is new.
The "Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2 and LEED 2009 - Design & Construction" said, "Apply measured or estimated load profiles as "process loads" to reflect the estimated total loads on the district energy plant".
My question is:
What is the estimated load? If the district cooling system provides cold to any other buildings that are not in the LEED certificate scope, how can I get the estimated load?
Regards,
Esmi

Message-ID: <3fda3642.788d.13e16c7318b.Coremail.e2fye2@163.com>

Dear all,
In a district cooling using ice-storage project, the baseline building is required to meter energy consumption separately in peak time and off peak time, as the proposed building.
In the proposed case, I use a virtual chiller to produce ice during off peak time, thus, it is easy to meter the peak energy consumption and off peak consumption by set different elec. meters on different chillers.
Now the baseline is also required to meter the energy consumption separately. I wonder if there is any method to directly meter the energy consumption during different time for ONE chiller.
Thanks!

Message-ID: <CAOyQK8YaT=zHr688SEmJu6GMYKfTb57M6h-2nmP_dTF6PDEnuw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on a project that involves an expansion and a major renovation
of an existing building. My question relates to LEED modeling of the
existing building under LEED-NC.

The issue is that the existing building is significantly over-ventilated.
My team is involved in an energy retrofit of the existing structure and
intends to bring the OA rate down significantly. However because of the
equal vent rate requirement in Appendix-G, it seems like this won't lead to
any energy credit. As I understand it, no matter what we drop the vent rate
to (or even if we raised it), the proposed building will have to match and
the ventilation improvement will go unrecognized.

In case that's not clear, say the current building has 10,000 cfm of OA,
but we're going to drop that to 5,000 cfm with the new design.  This leads
to significant heating and cooling savings. Can the baseline have 10,000
cfm because it's an existing building, or must it match under all
circumstances?

Not unrecognized, the owner will save lots of energy which should be recognized.

They should do that part regardless of LEED.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How to set the loop loss as 5 or 10%?
Message-ID: <7fda0ac9.32ef.13e1ae2bbe9.Coremail.e2fye2@163.com>

Dear all,
As required by the district thermal energy guidance, the loop loss should be 5% for the cooling loop and 10% for the heating loop.
However, there is only DT input for the loop loss option panel. If the supply and return temperature difference is 40 F for the heating loop, the loss should be 4 F. But after I set the loss DT as 4F, the heating energy consumption will increase heavily, even 3 times of the orginal heating energy consumption.
So I wonder how it works. Does anybody have experience on it?
Thanks!

Hi Mitchell,
Thanks for your reply!
I really don't know how the DT work. Why a little DT can give a huge rise in the energy consumption?
Further, will the GBCI reviewer question the way of setting DT to represent the loop loss? Did you give any specific explanation on the DT, or just leave it without narrative?
Thanks!
Esmi

If your client actually meters the chilled water usage at the buildings and
allocates the charges to each facility for the cost of producing chilled
water you can use that information and just set the model up in baseline
and proposed building like any other metered utility with a cost per btu,
Kbtu, ton-hours, etc. There would be no need to model a central plant at
all in this case.
I believe the rule is that the proposed building has to be less than 50% of
the load on the central plant. You would need to verify that in the LEED
documentation.

My experience has been that the ventilation rates do have to match between
models when it comes to LEED.

 

The rule is a bit short-sighted because, in reality, there are potentials
for energy savings from reduced OA just based on system type. For example, a
DOAS will have lower total OA than a typical VAV system. My initial
submission of a project using this argument was rejected, though, because
the OA values did not match between the two models.

if you're using dcv in the proposed model the ventilation rates are 
allowed to be different if the dcv use is not required by section 
6.4.3.8, but if you're not using dcv the oa rates are to be the same.

Esmireta,

I've always provided a narrative to support this. The last two campus projects I've dealt with directly had two different resolutions.

1.       Project A: Modeled the virtual plant based on the equipment efficiencies following the District Thermal Modeling Guidelines. In this case, the heat loss from the campus piping distribution was assigned as a delta-T as loss to the tunnel. A narrative was provided to explain the total CHW & Steam consumption before adding the heat loss, and the consumption after applying the heat loss. I assume similar parameters, as you describe, by multiply the distribution DT by 10% for the tunnel losses - however, the results were much greater than a 5% or 10% increase in energy use for that component. I reviewed the summary of plant equipment reports and found the part load performance was completely different from the model without a DT factor applied. It appeared as though the plant was trying to accommodate for these loads so the equipment DT's were operating at higher ranges, thus changing factors for exiting CHW temperature and the LIFT. I didn't have much more time than to dig deeper, but adjust the DT down until the 5%/10% thresholds were achieved and explained this to the reviewer.

2.       Project B: Ended up using actual metered consumption of the CUP/CHP to build a spreadsheet of the total energy consumed for BTUs delivered. I was trying to model this approach, but it got very convoluted, and ultimately had a review with the GBCI review team and Gail Hampsmire from the GBCI. This was very productive and helped us forge ahead with a simple resolution of using a spreadsheet based calculation apportioning the real campus energy use meters to prorate kWh/therms for each building. Bottom line is if you are having a difficult time communicating with the review team, see about having a short call with Gail to help work through open issues and determine a path forward. She's been incredibly helpful for multiple items we've encountered.

Hi Mitchell,
Thanks for your reply!
I really don't know how the DT work. Why a little DT can give a huge rise in the energy consumption?
Further, will the GBCI reviewer question the way of setting DT to represent the loop loss? Did you give any specific explanation on the DT, or just leave it without narrative?
Thanks!
Esmi

Dear all,
As required by the district thermal energy guidance, the loop loss should be 5% for the cooling loop and 10% for the heating loop.
However, there is only DT input for the loop loss option panel. If the supply and return temperature difference is 40 F for the heating loop, the loss should be 4 F. But after I set the loss DT as 4F, the heating energy consumption will increase heavily, even 3 times of the orginal heating energy consumption.
So I wonder how it works. Does anybody have experience on it?
Thanks!
Esmi

Message-ID: <5AC5086A21584DCD9F8D74A041C0C5CA@MRENG.local>

Hi,

 

Should Multiple Zone systems in the MNECB Reference building have Supply Air
Temperature reset?  

 

I?ve always used it because I know EE4 has the cooling coil reset for
reference buildings in DOE2.1E (COOL-CONTROL = WARMEST).  

 

The reason I ask is because Table 5.4.1.B of the MNECB Performance
Compliance for Buildings says ?Supply air temperature from secondary system
to terminal units is constant at 13?C (55?F).? for Multiple Zone Systems.
The sentence still exists in the 2011 NECB.

 

Thanks,

Aaron

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Insulate the roof in summer without HVAC system yes or
	no?
Message-ID: <95F0356A0810C44AB56ADD48FA44184101DF23F3@greengo>

Hi all

 

I have a project where I need to model a maintenance hangar,

 

In this project we are evaluating the relevance of insulate the roof to
improve the comfort level in summer. The hangar has no air conditioned
system but we use natural ventilation which seems to work well in our
model (we use IES VE).

 

The problem came when we try to put some insulating material to the
actual roof (which is composed of only metal sheet of 2 cms). Unlike one
might expect the temperature in the hangar increases, as the roof
temperature.

 

This is to some extent logic, and I know it depends of the insulate type
and thickness. But we agree (I think) that at least one insulation with
les of 2cm to the actual roof should give an improvement in at least
roof or air temperature. I know that insulation can serve as a "trap" of
interior thermal conditions, so it's improve HVAC systems performance.
But also it serves to avoid the external conditions gets-in.

 

I have tried several configurations without success, internal, external
insulation. 

 

And maybe some of you have already some experience in model this kind of
configuration. We agree (I think) that I can't recommend to my architect
that he shouldn't insulate its roof, but also I want to explain the
pertinence of this with a dynamic thermal modeling.

 

Thanks in advance for any advice on this,

 

David Garcia

Dear community,

I?ve just finished some LEED Energy Modelling for a building in Sao Paulo and I came across some results that made me a bit sceptical. I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on the matter.

Description of the model:

Our proposed building has 30% less Energy Demand than the Baseline building.
The proposed building uses a fan coil system with minimum fresh air provision. The baseline model utilises a PFP VAV system (no.8 according to ASHRAE classification).
Fresh air flow rates between Baseline and Proposed buildings are the same ? i.e. around 7.5l/s/p.
Both Buildings have heat recovery and similar SFPs.
The proposed building uses a rather mediocre Air Cooled chiller ? COP of 2.8 -  whilst the baseline building uses a highly efficient Water Cooled Chiller ? COP of 5.5.

The problem:

The proposed building?s auxiliary energy Consumption is around 80kWh/m2, whilst the Baseline?s  auxiliary  energy consumption is  around 400kWh/m2 ? i.e. 500% more. Does this sound normal? What kind of auxiliary energy consumption (kWh/m2) is reasonable for a VAV system with PFPs doing 7.5l/s/p fresh air? Of course there will be some recirculation from the economiser, but can this justify 5 times more energy spend on auxiliary?

Regards
Ioannis

Hi,

 

Thanks for your answer. Yes we have strong internal gains in this hangar (we suppose a high rate of lighting gain and a heavy occupant metabolism). But, for me is still very strange the fact that we supposed to have natural ventilation who it supposed to help control this strong gain. 

 

Even if air temperature is high, the roof temperature is also higher with insulation that without insulation.

 

Maybe modeling results are "correct" but one might expect that the temperature of wall should get reduced by using a very thin film of insulation. Despite the fact of the strong internal gains which are the same in both examples,

 

This is a difficult case, where you wonder if the "dynamic model" is in a different sense of "reality"

 

Bes regards and thanks again,

 

David GARCIA-SANCHEZ

Insulation does trap heat and this is a real issue that happens in the real
world and not just in models.  There was a thread on this form last year
about it and papers posted.  I would suggest you look into phase change
materials rather then insulation- they will absorb the energy and cool the
space down to enhance comfort during the day and release that heat into the
space at night to keep it warm. There is a video of a metal building
install at this link--->
http://www.phasechange.com/index.php/en/install-portfolio/videos

In addition to PCM's I suggest you look into high emissivity / reflectivity
paints or coatings.

David,

I must admitt that it?s really extrange what it's happening to you. But the
only explanation is the SRI that it may change when you change the roof
composition. A metal sheet can easy have a SRI 0.6 and cement unpainted 0.2.

In a way it?s true that when you have a building with high internal load
and no HVAC system when you increased the insulation level in the envelope
the interior temperature normally gets high. (In the same way that
insulation dont let external heat get in, it doesnt allow internal heat
gets out). But in this cases it?s always recomended to keep the roof
insolation high.

Good luck!

Depending on your climate, you may find a CoolRoof may add more value than insulation.  There are some products that claim very high solar reflectance (90%+) combined with high long wave emissivity (.92+) which can keep the roof itself cool thus reducing the sub-roof temperature and under some conditions creating a negative heat pump effect due to sky cooling that occurs in the daytime.  There are a number of products out there that use a ceramic nanospehere particle additive to the roof paint that lifts solar reflectance by 15-20%.  So when applied to a TiO2 white you can get into the 90%'s.

If your climate is cooling dominated you may find this a useful strategy.  If you have a cold climate then this can work against you but it sounds like cooling is the problem.

Melbourne Airport has successfully used such a product so I don't believe there are any concerns with the high diffusing reflectance around airports.

Most software packages will model a truly cool roof properly including IES-VE and the DOE-2.2 / E+ engines.  The problem is they don't represent more conventional and absorptive roofs which create a roof micro-climate that is biased upwards from ambient.  I am digressing, but thought I would promote this issue a bit as I would love our industry software to recognise this microclimate effect so that we drive better roof designs.  And where we have cooling equipment and outdoor air intakes at roof level, that we have the mechanisms to account for the higher condensing temperatures and higher ventilation air temperatures.  The issues are particular to large roofs like shopping centres, airports, manufacturing facilities etc.  I wrote a paper on this (attached) to try and give this issue some visibility.  Please keep asking your software vendors for these issues to be represented in your software fully ...

Also with your hangar do you have the space stratified?  While you can stratify in IES-VE and get an indication of annual bulk conditions, it would be best tested in CFD using IES-VE to get your boundary conditions if you are interested in more than just every, i.e. comfort.

Dear Rut,
Thanks for your reply!
In my opinion, Q=m*cp*delta_t. During the transport of cold water, there is no mass loss, so m stay constant, and assume cp is constant. Assume the thermal loss=delta_Q, then, delta_Q=m*cp*delta_t1. Because delta_Q=10%*Q, then, delta_t1=10%*delta_t.
I think the above method is reasonable.
But why the delta_t1 will cause a lot of more energy?
Thanks!
Esmi

I've come across the same scenario before.  I would say Mitchell's method is a reasonable way to go.  


Additionally, the 10% loss in Temp (F) should be not equal to 10% in Thermal energy (Btu/h).  This is most likely why you see huge spike in energy consumption.  You'd have to identify the thermal property of the CHW and HW at the supply temp (in Btu/h), and determine the loss in Btu/h that is equal to 10%.  If there is no loop loss Btu/h input, you could back-calculate the reduced Btu/h in water to determine the DT.

Hi Mitchell,
Thanks for your reply!
I really don't know how the DT work. Why a little DT can give a huge rise in the energy consumption?
Further, will the GBCI reviewer question the way of setting DT to represent the loop loss? Did you give any specific explanation on the DT, or just leave it without narrative?
Thanks!

Dear all,
As required by the district thermal energy guidance, the loop loss should be 5% for the cooling loop and 10% for the heating loop.
However, there is only DT input for the loop loss option panel. If the supply and return temperature difference is 40 F for the heating loop, the loss should be 4 F. But after I set the loss DT as 4F, the heating energy consumption will increase heavily, even 3 times of the orginal heating energy consumption.
So I wonder how it works. Does anybody have experience on it?
Thanks!
Esmi

Graham,
I have only skimmed the paper so far, but the hypothesis is one makes a lot of common sense.  I never gave the roof micro-climate much thought while using EnergyPlus, but I have personal experience of roof-mounted cooling equipment under-performing due to the roof's elevated temperature in the vicinity of an air-cooled condenser.  Thanks for bring the two parts of my brain together!
p.s. a full reading of your paper will follow in the next few days.

Esmi,

I have made the same conclusion before, but the increase in energy consumption was unreasonably high, as you've observed; thus, prompting further look.  However, in eQUEST I have the alternative in inputting Loop Loss in Supply Loss UA, in addition to Loss dT.

Without knowing how your model was set up, it's hard for me to speculate any further on the energy+costs increase.

If you can determine the energy consumption of the district/primary loop, then continue to adjust your Loop Loss deltaT until the additional 10% is met per Mitchell's suggestion.  You can document the results to provide to LEED for supporting docs.

Good luck,

Rut

Dear Rut,
Thanks for your reply!
In my opinion, Q=m*cp*delta_t. During the transport of cold water, there is no mass loss, so m stay constant, and assume cp is constant. Assume the thermal loss=delta_Q, then, delta_Q=m*cp*delta_t1. Because delta_Q=10%*Q, then, delta_t1=10%*delta_t.
I think the above method is reasonable.
But why the delta_t1 will cause a lot of more energy?
Thanks!
Esmi

Additionally, the 10% loss in Temp (F) should be not equal to 10% in Thermal energy (Btu/h).  This is most likely why you see huge spike in energy consumption.  You'd have to identify the thermal property of the CHW and HW at the supply temp (in Btu/h), and determine the loss in Btu/h that is equal to 10%.  If there is no loop loss Btu/h input, you could back-calculate the reduced Btu/h in water to determine the DT.

Hi Mitchell,
Thanks for your reply!
I really don't know how the DT work. Why a little DT can give a huge rise in the energy consumption?
Further, will the GBCI reviewer question the way of setting DT to represent the loop loss? Did you give any specific explanation on the DT, or just leave it without narrative?
Thanks!

Dear all,
As required by the district thermal energy guidance, the loop loss should be 5% for the cooling loop and 10% for the heating loop.
However, there is only DT input for the loop loss option panel. If the supply and return temperature difference is 40 F for the heating loop, the loss should be 4 F. But after I set the loss DT as 4F, the heating energy consumption will increase heavily, even 3 times of the orginal heating energy consumption.
So I wonder how it works. Does anybody have experience on it?
Thanks!
Esmi

Message-ID: <89B4FB2D5DE7614EB31CD320ED524958CD324D1072@TOR-SVR-EX5.mcw.com>

Hello,

We have an EE4 model that we wish to check against NECB. Can anyone suggest a procedure for this?

My initial thought was to create a second model, where the Proposed Building is manually set to match the NECB requirements, then compare the original Proposed Building to the NECB Proposed Building.

However, I am wondering if I can manually modify the Reference Building to match the NECB requirements using a DOE work-around.

Thank you,

Creating a second EE4 Proposed building as the Reference case would 
get around having to modify the Reference case .DOE file.  If you 
modify the .DOE reference file, you have to run the file from the 
command line.  Matching the Reference case HVAC systems requirements 
will be the biggest challenge, see Table 8.4.4.8.A and Table 8.4.4.8.B.

Hell Brian,

In NECB there a procedure for reference case in section 8.
You will have to model using either eQuest, 
CanQuest or EE4 a reference case with section 8 
procedure to compare with the proposed.

Soon we should have a CanQuest version that will compare to NECB

Hope this help

Martin

Subject: [Bldg-sim] FW: Apparent error on ASHRAE 90.1-2007 (and perhaps 2010)

Dear forums,
I think I have discovered an error in the SI version of ASHRAE 90.1 regarding fan power for Baseline Systems 1 & 2.  I sent the message below to ASHRAE, but then thought, "Perhaps someone else has also noticed this and received some guidance from ASHRAE".  Regardless, if it is actually an error, it's worth mentioning to all of you so that you can be aware of it.
Please  let me know if you are aware of this, and how you have dealt with the discrepancy.  My plan is to use the IP formula because it allows more fan power :).

Subject: Apparent error on ASHRAE 90.1-2007 (and perhaps 2010)

Dear ASHRAE,
I am comparing Appendix G fan power calculations for ASHRAE 90.1 in both SI and IP units.  It appears that they do not agree for Baseline Systems 1 & 2.
The formulae for Systems 1 & 2 are:
(IP): Pfan (watts) = CFMs (cfm) * 0.3
(SI): Pfan (watts) = CFMs (L/s) * 0.3

Calculating fan power for Systems 1&2:
Given:
L/s * 1000 = m3/s
m3/s * 2118.64 = cfm

Substituting these into the fan power equations for Baseline Systems 1 & 2:
(SI): (1 L/s * 1000) * .3 = 300 W
(IP): 2118.64 cfm * .3  = 636 W

The fan power should be identical, but isn't even close! Have you ever noticed this?  I could not find an errata sheet that corrected the formula. Will you please check to see if there is a correction?  Please make a correction if I am not missing something!
Thank you!

p.s., In a smaller way, the fan power calculations do not agree for the other System types.  This appears to be due in part to using 5 digit precision for IP units and 4 digits for SI (e.g., 0.00094 for IP and 0.0015 for SI)  If you use SI factors of 0.0014857 and 0.0020547 for Systems 3-4 and 5-8 respectively, the agreement is better.

Fabiano,
It's encouraging that they noticed something, however I don't think the math works properly with the formula you sent.
(SI): (1 L/s * 1000) * .14 = 140 W (This is 1 m3/s)
(IP): 2118.64 cfm * .3  = 636 W  (This is also 1 m3/s)

A factor of .636 seems to work better.

Hey Jim,



I think you are right.



0.3 x CFM = W



0.3 x (L/S) /0.472 = W



thus



0.636 x L/S = W





Thanks,

Marcin

Forgot to say:
A factor of .636 seems to work better.
(SI): (1 L/s * 1000) * .636 = 636 W (This is 1 m3/s)
(IP): 2118.64 cfm * .3  = 636 W  (This is also 1 m3/s)

Fabiano,
It?s encouraging that they noticed something, however I don?t think the math works properly with the formula you sent.
(SI): (1 L/s * 1000) * .14 = 140 W (This is 1 m3/s)
(IP): 2118.64 cfm * .3  = 636 W  (This is also 1 m3/s)

Assunto: [EnergyPlus_Support] FW: Apparent error on ASHRAE 90.1-2007 (and perhaps 2010)

Dear forums,
I think I have discovered an error in the SI version of ASHRAE 90.1 regarding fan power for Baseline Systems 1 & 2.  I sent the message below to ASHRAE, but then thought, ?Perhaps someone else has also noticed this and received some guidance from ASHRAE?.  Regardless, if it is actually an error, it?s worth mentioning to all of you so that you can be aware of it.
Please  let me know if you are aware of this, and how you have dealt with the discrepancy.  My plan is to use the IP formula because it allows more fan power :).

Subject: Apparent error on ASHRAE 90.1-2007 (and perhaps 2010)

Dear ASHRAE,
I am comparing Appendix G fan power calculations for ASHRAE 90.1 in both SI and IP units.  It appears that they do not agree for Baseline Systems 1 & 2.
The formulae for Systems 1 & 2 are:
(IP): Pfan (watts) = CFMs (cfm) * 0.3
(SI): Pfan (watts) = CFMs (L/s) * 0.3

Calculating fan power for Systems 1&2:
Given:
L/s * 1000 = m3/s
m3/s * 2118.64 = cfm

Substituting these into the fan power equations for Baseline Systems 1 & 2:
(SI): (1 L/s * 1000) * .3 = 300 W
(IP): 2118.64 cfm * .3  = 636 W

The fan power should be identical, but isn?t even close! Have you ever noticed this?  I could not find an errata sheet that corrected the formula. Will you please check to see if there is a correction?  Please make a correction if I am not missing something!
Thank you!

p.s., In a smaller way, the fan power calculations do not agree for the other System types.  This appears to be due in part to using 5 digit precision for IP units and 4 digits for SI (e.g., 0.00094 for IP and 0.0015 for SI)  If you use SI factors of 0.0014857 and 0.0020547 for Systems 3-4 and 5-8 respectively, the agreement is better.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modeling CHP Plants serving Campus DES
Message-ID: <DUB103-W24C719AF41C76011AB9985E0B20@phx.gbl>

Hi all,

I'm looking for guidance on the interpretation of CHP modeling according to Appendix B in the LEED Canada Interpretation Guide for District Energy Systems or Appendix D in the USGBC Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED v2 and LEED 2009 using the Method 2/Option 2 route.

For the project that I'm working on, metered data is available. Annual metered electricity consumption shows that the campus uses 73%
 of the electricity generated by the CHP plant with the remaining 27% 
coming from grid supplied electricity. So, I intend to use this fraction
 and apply it to the total electricity consumption of the proposed 
building. Charge the 27% at the local grid supplied electricity rates 
and charge the remaining 73% CHP generated electricity based on Annual 
Fuel Input Cost to CHP ($)/Annual CHP Electricity Generation (kWh).


Again from metered data, 67% of the heating energy supplied to the 
DES is from the waste heat generated by the CHP plant. The remaining 33%
 is provided by backup boilers using grid supplied natural gas. So 67% 
of the proposed building's heating energy will be "free" with the 
remaining 33% charged based on local natural gas utility rates. I'm setting the proposed boiler efficiency equal to the back up boiler efficiency.


The baseline building heating and electricity consumption will be charged at the local utility rates.

Is this methodology acceptable for the proposed model? I'm not sure if I should be using the formulas provided in the Appendix to calculate CHP Electric Output and CHP Fuel Input? Are these formulas to be used when metered data is not available?


Thanks

D?nal
