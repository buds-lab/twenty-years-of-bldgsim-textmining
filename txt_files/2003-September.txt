Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200309230903.AA0311687pd80000417023@gard.com>

Dear all,

I am facing a new simulation project in Discovery Bay, Hongkong;
therefore I am looking for meteorological data as input data.
I checked the IWEC-site
(http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weatherdata_int.cfm),
but failed.

Can anyone give me an helpfull advice ?  

Thanks,
Gunter P?ltz

EnergyPlus Wins R&D 100 Award

R&D Magazine recently announced that EnergyPlus is one of the winners in
the 41st annual R&D 100 Awards.  The R&D 100 Awards honor the 100 most
technologically significant new products of the year.


OK, But Where Are the Interfaces?

A beta version of the first EnergyPlus user interface, DesignBuilder, is
available now at  www.designbuilder.co.uk

DesignBuilder provides a range of environmental performance data such as:
annual energy consumption, maximum summertime temperatures and heating and
cooling loads as well as detailed feedback on temperatures and heat flows
in the building.  Featuring easy-to-use sketch screen, hierarchical
defaults, facades, customisable templates and data detail, DesignBuilder
can be used effectively at any stage of the design or evaluation process.
DesignBuilder provides an interface to the latest EnergyPlus version for
envelope, solar, ventilation and daylighting capabilities as well as
heating and cooling load modelling.  The software comes with summer and
winter design data for 1439 locations around the world and access to more
than 500 hourly simulation weather files.


Other Interface Tools

Several developers have tools that produce or work with EnergyPlus IDF
files:

www.squ1.com -- Ecotect from Square One couples an intuitive 3D design
interface with a comprehensive set of performance analysis functions
(visualization, solar and daylighting analysis, shadows and shading,
lighting design, thermal performance, UK building regulations, ventilation,
and acoustic analysis) with interactive information displays.  It also can
export an EnergyPlus IDF file.

www.drawbdl.com -- DrawBDL allows users to visually review the building
geometry in DOE-2 input and output files.  DrawBDL can export the DOE-2
surface data in EnergyPlus IDF format?useful for those users who wish to
convert their DOE-2 input files into EnergyPlus input files.

www.deringergroup.com/Software/EPlusTools.htm -- several tools are
available from the Deringer Group: DrawEzPlus is a 3-D geometry rendering
tool that displays the geometry imbedded in an EnergyPlus file. Users can
toggle between line and surface (fill) presentation modes, and can select
to draw any mix of key building objects -- floor, walls, roof, windows, and
attached and detached shading.  EzPlus-Parm simplifies running multiple
parametric EnergyPlus simulations. EzPlus-Parm helps a user to organize and
edit all needed files.  Their EcoAdvisor product also uses EnergyPlus to
perform web-based building energy simulations.

www.tse-inc.net/tseplus -- the first of a suite of tools to manage data for
EnergyPlus is now available free of charge from Taylor Systems Engineering.
TSe+Mat provides an interface to the materials datasets that come bundled
with EnergyPlus and allows the user to add them to a personal database to
maintain and modify for later use.  Future tools under development include
TSe+MatGlz (for materials and glazings) and TSe+Con (for constructions.


What's going on in V1.1.1?

      Will there be any considerable difference between version 1.1.1 and
1.1.0?

      Yes.... and no. There are a number of new features and bug fixes.

      How about IDF and IDD? Do they remain unchanged?

      There will be some changes in the IDD and reflected in IDFs.
Particularly for any new features, there will be      new objects.

      Is version 1.1.1 backward compatible? Can I run v1.1.0 file in v
1.1.1?

      For the most part, the answer is yes. Some report variables have
changed names. To be sure, you can execute      the transition program that
will "transition" IDFs from V1.1.0 to V1.1.1. You can also view the
ObjectStatus      spreadsheet in the root folder of the installed version.
This file has detailed explanations of changes to the       objects.

Mike,

In 1998 we did an extensive amount of modeling and calibration of both 
residential and commercial GSHP systems using v130 as part of a GHPC and 
PG&E funded project. We found the DOE2 ground model to have some 
limitations but in general to be quite good. Let me know if you need more 
details.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Meteorological Data for Brasilia, Brasil


Dear all,

we are facing a simulation project for a building in
the city of Brasilia in Brasil. Therefore we are looking for
good meteorological data as a basis for our simulations.
We know that the software METEONORM delivers meteorological
data, which might be similar to a test reference year (try).
In Addition we are very interested in something like a
"design day" for Brasilia; this data should at least cover
following meteorological data:
1) external air temperature
2) external air humidity
3) global horizontal radiation / direct normal radiation
4) diffusive horizontal radiation
5) wind speed
6) wind direction
7) a.s.o.

Any hints are appreciated.

Regards,
Gunter

Dear all,

we are facing a simulation project for a building in
the city of Brasilia in Brasil. Therefore we are looking for
good meteorological data as a basis for our simulations.
We know that the software METEONORM delivers meteorological
data, which might be similar to a test reference year (try).
In Addition we are very interested in something like a
"design day" for Brasilia; this data should at least cover
following meteorological data:
1) external air temperature
2) external air humidity
3) global horizontal radiation / direct normal radiation
4) diffusive horizontal radiation
5) wind speed
6) wind direction
7) a.s.o.

Any hints are appreciated.

Regards,
Gunter

I suggest that you contact Prof. Roberto Lamberts at the University of Santa
Catarina in Florianopolis, Brazil (lamberts at ecv.ufsc.br), who developed
developed hourly climate data for 14 Brazilian locations back in 1998.  As
someone else has already mentioned, ASHRAE's IWEC is another potential
source of data.

Calvin,

This response is a little late, but hope it might still be of use to you.
"DOE-2 modeling tips" available on line at the LBNL Simulation Research
Group web site (http://gundog.lbl.gov) has a section on modeling underground
surfaces in DOE-2 (pp. 4-14), with several tables of recommended Perimeter
Conduction Factors (Btu/hr-F-ft of perimeter) for 88 different types of
foundations. These are based on analysis of 2-D heat transfer simulation
results I did with Lester Shen back in 1988.  Since the thermal properties
of concrete are similar to that of soil, the difference between 4" and 6"
slab is insignificant. The biggest factors are: (1) the height of the slab
above the soil, (2) the perimeter insulation thickness and depth, (3) the
existence of carpet over the slab, and (4) the assumed properties of the
soil.  What we modeled was a 6" edge, with and without carpet, and wet soil
with a conductivity of 1 Btu/ft2-hr-F.

I am working on an energy code compliance form.  The scope of the project is
some office space being built into an existing warehouse.  The city is
requiring that these offices meet the current energy code.  Which is all
fine, however the existing slab is uninsulated.  Obviously, we can meet a
prescriptive approach.  However, using an overall component method we just
get hammered by the uninsulated slab.  Basically, we need to insulate
everything else as much as possible.  So, any credit in the F-Factor for an
8" slab vs. a 6" slab would be extremely beneficial.  Anyone else deal with
similar requirements/situation?  Would it be possible to insulate an
existing slab?

Thank you everyone for your quick response.  I have found the ASHRAE tables
and none of them apply to my situation.  I have an uninsulated slab that is
8" thick.  All the ASHRAE tables deal with insulated slabs or 6" slabs.

Do the numbers for a 6" slab change significantly when going to an 8" slab?

Dear Gunter, 

check out  http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weatherdata_int.cfm for IWEC data. The data also specifies design days. You should, however, check reliability of the data for a remote place like Brasilia as far as possible.

Dear
  I beleive that the thermal properties such as U-
value, solar transmittance , emmittance and
absorptance and the shading coefficient is dfferent
for both frit glass and the louvers , it is nessacery
to read the industry company' technical brochaure and
calculate the solar heat gain by the thermal
properties values given by it with the help of ASHRRAE
handbook of fundamentals Chapter" Fenestration".

Subject: [bldg-sim] Slab on grade f-factor


Thank you everyone for your quick response.  I have found the ASHRAE tables
and none of them apply to my situation.  I have an uninsulated slab that is
8" thick.  All the ASHRAE tables deal with insulated slabs or 6" slabs.

Do the numbers for a 6" slab change significantly when going to an 8" slab?

Calvin

Subject: [bldg-sim] Solar shading, fritted glass / louvre shading comparison
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200309130309.AA0930390pd80000407623@gard.com>

Dear all,

I have been working on a few projects were we had to deal with excessive
solar gains due to huge areas of facade glazing.
Even so we produced results comparing louvre shading against fritted glass
indicating louvres perform significantly better than frit the architects
came up with arguments picked up somewhere, that fritted facade glazing
performs similar to louvres, with respect to solar gains. The point is, the
facade glazing was requested to be modelled with a percentage frit above
70%.  Still we found the total solar gains to be more than double as high
for the fritted glass compared to the louvre shading option.

Do you guys know by any chance a few papers or articles I could refer to, to
either prove or review my models?! Any of you experienced similar problems
in the past?

Many thanks for your effort in advance!

Christian

Mark,
There is also a product "Airfloor" which creates air plenum under a
poured concrete floor.
The stamped sheet metal forms connect together creating a void under
floor.
See product at:
http://www.sunearth.net/airfloor.html
I am not sure if the Airfloor Systems, Inc. is still in business as
their website is not accessible.

Mark, Bldg-Simmers, 
The UK's Building Research Establishment's "Office of the Future" is one
Euro building that deliberately uses voids formed into precast concrete
floor/ceiling panels to distribute & extract natural ventilation air,
consciously activating their thermal mass.  These proprietary panels
were invented & seem to be most widely used in Scandinavia; they create
an undulating ceiling with ~10' period peak to peak, with 'waves' ~2.5'
deep.  A flat floor is cast above, and air is driven by wind pressure
between this floor slab and the lower ceiling formed by the precast
panels.  Their curving shape lend themselves very well to
direct/indirect lighting fixtures suspended below the high points of the
ceiling;  for both nat vent & daylighting purposes, sections are
oriented perpendicular to the exterior walls. The shapes tend to elicit
that 'WOW' factor from architects....
As I say, these are a proprietary precast system, but the manufacturer's
name escapes me at the moment.  For more information, speak to Feilden
Clegg Architects (London, UK?) or the BRE; David Lloyd Jones' book
"Architecture & the Environment - Bioclimatic Building Design" has both
lovely pictures & (hail Mary!) monitored energy performance #s (83

I'm looking for information on structurally integrated air distribution
systems (for want of a better term). I seem to remember reference to a
building that had the air distribution integrated into the floor slab at
one of JE Braun's presentations on building mass thermal storage. The
idea was to more effectively couple the air system with the building's
thermal mass. I know some related work has been done with raised floor
systems over concrete slabs but that's not really what I'm thinking of. 
I opened my big mouth at a design concept meeting for a local green
project, the architect thought WOW!, and now the engineer wants some
references.  Imagine that. Any references would be appreciated.

Get an 8,760 hourly printout of electric demand from DOE-2.1E, import it
into a spreadsheet, and do the daily rate calc. Or average the calc for the
month within the ECONOMIC portion. I believe you can change the rate 15
times per year within 2.1E..

thermal mass. I know some related work has been done with raised floor
systems over concrete slabs but that's not really what I'm thinking of. 

I opened my big mouth at a design concept meeting for a local green
project, the architect thought WOW!, and now the engineer wants some
references.  Imagine that.
Any references would be appreciated.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200309031030.AA3015765pd80000398042@gard.com>

We need to calculate the steady-state 3-D temperature distribution in the corner 
of a walls/slab in contact with the ground, to demonstrate compliance with 
regulations. We could do this with a general-purpose modelling program such as 
FEMLAB (if we had it), but I'd appreciate some suggestions from anyone who's 
solved this problem with building modeling software.

Dear members:
 
My name is Fernando, from Spain and I have several problems with powerdoe. 
 
One of them is that when I create report blocks and the corresponding
report, I don?t find them after in the list of available reports, so I
cannot see the results I?m looking for.
 
Other problem is that when I try to define the control schedule for the HVAC
system, (I use the Residential one) I don?t know where to do it, if in the
zone thermostat, in the cooling/heating control or in both of them.
 
Thank you very much.

Andrew,

Run the following in DOE-2.1e or DOE-2.2 BDL commands through doebdl.exe to
determine your unique DOE-2 versions limits and defaults. Replace XXX with
whatever command you want to know more details on (SPACE or ZONE in your
case). The resulting BDL echo file will answer your question.

Have fun!

I believe 1000 zones is about right. It all depends on how intense the input
is into each zone. Jeff Hirsch can elaborate more "succinctly". However, you
might want to complete the model before your children grow up, so some
brevity is called for.

Derrick,

You can find brief description of the major building simulation software at
the following link:

http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/

Also I have found the following book very useful for learning and
understanding the theory and concepts of the building simulation.

Clarke J A (2001) Energy Simulation in Building Design (2nd Edn),
Butterworth-Heinemann.

Derrick,
 
In case you're not aware of the papers published by IBPSA (International
Building Performance Simulation Association), you can peruse and
download any number of them from 1989 to the present at
http://www.ibpsa.org <http://www.ibpsa.org/> .  Click on Conferences and
then select a conference year.  These are available at no cost in PDF
format.  The last conference year showing is BS'01.  BS'03 has not been
added yet, but will be available soon.
 
Best regards,
 
Larry Degelman, IBPSA Newsletter Chair.

The Institute for Research in Construction (IRC) of the National Research
Council of Canada (NRC) has released the second beta version of SkyVision.
SkyVision is WindowsTM-based, analysis software that calculates the overall
optical characteristics and daylighting performance of conventional and
tubular skylights, and predicts their energy-saving potential.  SkyVision
accounts for the skylight shape and glazing type, geometry and surface
characteristics of the indoor space, lighting and shading controls, building
site location and prevailing climate.  The main additions to the first beta
version (released in March 2003) include: calculation of the monthly and
annual lighting energy savings, improvement of the Graphical User Interface,
fixes of reported bugs, and more weather files for Canadian cities.   The
final version will be available in summer 2004.  The software can be
downloaded free of charge from the IRC web site:
<http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/skyvision/>.

Comments/suggestions are very useful and appreciated, and can be directed to
Dr. Aziz Laouadi.
