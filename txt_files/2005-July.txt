Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Energy Plus tools
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200507150706.AA0636312pd80000732900@gard.com>

Hello!

I'm a new Energy Plus user and I've some problem to understand what is the best way to use the program..

In the main web site there are a lot of interfaces that allow to manage the whole simulation (create input file and visualize the outpus) or to only edit the IDF file, but I don't understand if using the tools I can access to all the functionality of Energy Plus.

I think that the best way could be to use the IDF editor, but:

a) I don't find any tutorial;
b) I would input the geometry from a dxf file generated by autocad or another GUI tool.

Can someone explain me what is the best way to use the tools for a new user?

Thank's everybody

Hi Gerald,
 
There are primarily two big loads on the system for indoor pools -- 1) evaporation and 2) ventilation. Evaporation amounts to almost 70% of heating load in an indoor pool (it's more than oudoor in many cases, since it does not see the sun and is occupied most of the year). If care isn't taken in conserving energy due to evaporation losses then the ventilation energy would increase for the space!.... that said, there is opportunity for savings and control of the environment. Simply covering the pool to mitigate wind factor and lessen the air-water interaction in non-use hours and not heating the water during those hours are the best way to conserve. 
 
Coming to your question, best way the size a system is to determine the extent of evaporation that will happen. The calculations can be quite cumbersome, but usually in practice corelation models are used to estimate the lb/sft.hr of water evaporated in the space. Once you have (pounds of water per sft per hour) being added to a space, I imagine it should be easy to incorporate that as a latent load in your model. There are some very useful studies available online explaining the correlation models and estimation of the evaporation potential. The one I particularly liked is http://www.hpac.com/microsites/egb/pdfs/shah_0304.pdf that takes into account an inactive pool condition as well as an active pool condition, with the difference between the two being significant. The author also indicates prior studies and correlations (empirical or otherwise) that might be useful incase you don't want to use his. Apparently ASHRAE has one correlation in the Applications handbook that I have not
 looked into as yet.
 
Other resourse useful to you might be the DOE, EERE website and the RSPEC tool:
http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumerinfo/heatcool/hc_pool_heating.html
and finally, I like this following website for it's ease of use and clarity of its explanations, however it might be limiting in its scope:
http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html You may like to look up -- evaporation, saturation vapor pressure and related concepts.
 
Hope this helps,

Hi Gerald,
There could be more accurate way of doing it though...
 You need to calculate pool load that includes makeup water load & evap 
load/surface losses.
Use this output as the internal energy process load in eQUEST. Assign a high 
latent heat gain factor to the space ( 90% may be) and the rest to sensible. 

 But I'm not sure about using heat recovery to heat pools. Hope this helps 
to some extent.

In our opinion it is not possible to model a natatorium in eQuest.

We have developed our own software to model them and compare systems.

Accounting for local differences in electricity-related pollution would be
worthwhile when the source energy "mix" for generation differs from the
national average.


I have seen state-by-state information on power generation energy source
(coal, hydro, nuclear, etc) at the EPRI or Edison Electric web site several
years ago, though I did not access this information before this inquiry. As
I recall, fraction of electricity from coal varied from 90% to less than
10%, with comparable variation in fraction provided by hydro.  Metro area
fractional breakouts are perhaps more pronounced.


Review of the excellent residential end use information
http://enduse.lbl.gov/info/LBNL-40297.pdf and
http://buildingsdatabook.eren.doe.gov/ did not yield regional
building-related pollution information.


Are data available that offer reasonable guidance to select localized
pollution outcomes of electricity consumption in buildings?

Alpana,

 

You might try MOIST, a free software program you can use to calculate
temperature profiles and dew point in wall assemblies. Check out this
URL for details:

 

www.bfrl.nist.gov/863/moist.html
<http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/863/moist.html> .  

 

MOIST is a one-dimensional, steady-state analysis, and there are other
considerations that have to be taken into account when analyzing dew
point. Among them are; seasonal and diurnal variation in wall
temperature and RH; the edge effects of studs, windows and framing; the
dynamics of wetting and drying in a cavity; and how a vapor barrier is
used.

Hi,

 

I was wondering if there is some way of modeling the effect and extent
of the vapor pressure, dew point and condensation within walls?

Alpana,
 
You might try MOIST, a free software program you can use to calculate
temperature profiles and dew point in wall assemblies. Check out this URL
for details:
 
 <http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/863/moist.html> www.bfrl.nist.gov/863/moist.html.

 
MOIST is a one-dimensional, steady-state analysis, and there are other
considerations that have to be taken into account when analyzing dew point.
Among them are; seasonal and diurnal variation in wall temperature and RH;
the edge effects of studs, windows and framing; the dynamics of wetting and
drying in a cavity; and how a vapor barrier is used.

Pedro,
   I am by no means an expert in writing C++ components for TRNSYS but I 
think the problem is in the header file that you need to include in your 
C++ project. The file:

..\Trnsys16\Compilers\Cpp-Mvs2003\Include\trnsys.h

does not include references to all of the TRNSYS utility subroutines that 
are available. You can add a reference to PSYCHROMETRICS following the 
syntax that is shown in the file for communicating between a C++ component 
and the TYPECK subroutine.

If I am incorrect about this, I would appreciate if one of the other TRNSYS 
experts out there would add their thoughts.
Cheers,
   David

You can use the EnergyPlus Weather Converter to make TMY2 files out of
the EPW files.  Then you could use the DOE2 converter to create .bin
files.

Does anyone have any experience using pipes integrated into the building
envelope as solar collectors?  

I am involved in a project in Mexico where the design team would like
to incorporate solar hot water heating as much as possible but don't
like the look of standard commercial solar collectors.  As an
alternative, they are interested in embedding pipes in the roof surface.
 The pipes would be covered in a thin layer of concrete (or possibly
copper roofing).  This is obviously not the most efficient system but
the site receives a lot of sun and there is a large roof area available.
 

Has anyone heard of similar installations?  Any suggestions based on
past experience?  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Catherine

I had more or less the same thoughts as you had - but after reading the FAO document I understand that our Meteorological service standing behind its definition is justified - the problem is of course that in most programs the algorithm used is teh one of ASHRAE.



This is from a FAO document I found in the Net. It justifies the Meteorological Srevice's attitude ...

The actual vapour pressure can be determined from the difference between the dry and wet bulb temperatures, the so-called wet bulb depression. The relationship is expressed by the following equation: 


  ea = e? (Twet) - g psy (Tdry - Twet) (15)


where 


  ea actual vapour pressure [kPa],

  e?(Twet) saturation vapour pressure at wet bulb temperature [kPa],

  g psy psychrometric constant of the instrument [kPa ?C-1],

  Tdry-Twet wet bulb depression, with Tdry the dry bulb and Twet the wet bulb temperature [?C].


The psychrometric constant of the instrument is given by: 


  g psy = apsy P (16)


where apsy is a coefficient depending on the type of ventilation of the wet bulb [?C-1], and P is the atmospheric pressure [kPa]. The coefficient apsy depends mainly on the design of the psychrometer and rate of ventilation around the wet bulb. The following values are used: 

apsy = 0.000662

for ventilated (Asmann type) psychrometers, with an air movement of some 5 m/s,


0.000800 for natural ventilated psychrometers (about 1 m/s),


0.001200 for non-ventilated psychrometers installed indoors.

  I do not think this problem should be ignored.  It is often difficult to get everyone on the same page as to the exact definitions of data items, but it is very important or we'll soon be feeding unknown data into unknown algorithms ...

  ASHRAE algorithms are based on the thermodynamic wet bulb temperature, t* = the temperature of adiabatic saturation.  t* is a unique property of moist air (not dependent on velocity etc.) and is the input data required by most simulation programs.  It can be approximately measured with a psychrometer with a sufficient air flow rate or calculated from the dew point.  From your description, it sounds like the Met service is publishing a wet bulb defined differently than this (?).

  It may be possible to derive t* if you have the details of the Met service instrumentation and/or algorithm.  Alternatively, if the Met service data includes dew point, you should be able to work from that using ASHRAE algorithms.

I do not think this problem should be ignored.  It is often difficult to 
get everyone on the same page as to the exact definitions of data items, 
but it is very important or we'll soon be feeding unknown data into unknown 
algorithms ...

ASHRAE algorithms are based on the thermodynamic wet bulb temperature, t* = 
the temperature of adiabatic saturation.  t* is a unique property of moist 
air (not dependent on velocity etc.) and is the input data required by most 
simulation programs.  It can be approximately measured with a psychrometer 
with a sufficient air flow rate or calculated from the dew point.  From 
your description, it sounds like the Met service is publishing a wet bulb 
defined differently than this (?).

It may be possible to derive t* if you have the details of the Met service 
instrumentation and/or algorithm.  Alternatively, if the Met service data 
includes dew point, you should be able to work from that using ASHRAE 
algorithms.

Regarding your comment that velocities inside buildings are usually low ... 
if a given simulation includes velocity-related algorithms (for comfort 
modeling, perhaps), those would need the true absolute humidity (or some 
variant) as input.  The models would provide velocity adjustments as

For the purposes of modeling residential water heating energy use, 
can anyone suggest a source for annual average water inlet temps 
(from the municipal water system)? 
I've been using the annual average outdoor dry-bulb (offset by a few degrees) 
or estimated shallow ground temperatures in the TMY2 files, but these don't 
seem to give plausible values in cold climates like Alaska 
(annual averages are well below freezing, even at 4m depth). 
(a related question might be how they get piped water in places with ground 
temperatures that low).

Alex, 

Further to Stephen's response, the usual cause of the error is that no
return fan is specified - EE4 and hence DOE-2 assumes that heat recovery is
on the return air for non-distributed systems. For distributed systems, heat
recovery is taken into account by adjusting the amount of outdoor air.

Hi Alex

There are a number of things that could go wrong with heat recovery, all
having roots in DOE-2.1e. If you are using a central air-side system that
relies on reheat to keep zones at temperature (affecting 6 of the 15 systems
in EE4), the zone reheat (especially baseboards) will serve the load before
there is a call for heat recovery. Zonal systems escape this problem. 

On way around the hang-up is to add the zone heat capacity to the central
system and zero out the zone capacity, but that will produce underheated
hours when the fans are off. For CBIP purposes it may be worth submitting a
file that shows the impact of heat recovery, plus the working file that
shows all loads are satisfied, and a spreadsheet that reconciles the two to
give the proper design performance.

Happy 4th of July.

has anyone had a problem with heat recovery in EE4?  If i add heat
recovery to my sytems there is NO impact on energy consumption!  i think
EE4 is only used by folks in canada for CBIP so unfortunately that
probably narrows down who can help me.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200507012227.AA2707546pd80000719969@gard.com>

Joe,

I left phone messages and sent email to people in the Windows group
in 2004 on this issue; nobody ever return my messages.

I then contacted Sue Reilly and Charlie Curcija (see message below);
they confirmed my suspicions that the film coeff's in the report were wrong.
We never claimed the bug was in calculation, but that there was a bug in
the Windows 5 reports; you can see that in the email from me that Mahabir
posted to bldg-sim.  Mike's email also only says it is a bug in the report.

Charlie contacted the W&D group, as well, about the problem and they said it
didn't matter for DOE-2 (see below) ... I corrected that notion as you can see from
the message below.  Again, W&D seems to have ignored my explanation.

There are huge numbers of people using DOE-2.2 and eQUEST and some
still using DOE-2.1E ... but I was told (indirectly, as they - W5 support - did
not bother to reply to me at all) that they only focused on EnergyPlus needs
as that was what people used.

So, now the user community considers it a DOE-2/EnergyPlus issue; that the
problem was ignored due to it being only a DOE-2 issue. That seems to be a
reasonable conclusion based on the actual record, even though it may not
be a correct conclusion.

The claim that the W5 group did not know of the specific DOE-2 issue and that
it was just in the last few months it was raised is incorrect as you can see
from my email below.  Many people have raised this issue with
the group, and it was ignored.  Why it became perceived as political
is obvious to the outside world; the only thing that seemed to get it attended
to now was a user pointing out that it seemed to be political.  

So, making it "political" seemed to be the only thing that got action; maybe that is
a lesson that users will take to heart.

In addition to the hin being wrong, the center of glass u seems to be the
overall u instead.  The combination of the hin and center of glass u value
being incorrect create a VERY bad situation for DOE-2.1E users and
mildly bad situation for 2.2 users.

The info you were given on use of Hin and u-center by DOE-2.1E is
incorrect; 2.1E reads the second line of the table at the bottom of the
Window 5 DOE-2 report and collects the inside and outside h's and
u-center (not u-overall);
these are then used to calculate the "bare glass" u-value (no h's)
which is used by the custom weighting factor calculation.  If the
wrong h's or u are used then the custom weighting factors for the
spaces using that glass will be wrong. Since custom weighting
factors are the default (and very important to the hourly
load calculation) the hourly calculation for those spaces can
be way off.

These values are NOT used for the hourly window conductance
calculation; that is done using a set of therm program routines
contained within the DOE-2 LOADS program, but the LOADS
verification reports also use the U-bare values to report the
overall window U-value as well as the overall wall, facade, and
building u-values. These incorrect values confuse many users
of DOE-2 versions.

I have gotten MANY runs from people using W5 library entires
(which is very common) with badly incorrect space loads due to
this bug. There is no user fix for this problem in 2.1E if the
W5 tables are not corrected so both hin and u-center are
corrected.

  Hi Jeff,

      Attached is a document that details how are surface heat transfer coefficients calculated in W5.  In terms of DOE2 report from W5, I believe that convective portion only for indoor coeff. is reported from W5, which is a bug, but apparently (according to my LBL colleagues), it does not affect DOE 2.1E somehow.  I haven't gotten definitive answer yet, but preliminary it looks that way.  Let me know if I can be of further help.

Bug in Window 5.2Mike, others,



You can regard this e-mail as the "LBNL side of the story" that you've requested. The reasons for our delay in responding are threefold: (1) we needed to investigate the situation thoroughly, (2) provide a solution for any defects, and (3) several of us were tied up at ASHRAE the earlier part of this week. We at LBNL stand behind the WIndow program and look carefully into any reported bugs and mistakes.  Any imputation that we are dallying when we learn of problems, especially for nefarious political reasons (!), is unwarranted and only lowers the level of discourse. 

 

When this problem was first mentioned a few months back, the Window 5 development team was under the mistaken impression that it did not affect the calculations, since DOE-2 strips off the air film coefficients anyway. When it was explained that DOE-2 does this only for the exterior air film, and that the mistake in the interior air coefficient does affect the numbers, the development team started to look into this in more detail and to provide a fix. 

 

We determined that this is purely a reporting defect and not a calculational error in Window 5. Without going into the programming details, suffice it to say that as the results are passed to the DOE-2 W5 file, the radiative portion of the interior film coefficient got left off inadvertently, so that only the convective portion was being reported on Line 53 (0 degree C, 6.71 m/sec wind speed).

 

We also found a small reporting bug in the file produced for EnergyPlus with lines in the Gas Data section that are more than the 132-character limit in the EnergyPlus routine that reads the file. We are now making bug fixes for both of these reporting mistakes in Window 5, and will release a corrected version at the end of July. In the meanwhile, we suggest the following work-around to correct the DOE-2 W5 file produced by the current version of Window 5:

 

The interior air film coefficient is related to the center-of-glass U-factor (Ucog) by the equation  



            Hin,tot = 6.9681*Ucog .0491     (Hin,tot and Ucog both in w/m2K)

 

 

Use this equation to calculate "hin" based on the U-factor listed immediately to the right and substitute it in place of the existing "hin", which contains only the convective portion of the interior air film coefficient.



This correlation is valid for 1 < Ucog < 5.2 W/m2K for windows that don't have a low-e surface facing the room. It is quite uncommon to have a low-e coating facing the room, but in that case the radiative component of the film coefficient will be very different. Otherwise, the error for calculating "hin" based on this equation is < 0.5% from the actual value.

As an example, shown below are the original and corrected lines for a sample DOE-2 W5 file :



Original:

In case there are any awk users out there, I've attached a simple awk script (w4cor.awk) to make these corrections to exsiting DOE-2 W5 file with these reporting errors.  This awk script will automatically change the label on the first line to Window 5.2r (to prevent future confusion), and then make the correction just described. The syntax for running awk in a DOS window is 

   

       awk -f w4cor.awk [input file name] > [output file name]

 

Publicly available versions of awk (or gawk) can be found on the Web by searching for "PC awk downloads". 



w4cor.awk script :



{if (filecount > 0) filecount += 1 } 
{if (substr($0,1,10) == "Window 5.2")
   {
      substr($0,11,1) = "r" 
      filecount = 1
   }
}
{if (filecount == 53)
    {
       begline = substr($0,1,30)
       endline = substr($0,36)
       logUval = log($6)
       hincor = logUval*0.0491
       hin = 6.9681 * exp(hincor)
       printf("%s%5.2f%s\n",begline,hin,endline)
    }
 else
    print $0
}

  Hi All, 

  Anyone using Window 5 (any version) to create custom glazing for DOE2 simulations should be very careful.  There is a bug in the output feature of Window 5 that incorrectly reports the window film coefficients used to calculate the center of glass U-value.  If you use this data in a DOE 2 simulation the calculated center of glass U-value may be off by as much as 40%.  BE CAREFUL and check the output reports to verify glazing performance if you are importing Window 5 performance data.  Apparently Window 4 does not have this problem, it worked fine when I tried it.  

  I have been told that LBNL is aware of the problem but to date has not resolved the issue.  

  I have only heard one side of the story (and would be happy to hear the other) but it seems like this is another chapter in the ongoing saga of DOE2 vs Energy Plus.  I am not saying this is the case, but it is disturbing to think that software bugs in publicly funded software are not getting fixed for political reasons.

  Unfortunately those of us trying to use these tools and can't because of issues like this suffer most. 

  Sincerely, 

  Disgruntled Modeler.

has anyone had a problem with heat recovery in EE4?  If i add heat
recovery to my sytems there is NO impact on energy consumption!  i think
EE4 is only used by folks in canada for CBIP so unfortunately that
probably narrows down who can help me. 

thanks

The problem that I'm running into is that the "save component to
library" command is not a selectable option on my edit menu.  When I
right click on a component to bring up the edit menu, the library
command is "grayed out".  Is there some sort of set up that needs to be
done so that I am able to save the user library?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200507011014.AA1453859pd80000719171@gard.com>

Hi all:

I'm programming an enthalpy recovery unit in C
language for adding it to the users components library
in Trnsys (Trnsys' standard libraries currently only
have sensible heat recovery modules) . For this
purpose I need to use the Trnsys function
PSYCHROMETRICS, which is described in the programmers
manual.
I have no problems to compile my new module in my C++
compiller (Microsoft Visual C++) but when I try to
execute it in Trnsys Studio an error like this occurs:
"Address violation at address 00DE02DD in module
'TRNDLL.DLL'. Read of address 00000002";"An unexpected
error was encountered and Trnsys will abort".
Have you used the PSYCHROMETRICS function in your
modules? Could you explain me what am I doing wrong?
Thanks in advance,
Regards,

Samuel,

I just used eQuest to model an ice storage system and I think your problem 
is how you specify the ice storage priority relative to the chillers.  You 
adjust this in Equipment Controls by assigning the sequence number to the 
ice storage and to the chiller (see HELP info pasted in below).  If you 
want the ice to share the load with the chiller, assign them both to be 
sequence #1.  The amount of load on each device will be based on the 
capacity of each that you specify in this section.

Andy
Sequence
This spreadsheet contains a list of integers that specify the order in 
which the equipment is used to satisfy the load?equipment with higher 
sequence numbers are not turned on until the load cannot be met by the 
previously sequenced equipment.
During any given hour, equipment assigned sequence number 1 turns on first, 
then if the load is not satisfied, the equipment with sequence number 2 
turns on, etc. The equipment listed in the Boiler Name, Chiller Name, etc. 
spreadsheets need not appear in the same order of the sequence
?you can assign the sequence numbers in any order (however, they default to 
the row number in the spreadsheet). This allows you, for example, to change 
the sequence numbers and perform multiple simulations to optimize sequencing.
You can assign more than one piece of equipment to the same sequence 
number. For example, if two units are intended to always turn on and 
operate together, assign them the same sequence number.
DOE-2 ?turns on? as many units as are required to meet the load. The load 
per unit is prorated based on that unit?s capacity relative to the total 
capacity of units operating (you can, however, assign an upper limit to 
each unit?s capacity using the Maximum Load).
DOE-2 Command: EQUIP-CTRL
DOE-2 Keyword: BOILERS-SEQ-x; CHLR/HTRS-SEQ-x; CHILLERS-SEQ-x;

    I have a question on ice storage in DOE2.1.E
    I am using TES-TYPE Brine and I defined in the begining a CTANK-BASE-T 
parameter of 46 oF - below which the energy stored cannot be retrieved.
    Not liking what I was seing - ie that a large part of the energy stored

CTANK-BASE-T parameter. However, I was shocked to see that even if I

temperature of the storage being higher.
     Is there any way around this problem one could suggest ?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] false load and MIN-RATIO entry
In-Reply-To: <s2e8b900.007@cayvr04.vancouver.keen.ca>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200507281402.AA0227390pd80000744114@gard.com>

Derek,

I'll start by expanding my last explanation to you for the benefit of the
BLDG-SIM community.  Then I'll answer your most recent question.

DOE-2.1e and DOE-2.2 chillers are similar in how they use the MIN-RATIO and
the HGB-RATIO (HBG-RATIO is the 2.2 term; 2.1e uses terms like
OPEN-REC-UNL-RAT).

The MIN-RATIO is the part load ratio (PLR) below which the chiller cycles.
For example, if the MIN-RATIO = 0.25 and the PLR is 0.20, then the chiller
runs Frac = 0.20/0.25 = 0.80 of the hour.  The PLR assumed in the EIR-FPLR
performance curve when cycling is the MIN-RATIO.  The net power consumption
when cycling is then:

OperatingCap = CAPACITY * CapfT(CHWS, ECT) 
kW = OperatingCap * ELEC-INPUT-RATIO * EIRfT(CHWS, ECT)
                                     * EIRfPLR(PLR, dT) * Frac / 3413Btu/kW

CHWS = the leaving evaporator temperature
ECT  = the entering condenser temperature
PLR  = part load ratio, = MIN-RATIO when cycling
dT   = ECT-CHWS, only for 2.2, relevant for variable-speed centrifugals
Frac = fraction of the hour the chiller is running

DOE-2.2 makes additional adjustments to the ECT to model variable-flow
water-cooled condensers.  It may also increase Frac somewhat to take into
account cycling losses (a modified feature within the last month).

Again note that, when a chiller is cycling, the program assumes that the
chiller runs at the MIN-RATIO when cycled on.  This approximates a
controller that does not allow the chiller to load rapidly when restarted
(soft starting), or a controller that cycles closely about the cut-out
temperature.


The HGB-RATIO relevant only for chillers that use hot-gas bypass to continue
running continuously at a PLR at which they otherwise would have to shut
down.  Note that most chillers DO NOT use hot gas bypass.  This term has
meaning only if the HGB-RATIO is greater than the MIN-RATIO.  For example,
assume the HGB-RATIO=0.4, and the MIN-RATIO=0.25:  

1) If the actual PLR is 0.5, then the chiller is running continuously with
no hot-gas bypass.
2) If the PLR drops to 0.3, then the chiller is running continuously, but
below the point at which hot-gas bypass initiates.  Power consumption
calculated using PLR=0.4 to model the false load due to the hot-gas bypass.

3) If the PLR drops to 0.15, then the chiller is cycling and hot-gas
bypassing simultaneously.  The fraction of the hour operating is Frac =
0.15/0.25 = 0.6.  When cycled on, the chiller runs at PLR=0.4 to model the
hot-gas bypass. 


To answer your follow-up question, when DOE-2.1e allocates load to chillers,
it first loads all chillers equally in proportion to their capacity (i.e.,
the PLR of each enabled chiller is the same).  It then checks to see if the
allocation causes any of the equipment to cycle or false load (this implies
that the MIN-RATIO and/or HGB-RATIO of different chillers are markedly
different, which is true in your case).  If it detects this condition, then
it adjusts the allocation in an attempt to run all enabled equipment without
cycling or false loading. I believe this is why you are seeing a change in
the loading of the small chiller when the only thing you have done is modify
the MIN-RATIO and hot-gas bypass ratio of the larger chiller.

Does any controller actually do this type of adjustment between chillers?  I
am not aware of any that does, although with direct-digital controls any
sequence that can be programmed is possible.  In addition to redistributing
load, the controller should ideally also redistribute flow so that the
leaving chilled-water temperature is the same for each chiller (assuming
chillers are in parallel).  In DOE-2.2 we eliminated this adjustment because
we did not think it reflected the real world.

Thanks very much for your help.  The keyword turned out to be
OPEN-REC-UNL-RAT.  Unfortunately, solving this problem created another,
which I hope you'll be able to help me with.

I am modelling two chillers: one small double bundle chiller and one larger
reciprocating chiller.  I have sequenced the operation so that the smaller
chiller is the only one to operate when the load is at or below its max
capacity.  When this capacity is exceeded, both chillers operate, with the
smaller chiller sequencing on before the larger chiller.

Now for the problem.  When I change the minimum operating ratio and hot gas
bypass ratio of the larger chiller from 25% to 17%, the PS-C report shows
the number of hours operating in each load range changes for the smaller
chiller.  I would have thought that this should be unchanged.  Any thoughts?

If MIN-RATIO is less than the HGB-RATIO (I do not recall the exact name of
this keyword), then hot-gas bypass will be simulate whenever the PLR is
between the MIN-RATIO and the HGB-RATIO.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] false load and MIN-RATIO entry

I am modelling an open reciprocating chiller in DOE2.1e.  When I specify a
MIN-RATIO lower than the default value of 0.25, the PS-C report shows a
false load on the chiller.  When I specify a value of 0.25, no false load is
reported.  This suggests to me that hot gas bypass is being modelled.

The reference manual says that, if the item of equipment operates with a
demand that is more than zero but less than the MIN-RATIO, the chiller will
cycle on and off.  Could someone please tell me what I'm missing?  Thanks.

Brian,

I encountered the same need when I was providing technical assistance on building energy standards for Egypt back in 2003. A visiting Egyptian researcher said they needed to model buildings with dones, which were prevalent in both religious (mosques) and commercial buildings. So, I wrote an awk script that generated DOE-2.1E input based on the input dome diameter and the specified number of arc segments (horizontal rows) desired.  The script generates produces a series of polygons to model the dome in any detail.  Caveats are :  (1) the dome is hemispherical, (2) the model of course does nothing about air stratification or other thermal effects, (3) one can easily be entranced by the representational accuracy of the script and transform the dome to hundreds of poygon - clearly geometrical overkill - but it looks good in drawings.

The description of the procedure is descrubed in an article I wrote  in the Sept/Oct 2002 issue of the USER NEWS, "Adapting DOE-2 to meet the needs of the Egyptian Housing and Building Research Center", p. 18-19.  You can get to the article on http://gundog.lbl.gov/dirun/23s_o_1.pdf .  It includes the awk script and a sample input.

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Modelling of a domed roof?


  I am developing a DOE-2 model in eQUEST for a building with a large domed roof.  Does anyone have any suggestions for approximating roof geometry - i.e. how many facets should I use for reasonable solar gain & conduction results?



  Any help is appreciated.



  Regards,

  Brian

Brian,

Within DOE2.2/equest you can also create triangular wall shapes that
could be used to create your dome.

Brian,

An interesting question.  I've never modeled a dome so this 
is based on intuition.

If you are thinking about comparing different dome 
insulation levels, dome shapes, etc.., then I would be 
careful and have a surface for every difference of 10 to 30 
degrees (this adds up to a lot of surfaces).  

On the other hand, if the dome will not change between 
simulation permutations, I would probably just use nine 
surfaces: eight each 45 degrees from one another around the 
dome each tilted 45 degrees and another flat one on top.  

Remember, in the model these surfaces can be square as long 
as the areas add up to the correct total area and they 
don't cast shadows on each other.

Dear colleagues,
 
The agenda for the Radiance Workshop in Montreal on August 11/12 is
taking shape
(http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/RadianceWorkshop2005/agenda050714.pd
f
<http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/RadianceWorkshop2005/agenda050714.pd

studies that used  Radiance for sustainable design. AEC, ARUP,
Enermodal, Stantec, and The Weidt Group will be presenting some of their
projects as well as the advantages and challenges of using Radiance. So,
in case your respective organizations are interested in learning more
about Radiance and its use, this might be a useful forum to attend.  
 
Christoph

Hector,

Your mesage is ironic, because back in the late 1980's, my laboratory (LBNL) held a month-long training workshop for researchers from ASEAN nations, including from the Phillipines, in the use of the ASEAM program.  But ASEAM is a very old program by now, and I'm not sure if it's still being supported (originally developed by Fleming Associates).  Do you know the format of the weather files that ASEAM uses ?  I think it's binned data, so it should be possible to generate the data from hourly sources such as the IWEC (International Weather for Energy Calculations) file for Manila.

  I come across your GARD Analytics, Inc. in the internet.  This is regarding ASEAM Energy Analysis Program.  I would like to use it here in Manila but I have a problem with its weather and Solar data it is limited to 46 major cities for the US only? Is there weather and Solar data for Manila?that is compatible to ASEAM program operation?   Is there a way I could avail them? 

  Thank you for kind attention and kindly let us know about them soon.

  Very truly your,
