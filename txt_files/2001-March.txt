Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Trane System Analyzer
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200103050832.AA325775pd80000024738@gard.com>

I'm not very familiar with Trane's System Analyzer but have a particular
question: According to Trane's website,
"System Analyzer generalizes building load characteristics. All buildings
are calculated as rectangular with two zones ? an interior and a perimeter ?
and evenly distributed internal loads, ventilation, and glass."
I'm looking at a project reference to 75 zones in a 15 story building.
That's five zones per floor which implies four perimeter and one internal
zone per floor.
Questions:
Does SA use four perimeter zones per floor? Or one?

Mark,

System Analyzer uses one perimeter zone per floor.  Therefore, there is no
diversity accounted for in the model.  The load at one point on the east
side of the perimeter zone is modeled as the same load found at any point on
the west side at the design hour or during the simulation.  While the
program generates a "rough" design load in it's wizard role, the program
documentation warns against using System Analyzer to generate heating and
cooling loads for system or building design.  

The program works very well in an energy and economic analysis role as this
"average design" can be adjusted prior to running an energy simulation.
There is overstatement of the amount of energy needed to cool or heat the
west portion of the perimeter zone in the morning hours.  This overstatement
is counterbalanced by the opposite effect in the afternoon. The program will
do a good job reporting the net energy required to maintain space conditions
during the simulation.  

DO NOT USE SYSTEM ANALYZER FOR A LOAD DESIGN TOOL. It is an excellent
comparative anlysis and energy analysis tool.  I would Also like to point
out that the user is able to model performance curves for all equipment
included in the equipment library making this a level analysis tool for
those concerned with "equipment vendor software".

Hello Yang Miao,

Attached is an hourly data file in TMY2 format for Shanghai.  This file was
generated from the WMO (World Meteorological Organization) database for
30-year (1960-1991) statistics.

The TMY2 file is in zipped format (Shanghai.zip) and is accompanied by a
second file of monthly summary data.

Best wishes.

The March/April 2001 issue of Home Energy lists the BLDG-
SIM mailing list in the article "Seeking Green Building on  
the Internet" along with 10 other electronic discussion 
groups.  It is nice to get some publicity.  

The more people on the mailing list the greater the 
collective wisdom and the more we can help each other.  At 
least that is a common theory.  For this type of mailing 
list with such a specialized topic, one of the best ways to 
increase its membership is for the participants to spread 
the word.  If you feel that subscribing to this mailing 
list would help someone else in the building energy 
simulation field who might not be aware of the mailing 
list, please point them to our web site at:

Colleagues,

My apologies to the Ladies I offended yesterday by addressing my question to
"Gentlemen".  I had sent this earlier to 4 men, who I believe are all
Gentlemen, and I neglected to remove that salutation when I forwarded it to
this larger audience. The error was unintentional.

Gentlemen,

Someone is trying to show the average annual savings that can be realized by
a
homeowner installing a whole-house fan and using it in the months before and
after the hot portion of summer, and also in the evening and overnight
during the peak summer months.

I seem to remember such a study being done some time ago, but don't remember
who did it or when.

This is a pretty basic, practical question.  Can you help me out on this?
