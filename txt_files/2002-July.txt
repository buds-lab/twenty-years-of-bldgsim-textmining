I don't know if this hit this list or not so -- FYI.
Hopefully this will replace the ECB methodolgy for metrics (such as LEED)
application.
I urge everyone involved in modeling for benchmarking/metric use to look at
and comment.

In case you might not have heard the proposed ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Annex G
that facilitates benchmarking a design against the standard, which we
discussed in Honolulu, is now available from the ASHRAE website for download

As you are aware, the program does not fully address steam loops. Steam loops consist of a myriad of components, many of which experience large thermal losses, and are prone to failure (such as steam traps)

One way to approximate a steam loop is to model it as a single hot-water loop, but specifying a steam boiler.  The steam boiler default efficiency is reduced to take into account some of the losses associated with the de-aerator and other parasitic devices; however the parasitic losses were not well-researched, and the default efficiency is simply an semi-educated guess. (I came up with the value after thinking about it for a total of 5 minutes).

Steam loops tend to have HUGE annual losses; I believe that in most cases they exceed the actual annual end-use load. Throw in a couple of malfunctioning steam traps and they can be ridiculous. In spite of the fact that DOE-2.2/PowerDOE/eQUEST can model piping losses, most people neglect them, thinking they are small.  They are NOT small in most cases.

You should definitely specify the piping UA so the program can calculate losses. To better account for the UA split between the hot-water and steam loops, you could model a primary/secondary loop arrangement, where the primary loop is the "steam" loop, and the secondary loop is the hot-water loop.  To make the pumping energy of the "steam" loop match the actual pumping energy (condensate, de-aeration, and pressurization), you can adjust the head loss of the piping, boiler, and valve modulating flow into the secondary loop.

Hot-water loops can also have very large losses; I have found that the losses in VAV/hot-water reheat systems typically exceed the annual reheat load.

Dear all,

Can anyone advise on the capability (or not) of esp-r to model the effects
of internal blinds in highly glazed spaces?  My interest is in predicting
comfort conditions in conservatories where the large glazed area affects
occupant comfort in terms of radiant asymmetry.  Can blinds be modelled
explicitly to determine their surface temperature and their effect on
internal & interzonal radiation distribution, or is specifying an overall
solar transmission coefficient for the glass/blind combination the only
option?

DESIGN ANALYSIS INTEGRATION (DAI) INITIATIVE

Location: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Washington Office,
Washington DC, USA
Date and times: September 6th, 2002, 10:30 AM - 3:30 PM
Attendance at no cost, but registration is requested.

During the past year a group of researchers from Georgia Institute of
Technology, Carnegie-Mellon University and University of Pennsylvania has
been working on a DOE-funded project aimed at a new generation of
interfaces between building design and analysis. A first prototype has been
developed concentrating on energy analysis using EnergyPlus. The key
feature of the interface is that it is  process centric, driven by user
defined analysis scenarios. The resulting interfaces will eventually be
able to deal with structured and unstructured information, allow
"constructive" user interaction during the mapping process, and incorporate
existing models such as the IFC for the 'automatic' parts of the interface.

At the workshop the research team intends to present the results to an
audience of design analysis tool developers, tool users (consultants) and
people working on building product models  (e.g. from the IAI-IFC, STEP and
BLIS communities). The workshop will be used to gather feedback on the
first prototype, establish ties with potential collaborators and define
follow-up efforts. Participants will receive a copy of the final report of
the concluded first phase of the research.

If you are interested in attending this workshop please send an email to
pieterdewilde at arch.gatech.edu or fried.augenbroe at arch.gatech.edu. You will
then receive the final workshop program and directions to the venue.

Preliminary program:
10:30 - 11:00:  Introduction of the DAI-Initiative
11:00 - 11:45:  Presentation and demonstration of the DAI-Interface
11:45 - 12:30:   Enabling technologies: conceptual modeling, XML,
interfaces to simulation engines
12:30 -  1:30:   lunch (will be provided)
 1:30 -  2:30:   Future developments (workshop style)
 2:30 -  3:30:   Joint efforts and Discussion

In the coming weeks further details of the workshop will be posted on the
DAI web site: http://dcom.arch.gatech.edu/dai/

Progress on User Interfaces for EnergyPlus.

The most asked questions about EnergyPlus are 'Where is the interface?'
and 'When will commercial interfaces be available?'.

Several tools are now available to ease the pain of using
EnergyPlus--although
neither is a full user-friendly interface--see information from The
Deringer Group:
http://www.deringergroup.com/Software/EPlusTools.htm   They also use
EnergyPlus in on-line simulations.

We are pleased to announce that we expect the first EnergyPlus user
interface to be
available later this summer.  Two interface developers have posted
information
on their web sites:

   Taylor Systems Engineering ( http://www.tse-inc.net/epi.htm ) plans to
   have a
residential building interface in Summer 2002 and a nonresidential
interface late
Summer 2002.

   Energy Coding  ( http://www.designbuilder.co.uk ) is developing a full
   featured
building design tool called DesignBuilder that will include energy modeling
using
EnergyPlus.  They tell us that a fully functional beta version may be
available in
September--but a very preliminary test version of DesignBuilder is
available now
for download.

Five other organizations tell us that they plan to develop user interfaces
over the
next year or so--but no specific dates are yet available.  We will announce
the availability of user interfaces and tools as they become available on
the
EnergyPlus web site.

Hello,

I would very much appreciate your thoughts on a few questions I have
relating to building simulation programs. Specifically:

1. Are there any commercial EnergyPlus interfaces now available? The
EnergyPlus website suggests that several are being developed for release as
early as mid-2002 (i.e., now), but I have been unable to find any
information about them.
2. Are there any building simulation programs/add-ons that incorporate
daylighting analysis? Alternately, is there any compatability between
programs like EnergyPlus/TRNSYS and Radiance?
3. For whole-building (energy) analysis of window systems, are TRNSYS and
EnergyPlus best used separately or in combination? I?d be interested in
your experience with these programs, particularly as they relate to
modeling applications focused on window systems.

Thanks for your help.

Sincerely / Med venlig hilsen / Mit freundlichen Gr??en,

Call For Papers
"How Low Can You Go? Case Studies Of Very Low Energy Buildings"

A symposium for ASHRAE's 2003 Annual meeting June 2003, Kansas City,
Missouri

Recent interest in very low energy commercial buildings begs the question
"How Low Can You Go?". Just how little energy can a commercial office
building use and still satisfy the indoor environmental needs of the
building's occupants?

ASHRAE TC9.6 - Systems' Energy Utilization and TC1.10 - Energy Resources are
looking for well-documented examples of ultra-low energy large commercial
buildings. The building's energy use and thermal comfort must be documented
in accordance with applicable ASHRAE standards (105, 55, 62, etc.) and have
at least one years worth of documented performance. The symposium's intent
is to show just how energy efficient a building can be and to demonstrate to
the industry how to get there and what are the costs and benefit of doing
so.

Abstracts are due Aug. 1, 2002. Selected review papers are due Sept 27, 2002
and final versions of papers will be due Feb 1, 2003. The symposium is
planned for June 22-26, 2003 Send abstracts to:

I remember TRNSYS users reading in RADIANCE data via the
generic Data Reader type in TRNSYS (type 9), although I don't
remember the name of the user.

I'm sure if you ask the question on the TRNSYS users's mailing list
you'll get a bunch of suggestions ...

For a number of years ESP-r has supported several approaches to
simultaneous thermal and lighting simulation via Radiance. Esp-r 
includes a module which exports the current thermal model into 
a highly structured Radiance model with full attribution and 
then coerces Radiance modules to accomplish a number of 
lighting/visualisation tasks (external and internal views, 
daylight factors, glare assessments, etc.). 

The module is designed to protect practitioners from the "black hole of 
parameter tweaking" which typifies raw use of Radiance. Expert uses can 
use the module to tweak the parameters and the model description if they 
wish. 

In "simultaneous thermal/lighting assessments" the user can use Radiance 
derived fixed daylight factors within lighting control circuits or the 
simulation engine can call Radiance at each time step to enquire about 
the lux at various points for purposes of control. There is also an 
option pre-calculates daylight coefficients for each external glazing 
which can be useful for high-frequency long-period assessments. 

Additional information is available at <http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk>.

Hi,

 We are trying to simulate in either eQuest or PowerDoe the use of window or
through-wall unitary air-conditioners in an otherwise uncooled building. Is
this possible? Or alternatively, can zones in eQuest be specified as having
cooling even if the building as a whole does not? Or any other suggestions
on how to model these system?

thanks
