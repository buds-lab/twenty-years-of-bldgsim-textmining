All,

If you have used this alternative compliance path successfully (see attached), would you mind reaching out for a quick chat about it?

We are interested in using this alternative compliance path to show greater savings with our energy model. However, we want to understand any potential issues that might arise if we implement it.

I am curious if others have used Kawneer's interpolation tables for assembly u-value on LEED submissions and had a good result.

I have in the past been somewhat puzzled what to put in the below entry field of Table 1.4 if I am relying on Kawneer's tables.

I imagine you could put "other" and say "manufacturer tables calculated per NFRC 100."

Is this acceptable / have others have had any issues?
Cross posting to bldg-sim as this has broader applicability than just Trace.

In one case, I was able to get the NFRC calculation from the window manufacturer.  This was on a design/build job where the windows had already been approved and purchased.  I would add that it wasn't easy, the manufacturer would not help me until I got our GC involved.

On another job that I'm currently working on, the architect provided a cut sheet for both the glass and the aluminum curtain wall system they are specifying.  The curtain wall manufacturer's cut sheet had tables that listed the assembly u-values and SHGC's for different center of glass values (see attachment).  I have not submtted this job yet but I hope the LEED reviewers will accept this approach.  The manufacturer states the calculations are NFRC compliant.

Build the window assembles in windows from LBNL and then put those assemblies into your Trace libraries.  Put them into your model and explain to the reviewer how you did it.

Hi,

Working on a LEED energy model in Trace. I typically use HAP, which allows the input of a window frame type, and it then calculates the entire window assembly U-value and SC, rather than just the glass.

I've had LEED reviewers come back and ask me for my window assembly calcs and I was able to show how HAP was doing that calc based on the frame type as well. However, I can't find anything similar in Trace, and I'm getting nervous about how to show assembly calculations to a LEED reviewer. I've had terrible luck in the past getting assembly values from the manufacturer as well.

I spoke with CDS and they recommended modeling a small sliver of wall that is representative of the frame, which seems quite tedious.

Has anyone either experienced this issue, and figured out a work around?

Thanks!

Ben Hollon,

*Descriptions*


Title: Spatial analysis of thermal and daylight building simulation data
with Mr.Comfy


Mr.Comfy is a plugin for Rhinoceros3d's parametric modeling environment
Grasshopper, written in Python, that allows designers to interactively
visualize EnergyPlus thermal and Daysim climate-based daylight building
simulation results data in design or daylight simulation models.

Instead of using charts or tabular formats, energy consumption, comfort,
illuminance levels and any other available performance report variable are
directly displayed through color-coded surfaces (and numeric values) where
they occur - in the individual thermal zones of a design. Mr.Comfy thus
bridges the gap between sustainable designers' need to analyze data
spatially but still retain numeric precision and multiple data
representation modes as typically exposed through traditional graphing.

The presentation introduces Mr.Comfy's key featues, relates them to
sustainable architectural design cognition and presents several case
studies of past student work.

Mr.Comfy is available free of charge at http://MrComfy.org<http://mrcomfy.org/>

About the Speaker: Max is the developer of Mr.Comfy, a spatial thermal
simulation data mapping tool, and founder in progress at
designefficiency.net, which will introduce design-driven building
simulation to architects. He previously served at the TU as assistant
professor in an EU-funded digital media literacy research project that
investigated the effects of simulation and rapid prototyping technologies
on architectural design. Max graduated from the TU Berlin in 2011 with a
diploma in Architecture; prior to joining its academic staff, he
volunteered as an urban and architectural designer for the Humane Society
of the United States and India's Keystone Foundation.

Dear All,

We still have a few places remaining on the DesignBuilder EnergyPlus simulation training course in Brussels in May 2014. This face to face course will be delivered in English and is an excellent opportunity to find out how to get the most out of DesignBuilder and learn best practice modelling techniques. It is suitable for new and experienced users alike, and is structured to give you plenty of worked examples so you can 'learn by doing'. The last 2 days will be of particular interest for those needing to get up to speed with EnergyPlus HVAC system simulations.
The course is completely modular and you can choose to attend any of the 6 days according to your particular training requirements. Choose from 6 days:

*        Day 1: 6th May - Modeller.  To gain the knowledge required to confidently set up building geometry using blocks, zone up and define and select constructions and glazing.

*        Day 2: 7th May - Basic Simulation*. Learn how to use component blocks, templates for improved modelling efficiency, heating and cooling design, basic simulation, solar shading, lighting, and HVAC data entry.

*        Day 3: 8th May - Natural Ventilation, Daylighting & Renewables*. Modelling low environmental impact design solutions including natural ventilation, daylighting and renewables.

*        Day 4: 9th May - CFD*. Learn the key concepts of internal and external CFD from the basic building blocks through to using simulation data to define boundary conditions more accurately.

*        Day 5: 12th May - Introduction to Detailed HVAC*. Introducing the power of EnergyPlus HVAC modelling in DesignBuilder and getting started with detailed HVAC including HVAC templates and the basic loop types.

*        Day 6: 13th May - Detailed HVAC*. Focus on Detailed HVAC for more complex modelling tasks, with examples on heated floors and a VAV system building up to simulating a system with full humidity control.
*Note that Days 2-6 all require previous experience with the modeller or attendance of Day 1.
The cost of the course is 350 Euro (300 GBP) per day. Discounts are available for booking 4 or more days or if more than one person from your organisation is attending. You can find out more about the Brussels Simulation training course from:
http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/content/view/134/203/
I hope to see you there!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Training: Discover New Features in OpenStudio v1.3.0
Message-ID: <CF69C6B2.BBF5%mloder@psdconsulting.com>

Join PSD on May 6th, 2014 from 1:00-2:00pm EDT for a free LIVE demonstration of the most exciting new features in OpenStudio v1.3.0.  As a licensed OpenStudio training and support organization, PSD is offering this webinar to raise awareness of the potential power of OpenStudio. The webinar will be led by PSD?s Vice President of Research and Development, Chris Balbach.  Sign up for the free webinar here: https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/375878706

Features that will be covered:

Support for modeling refrigeration systems:

OpenStudio 1.3.0 introduces drag, drop and configuration capabilities to model the energy use of common commercial refrigeration systems (e.g. display cases and walk in coolers), including cascading systems. While this is not unique, the ability to integrate the energy impacts of refrigeration systems into a building?s heat balance at an adjustable sub-hourly time step provides tightly coupled feedback for estimating the interactions between energy systems.

Support for modeling VRF HVAC systems

OpenStudio provides drag, drop and configure capabilities for modeling VRF (Variable Flow Refrigerant) HVAC systems and controls of varying complexity. VRF systems can be configured to operate in either a ?heat pump? mode, (where the system operates in either heating or cooling mode) or in a heat recovery mode (where indoor units can recover and exchange heat with other indoor units operating in the opposite mode). In addition, the outdoor units can be configured to be air, water or evaporative cooled. User defined performance curves (generated from manufacturers published performance data) can now be used to describe equipment performance.

Support for modeling supply and return plenum configurations

Forced Air HVAC systems commonly use plenums for supplying and/or returning the conditioned air. This release of OpenStudio allows users to define and configure supply and return plenums that serve multiple conditioned zones. Plenums are considered unconditioned thermal zones and are composed of children OpenStudio spaces.  The plenum zones can leverage OpenStudio?s space type definitions for rapid object and property assignments.

Best,

Marek Loder
Manager, Strategy and Marketing

Message-ID: <AF7766FF9623CB419803ECF0D4FF04F20729D869@UUSNWE1N.na.utcmail.com>

I was told by an EnergyPro user that when the software auto-generates input files for App G baselines, there is no way to inform it that a zone is "exceptional" and should be given its own System 3 or 4. It apparently does not attempt to do this on its own, either. Can anyone tell me if this is really true?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <939DCF2311FEDB4982E93C955B9216251144C258@AMXExMb01.global.arup.com>

All,

I am trying to determine the impact of switching an already built energy model which follows ASHRAE 90.1 2007 (LEED 2009) to ASHRAE 90.1 2010 (LEED V4).

I know that at face value, this will likely negatively impact the percent energy cost savings that I have been able to show. The LEED V4 point-system is different, so it might not impact the savings quite so adversely.

Any advice or quick thoughts?

Much appreciated,

Is this LEED-CI, or NC/CS/etc?  Modeling for LEED-CI under v4 is an
entirely different animal.  NC/CS not as much so.

 

90.1-2010 requires auto-receptacle control, daylight harvesting for
zones with > 250 SF of window area, etc.  Lots of control changes like
that, but nothing that would make you redo the basic structure of an
NC/CS model.

Qinpeng,
I found a recent article stating that Beijing was only recently requiring municipalities to report GHG emissions.
http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/china-carbon-idUSL3N0MF29820140318

It will probably be a couple of years before official government figures are available.  That said, you may be able to find information on criteria pollutants as they usually have more established reporting processes.  You might have to check with some environmental watchdogs or Chinese universities to find much on carbon emissions I'm thinking.  Best of luck,

Hi Qinpeng,

It will be difficult to get something equivalent to the document that you are referring to for China.
However, for CO2 conversion factor across the whole China you may want to have a look at the spreadsheet that comes together with this IEA publication:

"IEA (2012). CO2 emissions from fuel combustion highlights. International Energy Agency (IEA) Statistics, 2012 edition."

Best regards,
Georgios

Hello Bldg-simers,

I am modeling a discharge air temperature reset strategy in TRACE based on worst case zone, resetting a maximum of 5 degrees.  The particular ECM is for a facility served by a central plant (steam and chilled water).  I am currently seeing electricity and steam savings, however I am also seeing a chilled water penalty.  Has anyone experienced this before or have an explanation as to why this might be?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <02c301cf5588$9449a000$bcdce000$@naturalintelligence.us>

The training will be run using the new version 4 of DesignBuilder and will cover many of the new and enhanced features such as the new geometric modeler with enhanced block geometry editing, the ability to mirror blocks, add individual surfaces, and produce cut-away/section visualizations.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike and is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days.

The course is organized so that architects could attend only the first 2-3 days and the last 2 days are specific to engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Dates: Monday - Friday, June 2 - 6, 2014

Venue: American Institute of Architects, 1735 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20006-5292 <http://www.aia.org/about/directions/index.htm> 

Cost: $299 per day. Discounts are available for booking 4 or more days or if more than one person from your organization will attend.

Space is limited so we encourage early registration.

Additional course information and registration. <http://designbuilderusa.com/training/designbuilder-simulation-training-days> 

Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use, most powerful graphical user interface to EnergyPlus available and includes ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Baseline HVAC System templates, materials, and construction libraries.

Questions regarding the training may be sent to trainer at designbuilderusa.com or you may telephone 415-531-4610.

	Energyplus
Message-ID: <1397760491.11227.YahooMailNeo@web141201.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Eppy
Eppy is a scripting language for EnergyPlus idf files, and EnergyPlus output files. Eppy is written in the programming language Python. As a result it takes full advantage of the rich data structure and idioms that are avaliable in python. You can programmatically navigate, search, and modify EnergyPlus idf files using eppy. The power of using a scripting language allows you to do the following:
	* Make a large number of changes in an idf file with a few lines of eppy code.
	* Use conditions and filters when making changes to an idf file
	* Make changes to multiple idf files.
	* Read data from the output files of a EnergyPlus simulation run.
	* Based on the results of a EnergyPlus simulation run, generate the input file for the next simulation run.
So what does this matter? Here are some of the things you can do with eppy:
	* Change construction for all north facing walls.
	* Change the glass type for all windows larger than 2 square meters.
	* Change the number of people in all the interior zones.
	* Change the lighting power in all south facing zones.
	* Change the efficiency and fan power of all rooftop units.
	* Find the energy use of all the models in a folder (or of models that were run after a certain date)
You can install from :?https://pypi.python.org/pypi/eppy/0.4.6
The documentation is at:?http://pythonhosted.org//eppy/
to get a quick sense of how it feels to use eppy, take a look at?http://pythonhosted.org//eppy/Main_Tutorial.html
email?me if you run into any issues.
Put "eppy" in the subject line (the spam filter tends to be rather aggressive, and I might have to look in the junk folder)

The code is hosted on github <https://github.com/santoshphilip/eppy>, in case you want to grab the latest code. It is under active development


--------------------------

Some background to the project

Eppy was developed over the last year, for the ASHRAE 1651-RP research project that required modifying large number of files and analyzing the results.
Eppy was partially funded by ASHRAE
The original code was written in 2004 as a text interface for Energyplus and the scripting language was built on it's foundations
The open source license is GPLv3

The code has been heavily used and is very robust and stable
It works for all versions of Energyplus. It is designed to to work without modifications on future versions too.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Updated Radiance Installers Available
Message-ID: <CF75FF65.6CED%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Greetings, ray wranglers.

We are pleased to announce the availability of fresh Radiance installers for Windows, OSX, and Linux, on the NREL Radiance Git mirror (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance<https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.a.4>).  This new batch of installers is based on our tag 4.2.a.4 (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.a.4 ) which was created today, and includes all updates to HEAD as of this morning. These tags are *unofficial* snapshots of the *official* LBNL Radiance source tree (HEAD), located at: http://radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/?pathrev=MAIN.

A couple of things worth noting for this release:
* The Windows installer now optionally adds the Radiance "bin" directory to the user or system %PATH%, and creates a %RAYPATH% environment variable and sets it to  the Radiance "lib" directory.
* A couple of nifty new utilities written by Axel Jacobs are included, ltview.pl and ltpict.pl. They work similarly to objview and objpict, but are intended for visualizing luminaires (there's a manpage for each =)). ltview.pl supersedes the "-l" option to objview.rb that was added last year, and therefore objview.rb has been removed from the Radiance source.
* As always, see the release notes for more info: https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/blob/4.2.a.4/doc/notes/ReleaseNotes

Follow the photons, people.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Reducing Fan Power for ERVs
Message-ID: <AF7766FF9623CB419803ECF0D4FF04F20729EA61@UUSNWE1N.na.utcmail.com>

I'm trying to reduce the annual energy use of some DOAS/ERV fans which will run at constant volume 24/7 365 days per year.

Right now we have 3.5" TSP on the supply/OA and 2.25" TSP on the exhaust. I'm looking at some of the obvious measures to reduce the design static.

Right now the fan efficiencies in this unit are in the mid to low 50%s. The fans are part of the ERV and are just described as "forward curved;" I didn't think a squirrel cage fan could handle that static but whatever they have is rated for it.

So, would any of the designers on this list have specific suggestions for ERVs with fans that would be more efficient at these conditions?

Thanks,
Fred

We have moved away from selecting ERVs with fans because we can't find any
that we're satisfied with.  We generally spec the BPE heat exchangers
because the pressure drop is extremely low for the high heat recovery
performance.  For fans we usually use the Greenheck SQ-VG series (or the
loren cook equivalent) with ECM motors or the TMI/ZA series.  Both of them
are very efficient, but the TMI/ZA fans are a bit better.   I think you'll
probably want to go with the TMI/ZA fans with that much static.

	soon
Message-ID: <01ee01cf5e27$663d69b0$32b83d10$@naturalintelligence.us>

Space is limited so you do not want to wait until the last minute to register for this course.

The training will be run using the new version 4 of DesignBuilder and will cover many of the new and enhanced features such as the new geometric modeller with enhanced block geometry editing, the ability to mirror blocks, add individual surfaces, and produce cut-away/section visualizations.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days.

The course is organized so that architects could attend only the first 2-3 days and the last 2 days are specific to engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Dates: Monday - Friday, June 2 - 6, 2014

Venue: American Institute of Architects, 1735 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20006-5292 <http://www.aia.org/about/directions/index.htm> 

Cost: $299 per day. Discounts are available for booking 4 or more days or if more than one person from your organization will attend. Please contact us for details of how to obtain a discount for multiple bookings or for any other information about the course.

Additional course information and registration <http://designbuilderusa.com/training/designbuilder-simulation-training-days> .

Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use, most powerful graphical user interface to EnergyPlus available and includes ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Baseline HVAC System templates, materials, and construction libraries.

Questions regarding the training may be sent to trainer at designbuilderusa.com or you may telephone 415-531-4610.

Message-ID: <5357F8D0.50202@gard.com>

For the past several years there have been two annual releases of DOE?s 
energy simulation engine EnergyPlus, in April and October. In 2014, we 
are skipping the April release. EnergyPlus has recently been translated 
from FORTRAN to C++ (see announcement at 
http://energy.gov/eere/articles/energyplus-boosts-building-efficiency-help-autodesk), 
and additional time was needed to complete the transition which included 
not only the program itself but also its development environment and 
processes. The transition is expected to be fully complete in the 
summer. The next EnergyPlus release will be in the fall of 2014, and we 
hope to announce a firm date?as well as new features?in the next month 
or two.

Dear Michael Witte,

In the new EnergyPlus version, will there be significant changes in the IDF
Editor such as the general class structure, the way the objects are created
under each class etc.? In other words, would the interfaces written based
on the objects of IDF Editor have to go through drastic changes or do overs
in order to work with the new EnergyPlus version? I would appreciate it
very much if you could give us a little information about these points.

Thanks in advance,
Best Regards,
Simge Andolsun, PhD.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LIVE Demo - New Features in OpenStudio v1.3.0
Message-ID: <CF8425FF.5777C%dtan@psdconsulting.com>

[http://psdconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/openstudio-training.jpg]

Join PSD next week on May 6th, 2014 from 1:00-2:00pm EDT for a free LIVE demonstration of the most exciting new features in OpenStudio v1.3.0.  As a licensed OpenStudio training and support organization, PSD is offering this webinar to raise awareness of the potential power of OpenStudio. The webinar will be led by PSD?s Vice President of Research and Development, Chris Balbach.

Sign up for the free webinar here: https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/375878706

Features that will be covered:

1) Support for modeling refrigeration systems:

OpenStudio 1.3.0 introduces drag, drop and configuration capabilities to model the energy use of common commercial refrigeration systems (e.g. display cases and walk in coolers), including cascading systems. While this is not unique, the ability to integrate the energy impacts of refrigeration systems into a building?s heat balance at an adjustable sub-hourly time step provides tightly coupled feedback for estimating the interactions between energy systems.

2) Support for modeling VRF HVAC systems

OpenStudio provides drag, drop and configure capabilities for modeling VRF (Variable Flow Refrigerant) HVAC systems and controls of varying complexity. VRF systems can be configured to operate in either a ?heat pump? mode, (where the system operates in either heating or cooling mode) or in a heat recovery mode (where indoor units can recover and exchange heat with other indoor units operating in the opposite mode). In addition, the outdoor units can be configured to be air, water or evaporative cooled. User defined performance curves (generated from manufacturers published performance data) can now be used to describe equipment performance.

3) Support for modeling supply and return plenum configurations

Forced Air HVAC systems commonly use plenums for supplying and/or returning the conditioned air. This release of OpenStudio allows users to define and configure supply and return plenums that serve multiple conditioned zones. Plenums are considered unconditioned thermal zones and are composed of children OpenStudio spaces.  The plenum zones can leverage OpenStudio?s space type definitions for rapid object and property assignments.

4) Support for incorporating ASHRAE Advanced Energy Design Guides (AEDG) 50% measures

Thirty seven new OpenStudio measures from the ASHRAE K-2 and Small to Medium Office 50% AEDG have been added to the NREL BCL public measures library. These measures represent performance descriptions matching the published documents.  As such, these measures contain the logic needed to easily & consistently transform OpenStudio models to evaluate potential savings from incorporating high performance building and system components.  Easy application (drag and drop) of these measure to YOUR models will be demonstrated.

Visit http://openstudiotraining.com/ to learn more about OpenStudio.

Best,
David

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Updated Standard 90.1 Prototype Building Models Available
Message-ID: <2E68197026D1FA4CB47E994E31D4A50A0B14614B@EX10MBOX06.pnnl.gov>

Funded through DOE's Building Energy Codes Program, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) developed a suite of prototype building models to support the development of ASHRAE Standard 90.1. These prototype buildings-derived from DOE's Commercial Reference Building Models-cover 80% of the commercial building floor area in the United States for new construction, including both commercial buildings and mid- to high-rise residential buildings, across all U.S. climate zones.

 As Standard 90.1 evolves and EnergyPlus is updated, PNNL makes modifications to the commercial prototype building models, with extensive input from ASHRAE 90.1 Standing Standards Project Committee members and other building industry experts. Updated models have recently been posted including the following major updates:

1. Standard 90.1-2013 models

2. EnergyPlus Version 8.0

3. TMY3 weather data.

 The prototype models include 16 commercial building types in 17 climate locations for the four most recent editions of Standard 90.1 (2004, 2007, 2010, and 2013). The current combination results in an overall set of 1,088 total building models. The building models and accompanying documentation can be downloaded at https://www.energycodes.gov/development/commercial/90.1_models

I am simulating an existing building in Revit 2014, can anybody guide me
what thermal properties i should use for building envelope? Should i use
typical values or should i have to measure physically? Walls are made up of
concrete blocks with plaster on both sides and slab is RCC.

>  *2) Support for modeling VRF HVAC systems  *
>
>  OpenStudio provides drag, drop and configure capabilities for modeling
> VRF (Variable Flow Refrigerant) HVAC systems and controls of varying
> complexity. VRF systems can be configured to operate in either a ?heat
> pump? mode, (where the system operates in either heating or cooling mode)
> or in a heat recovery mode (where indoor units can recover and exchange
> heat with other indoor units operating in the opposite mode). In addition,
> the outdoor units can be configured to be air, water or evaporative cooled.
> User defined performance curves (generated from manufacturers published
> performance data) can now be used to describe equipment performance.
>
>  *3) Support for modeling supply and return plenum configurations  *
>
>  Forced Air HVAC systems commonly use plenums for supplying and/or
> returning the conditioned air. This release of OpenStudio allows users to
> define and configure supply and return plenums that serve multiple
> conditioned zones. Plenums are considered unconditioned thermal zones and
> are composed of children OpenStudio spaces.  The plenum zones can leverage
> OpenStudio?s space type definitions for rapid object and property
> assignments.
>
>  *4) Support for incorporating ASHRAE Advanced Energy Design Guides
> (AEDG) 50% measures*
>
>  Thirty seven new OpenStudio measures from the ASHRAE K-2 and Small to
> Medium Office 50% AEDG have been added to the NREL BCL public measures
> library. These measures represent performance descriptions matching the
> published documents.  As such, these measures contain the logic needed to *easily

Message-ID: <CALgQ-nJmWc7eh3t2rr5vXtDm2g6te8eK=SvrRhow3qEwf03jxg@mail.gmail.com>

I need to get data concerning the average energy consumption of museums and

inefficient. In fact, my goal is to predict, very approximately, the energy
consumption of a building that is going to be designed in the next months.
Getting a range of possible values would be great. The data should be
divided in heating, cooling, ventilation, hot water, lighting, process
energy. In http://buildingsdatabook.eren.doe.gov/ I have found interesting
data, but not specifically relative to museums and conference rooms. Where
could I find a database or a study that could help me, please?

Hi Francesco,

Check out Energy Star's Target Finder tool (http://1.usa.gov/1meKa2p). It 
appears to have museums as a primary function and it also has convention 
center which may be the closest thing to conference room other than office 
type.

I hope that helps.

All,

If you have used this alternative compliance path successfully (see attached), would you mind reaching out for a quick chat about it?

We are interested in using this alternative compliance path to show greater savings with our energy model. However, we want to understand any potential issues that might arise if we implement it.

I am curious if others have used Kawneer's interpolation tables for assembly u-value on LEED submissions and had a good result.

I have in the past been somewhat puzzled what to put in the below entry field of Table 1.4 if I am relying on Kawneer's tables.

I imagine you could put "other" and say "manufacturer tables calculated per NFRC 100."

Is this acceptable / have others have had any issues?
Cross posting to bldg-sim as this has broader applicability than just Trace.

Subject: Re: [Trace-users] Specify Window Frame Type

In one case, I was able to get the NFRC calculation from the window manufacturer.  This was on a design/build job where the windows had already been approved and purchased.  I would add that it wasn't easy, the manufacturer would not help me until I got our GC involved.

On another job that I'm currently working on, the architect provided a cut sheet for both the glass and the aluminum curtain wall system they are specifying.  The curtain wall manufacturer's cut sheet had tables that listed the assembly u-values and SHGC's for different center of glass values (see attachment).  I have not submtted this job yet but I hope the LEED reviewers will accept this approach.  The manufacturer states the calculations are NFRC compliant.

Subject: Re: [Trace-users] Specify Window Frame Type

Build the window assembles in windows from LBNL and then put those assemblies into your Trace libraries.  Put them into your model and explain to the reviewer how you did it.

Hi,

Working on a LEED energy model in Trace. I typically use HAP, which allows the input of a window frame type, and it then calculates the entire window assembly U-value and SC, rather than just the glass.

I've had LEED reviewers come back and ask me for my window assembly calcs and I was able to show how HAP was doing that calc based on the frame type as well. However, I can't find anything similar in Trace, and I'm getting nervous about how to show assembly calculations to a LEED reviewer. I've had terrible luck in the past getting assembly values from the manufacturer as well.

I spoke with CDS and they recommended modeling a small sliver of wall that is representative of the frame, which seems quite tedious.

Has anyone either experienced this issue, and figured out a work around?

Thanks!

Ben Hollon,

*Descriptions*


Title: Spatial analysis of thermal and daylight building simulation data
with Mr.Comfy


Mr.Comfy is a plugin for Rhinoceros3d's parametric modeling environment
Grasshopper, written in Python, that allows designers to interactively
visualize EnergyPlus thermal and Daysim climate-based daylight building
simulation results data in design or daylight simulation models.

Instead of using charts or tabular formats, energy consumption, comfort,
illuminance levels and any other available performance report variable are
directly displayed through color-coded surfaces (and numeric values) where
they occur - in the individual thermal zones of a design. Mr.Comfy thus
bridges the gap between sustainable designers' need to analyze data
spatially but still retain numeric precision and multiple data
representation modes as typically exposed through traditional graphing.

The presentation introduces Mr.Comfy's key featues, relates them to
sustainable architectural design cognition and presents several case
studies of past student work.

Mr.Comfy is available free of charge at http://MrComfy.org<http://mrcomfy.org/>

About the Speaker: Max is the developer of Mr.Comfy, a spatial thermal
simulation data mapping tool, and founder in progress at
designefficiency.net, which will introduce design-driven building
simulation to architects. He previously served at the TU as assistant
professor in an EU-funded digital media literacy research project that
investigated the effects of simulation and rapid prototyping technologies
on architectural design. Max graduated from the TU Berlin in 2011 with a
diploma in Architecture; prior to joining its academic staff, he
volunteered as an urban and architectural designer for the Humane Society
of the United States and India's Keystone Foundation.

Dear All,

We still have a few places remaining on the DesignBuilder EnergyPlus simulation training course in Brussels in May 2014. This face to face course will be delivered in English and is an excellent opportunity to find out how to get the most out of DesignBuilder and learn best practice modelling techniques. It is suitable for new and experienced users alike, and is structured to give you plenty of worked examples so you can 'learn by doing'. The last 2 days will be of particular interest for those needing to get up to speed with EnergyPlus HVAC system simulations.
The course is completely modular and you can choose to attend any of the 6 days according to your particular training requirements. Choose from 6 days:

*        Day 1: 6th May - Modeller.  To gain the knowledge required to confidently set up building geometry using blocks, zone up and define and select constructions and glazing.

*        Day 2: 7th May - Basic Simulation*. Learn how to use component blocks, templates for improved modelling efficiency, heating and cooling design, basic simulation, solar shading, lighting, and HVAC data entry.

*        Day 3: 8th May - Natural Ventilation, Daylighting & Renewables*. Modelling low environmental impact design solutions including natural ventilation, daylighting and renewables.

*        Day 4: 9th May - CFD*. Learn the key concepts of internal and external CFD from the basic building blocks through to using simulation data to define boundary conditions more accurately.

*        Day 5: 12th May - Introduction to Detailed HVAC*. Introducing the power of EnergyPlus HVAC modelling in DesignBuilder and getting started with detailed HVAC including HVAC templates and the basic loop types.

*        Day 6: 13th May - Detailed HVAC*. Focus on Detailed HVAC for more complex modelling tasks, with examples on heated floors and a VAV system building up to simulating a system with full humidity control.
*Note that Days 2-6 all require previous experience with the modeller or attendance of Day 1.
The cost of the course is 350 Euro (300 GBP) per day. Discounts are available for booking 4 or more days or if more than one person from your organisation is attending. You can find out more about the Brussels Simulation training course from:

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Training: Discover New Features in OpenStudio v1.3.0
Message-ID: <CF69C6B2.BBF5%mloder@psdconsulting.com>

Join PSD on May 6th, 2014 from 1:00-2:00pm EDT for a free LIVE demonstration of the most exciting new features in OpenStudio v1.3.0.  As a licensed OpenStudio training and support organization, PSD is offering this webinar to raise awareness of the potential power of OpenStudio. The webinar will be led by PSD?s Vice President of Research and Development, Chris Balbach.  Sign up for the free webinar here: https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/375878706

Features that will be covered:

Support for modeling refrigeration systems:

OpenStudio 1.3.0 introduces drag, drop and configuration capabilities to model the energy use of common commercial refrigeration systems (e.g. display cases and walk in coolers), including cascading systems. While this is not unique, the ability to integrate the energy impacts of refrigeration systems into a building?s heat balance at an adjustable sub-hourly time step provides tightly coupled feedback for estimating the interactions between energy systems.

Support for modeling VRF HVAC systems

OpenStudio provides drag, drop and configure capabilities for modeling VRF (Variable Flow Refrigerant) HVAC systems and controls of varying complexity. VRF systems can be configured to operate in either a ?heat pump? mode, (where the system operates in either heating or cooling mode) or in a heat recovery mode (where indoor units can recover and exchange heat with other indoor units operating in the opposite mode). In addition, the outdoor units can be configured to be air, water or evaporative cooled. User defined performance curves (generated from manufacturers published performance data) can now be used to describe equipment performance.

Support for modeling supply and return plenum configurations

Forced Air HVAC systems commonly use plenums for supplying and/or returning the conditioned air. This release of OpenStudio allows users to define and configure supply and return plenums that serve multiple conditioned zones. Plenums are considered unconditioned thermal zones and are composed of children OpenStudio spaces.  The plenum zones can leverage OpenStudio?s space type definitions for rapid object and property assignments.

Best,

Marek Loder
Manager, Strategy and Marketing

I was told by an EnergyPro user that when the software auto-generates input files for App G baselines, there is no way to inform it that a zone is "exceptional" and should be given its own System 3 or 4. It apparently does not attempt to do this on its own, either. Can anyone tell me if this is really true?

All,

I am trying to determine the impact of switching an already built energy model which follows ASHRAE 90.1 2007 (LEED 2009) to ASHRAE 90.1 2010 (LEED V4).

I know that at face value, this will likely negatively impact the percent energy cost savings that I have been able to show. The LEED V4 point-system is different, so it might not impact the savings quite so adversely.

Any advice or quick thoughts?

Much appreciated,

Is this LEED-CI, or NC/CS/etc?  Modeling for LEED-CI under v4 is an
entirely different animal.  NC/CS not as much so.

 

90.1-2010 requires auto-receptacle control, daylight harvesting for
zones with > 250 SF of window area, etc.  Lots of control changes like
that, but nothing that would make you redo the basic structure of an
NC/CS model.

Hi, all,

Any pointer to the data source of emission coefficient of CO2, NOx and SOx
for major cities in *China*?

For the US., a counterpart guidance document would be: Source Energy and
Emission Factors for Energy Use in Buildings by NREL.

Thanks,

Qinpeng,
I found a recent article stating that Beijing was only recently requiring municipalities to report GHG emissions.
http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/china-carbon-idUSL3N0MF29820140318

It will probably be a couple of years before official government figures are available.  That said, you may be able to find information on criteria pollutants as they usually have more established reporting processes.  You might have to check with some environmental watchdogs or Chinese universities to find much on carbon emissions I'm thinking.  Best of luck,

Hi Qinpeng,

It will be difficult to get something equivalent to the document that you are referring to for China.
However, for CO2 conversion factor across the whole China you may want to have a look at the spreadsheet that comes together with this IEA publication:

"IEA (2012). CO2 emissions from fuel combustion highlights. International Energy Agency (IEA) Statistics, 2012 edition."

Best regards,
Georgios

Message-ID: <0EA9E4A184B01D468EA29CEFC03EA58F923B20@SBS1.DesignEngineersPC.local>

Hello Bldg-simers,

I am modeling a discharge air temperature reset strategy in TRACE based on worst case zone, resetting a maximum of 5 degrees.  The particular ECM is for a facility served by a central plant (steam and chilled water).  I am currently seeing electricity and steam savings, however I am also seeing a chilled water penalty.  Has anyone experienced this before or have an explanation as to why this might be?

Thanks,
Joe

Subject: [Bldg-sim] [ANNOUNCEMENT] Eppy - Open Source scripting language for
	Energyplus
Message-ID: <1397760491.11227.YahooMailNeo@web141201.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Eppy
Eppy is a scripting language for EnergyPlus idf files, and EnergyPlus output files. Eppy is written in the programming language Python. As a result it takes full advantage of the rich data structure and idioms that are avaliable in python. You can programmatically navigate, search, and modify EnergyPlus idf files using eppy. The power of using a scripting language allows you to do the following:
	* Make a large number of changes in an idf file with a few lines of eppy code.
	* Use conditions and filters when making changes to an idf file
	* Make changes to multiple idf files.
	* Read data from the output files of a EnergyPlus simulation run.
	* Based on the results of a EnergyPlus simulation run, generate the input file for the next simulation run.
So what does this matter? Here are some of the things you can do with eppy:
	* Change construction for all north facing walls.
	* Change the glass type for all windows larger than 2 square meters.
	* Change the number of people in all the interior zones.
	* Change the lighting power in all south facing zones.
	* Change the efficiency and fan power of all rooftop units.
	* Find the energy use of all the models in a folder (or of models that were run after a certain date)
You can install from :?https://pypi.python.org/pypi/eppy/0.4.6
The documentation is at:?http://pythonhosted.org//eppy/
to get a quick sense of how it feels to use eppy, take a look at?http://pythonhosted.org//eppy/Main_Tutorial.html
email?me if you run into any issues.
Put "eppy" in the subject line (the spam filter tends to be rather aggressive, and I might have to look in the junk folder)

The code is hosted on github <https://github.com/santoshphilip/eppy>, in case you want to grab the latest code. It is under active development


--------------------------

Some background to the project

Eppy was developed over the last year, for the ASHRAE 1651-RP research project that required modifying large number of files and analyzing the results.
Eppy was partially funded by ASHRAE
The original code was written in 2004 as a text interface for Energyplus and the scripting language was built on it's foundations
The open source license is GPLv3

The code has been heavily used and is very robust and stable
It works for all versions of Energyplus. It is designed to to work without modifications on future versions too.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Updated Radiance Installers Available
Message-ID: <CF75FF65.6CED%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Greetings, ray wranglers.

We are pleased to announce the availability of fresh Radiance installers for Windows, OSX, and Linux, on the NREL Radiance Git mirror (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance<https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.a.4>).  This new batch of installers is based on our tag 4.2.a.4 (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.a.4 ) which was created today, and includes all updates to HEAD as of this morning. These tags are *unofficial* snapshots of the *official* LBNL Radiance source tree (HEAD), located at: http://radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/?pathrev=MAIN.

A couple of things worth noting for this release:
* The Windows installer now optionally adds the Radiance "bin" directory to the user or system %PATH%, and creates a %RAYPATH% environment variable and sets it to  the Radiance "lib" directory.
* A couple of nifty new utilities written by Axel Jacobs are included, ltview.pl and ltpict.pl. They work similarly to objview and objpict, but are intended for visualizing luminaires (there's a manpage for each =)). ltview.pl supersedes the "-l" option to objview.rb that was added last year, and therefore objview.rb has been removed from the Radiance source.
* As always, see the release notes for more info: https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/blob/4.2.a.4/doc/notes/ReleaseNotes

Follow the photons, people.

Message-ID: <AF7766FF9623CB419803ECF0D4FF04F20729EA61@UUSNWE1N.na.utcmail.com>

I'm trying to reduce the annual energy use of some DOAS/ERV fans which will run at constant volume 24/7 365 days per year.

Right now we have 3.5" TSP on the supply/OA and 2.25" TSP on the exhaust. I'm looking at some of the obvious measures to reduce the design static.

Right now the fan efficiencies in this unit are in the mid to low 50%s. The fans are part of the ERV and are just described as "forward curved;" I didn't think a squirrel cage fan could handle that static but whatever they have is rated for it.

So, would any of the designers on this list have specific suggestions for ERVs with fans that would be more efficient at these conditions?

We have moved away from selecting ERVs with fans because we can't find any
that we're satisfied with.  We generally spec the BPE heat exchangers
because the pressure drop is extremely low for the high heat recovery
performance.  For fans we usually use the Greenheck SQ-VG series (or the
loren cook equivalent) with ECM motors or the TMI/ZA series.  Both of them
are very efficient, but the TMI/ZA fans are a bit better.   I think you'll
probably want to go with the TMI/ZA fans with that much static.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DesignBuilder training just six weeks away - register
	soon
Message-ID: <01ee01cf5e27$663d69b0$32b83d10$@naturalintelligence.us>

Space is limited so you do not want to wait until the last minute to register for this course.

The training will be run using the new version 4 of DesignBuilder and will cover many of the new and enhanced features such as the new geometric modeller with enhanced block geometry editing, the ability to mirror blocks, add individual surfaces, and produce cut-away/section visualizations.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days.

The course is organized so that architects could attend only the first 2-3 days and the last 2 days are specific to engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Dates: Monday - Friday, June 2 - 6, 2014

Venue: American Institute of Architects, 1735 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20006-5292 <http://www.aia.org/about/directions/index.htm> 

Cost: $299 per day. Discounts are available for booking 4 or more days or if more than one person from your organization will attend. Please contact us for details of how to obtain a discount for multiple bookings or for any other information about the course.

Additional course information and registration <http://designbuilderusa.com/training/designbuilder-simulation-training-days> .

Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use, most powerful graphical user interface to EnergyPlus available and includes ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G Baseline HVAC System templates, materials, and construction libraries.

Questions regarding the training may be sent to trainer at designbuilderusa.com or you may telephone 415-531-4610.

Message-ID: <5357F8D0.50202@gard.com>

For the past several years there have been two annual releases of DOE?s 
energy simulation engine EnergyPlus, in April and October. In 2014, we 
are skipping the April release. EnergyPlus has recently been translated 
from FORTRAN to C++ (see announcement at 
http://energy.gov/eere/articles/energyplus-boosts-building-efficiency-help-autodesk), 
and additional time was needed to complete the transition which included 
not only the program itself but also its development environment and 
processes. The transition is expected to be fully complete in the 
summer. The next EnergyPlus release will be in the fall of 2014, and we 
hope to announce a firm date?as well as new features?in the next month 
or two.

Dear Michael Witte,

In the new EnergyPlus version, will there be significant changes in the IDF
Editor such as the general class structure, the way the objects are created
under each class etc.? In other words, would the interfaces written based
on the objects of IDF Editor have to go through drastic changes or do overs
in order to work with the new EnergyPlus version? I would appreciate it
very much if you could give us a little information about these points.

Thanks in advance,
Best Regards,
Simge Andolsun, PhD.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LIVE Demo - New Features in OpenStudio v1.3.0
Message-ID: <CF8425FF.5777C%dtan@psdconsulting.com>

[http://psdconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/openstudio-training.jpg]

Join PSD next week on May 6th, 2014 from 1:00-2:00pm EDT for a free LIVE demonstration of the most exciting new features in OpenStudio v1.3.0.  As a licensed OpenStudio training and support organization, PSD is offering this webinar to raise awareness of the potential power of OpenStudio. The webinar will be led by PSD?s Vice President of Research and Development, Chris Balbach.

Sign up for the free webinar here: https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/375878706

Features that will be covered:

1) Support for modeling refrigeration systems:

OpenStudio 1.3.0 introduces drag, drop and configuration capabilities to model the energy use of common commercial refrigeration systems (e.g. display cases and walk in coolers), including cascading systems. While this is not unique, the ability to integrate the energy impacts of refrigeration systems into a building?s heat balance at an adjustable sub-hourly time step provides tightly coupled feedback for estimating the interactions between energy systems.

2) Support for modeling VRF HVAC systems

OpenStudio provides drag, drop and configure capabilities for modeling VRF (Variable Flow Refrigerant) HVAC systems and controls of varying complexity. VRF systems can be configured to operate in either a ?heat pump? mode, (where the system operates in either heating or cooling mode) or in a heat recovery mode (where indoor units can recover and exchange heat with other indoor units operating in the opposite mode). In addition, the outdoor units can be configured to be air, water or evaporative cooled. User defined performance curves (generated from manufacturers published performance data) can now be used to describe equipment performance.

3) Support for modeling supply and return plenum configurations

Forced Air HVAC systems commonly use plenums for supplying and/or returning the conditioned air. This release of OpenStudio allows users to define and configure supply and return plenums that serve multiple conditioned zones. Plenums are considered unconditioned thermal zones and are composed of children OpenStudio spaces.  The plenum zones can leverage OpenStudio?s space type definitions for rapid object and property assignments.

4) Support for incorporating ASHRAE Advanced Energy Design Guides (AEDG) 50% measures

Thirty seven new OpenStudio measures from the ASHRAE K-2 and Small to Medium Office 50% AEDG have been added to the NREL BCL public measures library. These measures represent performance descriptions matching the published documents.  As such, these measures contain the logic needed to easily & consistently transform OpenStudio models to evaluate potential savings from incorporating high performance building and system components.  Easy application (drag and drop) of these measure to YOUR models will be demonstrated.

Visit http://openstudiotraining.com/ to learn more about OpenStudio.

Best,
David

Message-ID: <2E68197026D1FA4CB47E994E31D4A50A0B14614B@EX10MBOX06.pnnl.gov>

Funded through DOE's Building Energy Codes Program, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) developed a suite of prototype building models to support the development of ASHRAE Standard 90.1. These prototype buildings-derived from DOE's Commercial Reference Building Models-cover 80% of the commercial building floor area in the United States for new construction, including both commercial buildings and mid- to high-rise residential buildings, across all U.S. climate zones.

 As Standard 90.1 evolves and EnergyPlus is updated, PNNL makes modifications to the commercial prototype building models, with extensive input from ASHRAE 90.1 Standing Standards Project Committee members and other building industry experts. Updated models have recently been posted including the following major updates:

1. Standard 90.1-2013 models

2. EnergyPlus Version 8.0

3. TMY3 weather data.

 The prototype models include 16 commercial building types in 17 climate locations for the four most recent editions of Standard 90.1 (2004, 2007, 2010, and 2013). The current combination results in an overall set of 1,088 total building models. The building models and accompanying documentation can be downloaded at https://www.energycodes.gov/development/commercial/90.1_models

I am simulating an existing building in Revit 2014, can anybody guide me
what thermal properties i should use for building envelope? Should i use
typical values or should i have to measure physically? Walls are made up of
concrete blocks with plaster on both sides and slab is RCC.

>  Join PSD next week on May 6th, 2014 from 1:00-2:00pm EDT for a free LIVE
> demonstration of the most exciting new features in OpenStudio v1.3.0.  As a
> licensed OpenStudio training and support organization, PSD is offering this
> webinar to raise awareness of the potential power of OpenStudio. The
> webinar will be led by PSD?s Vice President of Research and Development,
> Chris Balbach.

> https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/375878706
>
>  *Features that will be covered: *
>
>  *1) Support for modeling refrigeration systems:  *
>
>  OpenStudio 1.3.0 introduces drag, drop and configuration capabilities to
> model the energy use of common commercial refrigeration systems (e.g.
> display cases and walk in coolers), including cascading systems. While this
> is not unique, the ability to integrate the energy impacts of refrigeration
> systems into a building?s heat balance at an adjustable sub-hourly time
> step provides tightly coupled feedback for estimating the interactions
> between energy systems.
>
>  *2) Support for modeling VRF HVAC systems  *
>
>  OpenStudio provides drag, drop and configure capabilities for modeling
> VRF (Variable Flow Refrigerant) HVAC systems and controls of varying
> complexity. VRF systems can be configured to operate in either a ?heat
> pump? mode, (where the system operates in either heating or cooling mode)
> or in a heat recovery mode (where indoor units can recover and exchange
> heat with other indoor units operating in the opposite mode). In addition,
> the outdoor units can be configured to be air, water or evaporative cooled.
> User defined performance curves (generated from manufacturers published
> performance data) can now be used to describe equipment performance.
>
>  *3) Support for modeling supply and return plenum configurations  *
>
>  Forced Air HVAC systems commonly use plenums for supplying and/or
> returning the conditioned air. This release of OpenStudio allows users to
> define and configure supply and return plenums that serve multiple
> conditioned zones. Plenums are considered unconditioned thermal zones and
> are composed of children OpenStudio spaces.  The plenum zones can leverage
> OpenStudio?s space type definitions for rapid object and property
> assignments.
>
>  *4) Support for incorporating ASHRAE Advanced Energy Design Guides
> (AEDG) 50% measures*
>
>  Thirty seven new OpenStudio measures from the ASHRAE K-2 and Small to
> Medium Office 50% AEDG have been added to the NREL BCL public measures
> library. These measures represent performance descriptions matching the
> published documents.  As such, these measures contain the logic needed to *easily
> & consistently* transform OpenStudio models to evaluate potential savings
> from incorporating high performance building and system components.  Easy
> application (drag and drop) of these measure to YOUR models will be
> demonstrated.

> Subject: [Bldg-sim] Updated Standard 90.1 Prototype Building Models
> Available
>
> Funded through DOE's Building Energy Codes Program, Pacific Northwest
> National Laboratory (PNNL) developed a suite of prototype building models
> to support the development of ASHRAE Standard 90.1. These prototype
> buildings?derived from DOE's Commercial Reference Building Models?cover 80%
> of the commercial building floor area in the United States for new
> construction, including both commercial buildings and mid- to high-rise
> residential buildings, across all U.S. climate zones.
>
>  As Standard 90.1 evolves and EnergyPlus is updated, PNNL makes
> modifications to the commercial prototype building models, with extensive
> input from ASHRAE 90.1 Standing Standards Project Committee members and
> other building industry experts. Updated models have recently been posted
> including the following major updates:
>
> 1. Standard 90.1-2013 models
>
> 2. EnergyPlus Version 8.0
>
> 3. TMY3 weather data.
>
>  The prototype models include 16 commercial building types in 17 climate
> locations for the four most recent editions of Standard 90.1 (2004, 2007,
> 2010, and 2013). The current combination results in an overall set of 1,088
> total building models. The building models and accompanying documentation
> can be downloaded at

Subject: [Bldg-sim] energy for museum and conference room
Message-ID: <CALgQ-nJmWc7eh3t2rr5vXtDm2g6te8eK=SvrRhow3qEwf03jxg@mail.gmail.com>

I need to get data concerning the average energy consumption of museums and
conference rooms. The buildings should not be particularly energy
inefficient. In fact, my goal is to predict, very approximately, the energy
consumption of a building that is going to be designed in the next months.
Getting a range of possible values would be great. The data should be
divided in heating, cooling, ventilation, hot water, lighting, process
energy. In http://buildingsdatabook.eren.doe.gov/ I have found interesting
data, but not specifically relative to museums and conference rooms. Where
could I find a database or a study that could help me, please?
With Regards

Hi Francesco,

Check out Energy Star's Target Finder tool (http://1.usa.gov/1meKa2p). It 
appears to have museums as a primary function and it also has convention 
center which may be the closest thing to conference room other than office 
type.

I hope that helps.
