I've noticed that the list of qualified software does not include eQuest
but does include VisualDOE.  Is eQuest going to be on this list at some
point soon or is it already approved since it uses nearly the same
engine as VisualDOE?

Thanks,

Mike,

There are two ways to do the light energy saving right now.  One is
based
on the whole building energy and power cost; you must reach 16-2/3 %
saving
based on the whole building.  Another way is based on light design
prescription per ASHRAE 90.1-2001; you must reach 30% ~ 50% saving based
on
ASHRAE.  See IRS Notice 2006-52 from its web site for detail.

Our perception is the whole building has to be calculated.  It will be
interesting to see other input.

Hello All,


I'm working with a customer who did a lighting retrofit and it meets the
50% improvement over 90.1 2001 for the $.60/sf. My question is, how in
do I
document this for the accountants? It's just lighting so do I still need
to
do the whole building through one of the approved simulation soft wares
or
can I just do some sort of calculation by hand? Any help would be
greatly
appreciated.


Thanks,
Mike

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702281612.AA1221468pd80001378959@gard.com>

Thanks Steve,

Describing the last problem became strangely convoluted, so let me see
if I can simplify:


Baseline:
* Two 40,000 CFM air handlers with DX cooling and hot water heating
* Supply & return static 5.5" and 2.5" respectively

Parametric:
* A runaround heat recovery circuit for each; pumped glycol with two
8-row coils
* Heat recovery coils in outside and exhaust air streams continuously
(no bypass)
* Heat recovery coils have pressure drop of 1/2" each; additional
allowance for filters not required


So, my simplified question is:  In the parametric run for the above
system, should supply & return statics 1) be set to 6" and 3"
respectively and ERV pressure drops zeroed out, or 2) should the ERV
pressure drops be set to 1/2" and the supply and return statics left
as-is?

My thinking is that scenario 1 is a better approach for this
application, given the in-line runaround circuit configuration.  


All of this to me segues into two more questions:  

1) Does setting ERV-MOTOR-CLASS to PREMIUM while ERV-FANS are set to
HVAC-SUPPLY/RETURN improve the main air handler motor efficiency
regardless of whether the ERV function is engaged or not?  

2) For other motors in the project that we would like to specify as
premium efficiency, are high- and premium-efficiency motor curves built
into the program?  We briefly looked in the library, but didn't see
them.  If not, are they perhaps available somewhere online?


Thanks very much in advance...

Brandon Nichols



Parametric BDL for Scenario #1
Heat Recovery  coils inline with air handler, no bypass:

   RECOVER-EXHAUST  = YES

While we're on it...

Can anyone confirm the Interim Rule is still valid as a pathway to
receiving EPACT 2005 tax credits which would mean only the Permanent
Rule is in effect?

(b) Interim Rule. 
Partially qualifying property, within the meaning of section 2.01 of
this notice, is subject to the interim rule if it is not subject to the
permanent rule in section 2.03(1)(a) of this notice, if it is installed
as part of the interior lighting systems of a building before the date
on which final regulations under section 179D are published in the
Federal Register, and it is certified that the interior lighting systems
that have been incorporated into the building, or that the taxpayer
plans to incorporate into the building

Second, if the Interim Rule is currently an option based on LPD
reductions, can that reduction be based on aggregate lighting power
density? Or does it mandate a space-by-space calculation of LPD?

Mike,

There are two ways to do the light energy saving right now.  One is based
on the whole building energy and power cost; you must reach 16-2/3 % saving
based on the whole building.  Another way is based on light design
prescription per ASHRAE 90.1-2001; you must reach 30% ~ 50% saving based on
ASHRAE.  See IRS Notice 2006-52 from its web site for detail.

Hello All,


I'm working with a customer who did a lighting retrofit and it meets the
50% improvement over 90.1 2001 for the $.60/sf. My question is, how in do I
document this for the accountants? It's just lighting so do I still need to
do the whole building through one of the approved simulation soft wares or
can I just do some sort of calculation by hand? Any help would be greatly
appreciated.


Thanks,
Mike

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702281220.AA2058390pd80001378520@gard.com>

Thanks Steven and Mitchell

Excellent information, which I will compile/condense (with source credits, of course) and share on my energy modeling blog @ http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com

Steve, your discussion of ERV assumptions caused me to rethink my simulation, from the perspective that my heat recovery coils are always in the air stream of the main air handlers.  So the 1/2" pressure drop across the heat recovery coils should be subtracted from the base case main air handlers, and added back in the parametric run, and presumably the ERV coil pressure drops zeroed-out.  

Curiously however, when I zero out the ERV pressure drops, set the base case SUPPLY-STATIC to 5.5" and RETURN-STATIC to 2.5", and use the parameters listed below in a comparison run, then according to the simulation the annual savings is 20% GREATER than than it was with SUPPLY-STATIC 6.0", RETURN-STATIC was 3.0" and the pressure drop across ERV coils were 0.5" each.

This is not coincident with my expectations, as I would expect additional energy recovery pressure drop to be experienced whenever the main air handlers are running in the former case, but only when the ERV is operational in the latter case -- resulting in the annual energy savings of the former case the LESS than that of the latter.

Any insights?  Much appreciated...

Subject: RE: [BLDG-SIM] eQuest 100% OSA & Heat Recovery with System Type PZRH & SZRH Only?

Our research at the time we implemented the eQUEST/DOE-2 algorithm (approx 10 years ago) showed that 1" was typical.  However, that static did not include any pressure drop for filters upstream of both the exhaust and the OA inlets.  

Some manufacturers of heat-wheel ERVs state the wheels are "self cleaning", as the airflow reverses as the wheel rotates through each air stream.  I haven't seen one of these operating after 5 years without filters, so I don't know whether this is a valid claim or not.

My understanding is that all other types need a filter on each airstream or they will plug up over time.  The typical 30% filter has a pressure drop of about 0.5".  So the total pressure drop is on the order of 1.5"  Hence the
DOE-2 default.

The energy savings of an ERV is highly dependent on how it is controlled.
If it simply runs all hours of fan operation (the eQUEST default), it will almost certainly use more energy than it saves.  

Why such a poor default operating mode in eQUEST?  Our logic at the time was that, if the designer does not think about and specify the required control sequence, then the unit would be installed in the cheapest way possible, which is to simply interlock operation with the HVAC fans.  I have observed ERVs that run in exactly this manner...

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQuest 100% OSA & Heat Recovery with System Type PZRH & SZRH Only?

Hello All,

First some generally useful information to model heat recovery parametrically.  The following parametric components were used to obtain about $5,000 savings on a $90,000 per year utility bill in the Pacific Northwest on a 'PSZ' system.  Most of them don't make much difference, the keys are the static pressure drops across the recovery coils, specified to be 0.5" in the HVAC design.  If the pressure drops are left at the eQuest defaults of 1.5", the system does not exhibit any net savings... all of the conserved natural gas is burned up in fan energy. 

RECOVER-EXHAUST  = YES
ERV-RECOVER-TYPE = SENSIBLE-HX
ERV-RUN-CTRL     = OA-EXHAUST-DT
ERV-RECOVER-MODE = OA-HEAT/COOL
ERV-TEMP-CTRL    = FLOAT
ERV-CAP-CTRL     = MODULATE-HX
ERV-MOTOR-CLASS  = PREMIUM
ERV-OA-STATIC    = 0.5
ERV-EXH-STATIC   = 0.5
ERV-FROST-CTRL   = USE-CAP-CTRL


So does this essentially answer my own question, just set the statics right and any system can be modeled with heat recovery?  I think the answer is 'no', because believe me I tried... there seems to me some deeper issues heat recovery-wise with some of the systems in eQuest/DOE2, not issues with the software necessarily, just issues I don't yet fully understand... hence any insights still appreciated.
  

BTW, all references in previous message to 'PZRH' system should've been 'PSZ'

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQuest 100% OSA & Heat Recovery with System Type PZRH & SZRH Only?

Hello All,

In simulating a 100% outside air heat recovery system with multistage DX cooling and supply air reset capability (40,000 CFM x2 units, in my mind a couple of big PVVTs), it was most time-consuming to learn by trial-and-error that heat recovery does not seem to work as expected for certain types of systems.  For the PVVT, PVAV, and VAV system types the baseline system would always outperform the heat recovery system, despite numerous iterations of parameter tweaking, and even if 'extreme measures' such as high internal heat loads were applied to force a large delta-T.

However when I at last selected a packaged or single zone reheat (PZRH or SZRH, after getting a clue from the BLDG-SIM archives)... Voil?!, reasonable results are instantly obtained.

My question is... do we need to stick to a list of simple systems when simulating heat recovery, regardless of whether its a 100% outside air system?  If so, does anyone have a list? So far, my list consists of just PZRH and SZRH, which seems a bit limiting.

Any empirical or quantitative insight into the mysterious inner workings of eQuest that would account for these observations much appreciated...

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702281113.AA1315296pd80001378444@gard.com>

Our research at the time we implemented the eQUEST/DOE-2 algorithm (approx
10 years ago) showed that 1" was typical.  However, that static did not
include any pressure drop for filters upstream of both the exhaust and the
OA inlets.  

Some manufacturers of heat-wheel ERVs state the wheels are "self cleaning",
as the airflow reverses as the wheel rotates through each air stream.  I
haven't seen one of these operating after 5 years without filters, so I
don't know whether this is a valid claim or not.

My understanding is that all other types need a filter on each airstream or
they will plug up over time.  The typical 30% filter has a pressure drop of
about 0.5".  So the total pressure drop is on the order of 1.5"  Hence the
DOE-2 default.

The energy savings of an ERV is highly dependent on how it is controlled.
If it simply runs all hours of fan operation (the eQUEST default), it will
almost certainly use more energy than it saves.  

Why such a poor default operating mode in eQUEST?  Our logic at the time was
that, if the designer does not think about and specify the required control
sequence, then the unit would be installed in the cheapest way possible,
which is to simply interlock operation with the HVAC fans.  I have observed
ERVs that run in exactly this manner...

Hello All,

First some generally useful information to model heat recovery
parametrically.  The following parametric components were used to obtain
about $5,000 savings on a $90,000 per year utility bill in the Pacific
Northwest on a 'PSZ' system.  Most of them don't make much difference, the
keys are the static pressure drops across the recovery coils, specified to
be 0.5" in the HVAC design.  If the pressure drops are left at the eQuest
defaults of 1.5", the system does not exhibit any net savings... all of the
conserved natural gas is burned up in fan energy. 

RECOVER-EXHAUST  = YES
ERV-RECOVER-TYPE = SENSIBLE-HX
ERV-RUN-CTRL     = OA-EXHAUST-DT
ERV-RECOVER-MODE = OA-HEAT/COOL
ERV-TEMP-CTRL    = FLOAT
ERV-CAP-CTRL     = MODULATE-HX
ERV-MOTOR-CLASS  = PREMIUM
ERV-OA-STATIC    = 0.5
ERV-EXH-STATIC   = 0.5
ERV-FROST-CTRL   = USE-CAP-CTRL


So does this essentially answer my own question, just set the statics right
and any system can be modeled with heat recovery?  I think the answer is
'no', because believe me I tried... there seems to me some deeper issues

But it is definitely more oriented for commercial, do you need

Hello all...
 
I am modeling (eQuest) a ~7000sf office building-one main level above
grade and a smaller mechanical space above (approximately 25% of main
level floor area). The mechanical space is to be heat-only (but is
understood under appendix-g that this will be modeled as both htg&clg),
is enclosed, and located within the attic space below the roof. All
seems to be well and good until looking at the simulation output where
there is no load contribution from the roof (hipped). Wall/Ceiling
heights have been adjusted with no change under this type of roof.
 
Hoping this proves to be as basic as assumed it is-any suggestions are
welcome.
 
Thanks in advance,

Hi Tom
 
I participated in the compilation of a good reference book, maybe more
of a reference for your class than a mandatory textbook, but excellent
for setting the appropriate context for renewable energy systems if they
are to satisfy the majority (if not all) of building needs.
 
"A handbook on Low-Energy Buildings and District Energy Systems" Edited
by Danny Harvey from University of Toronto. Published by Earthscan in
the UK. ISBN 1-84407-243-6.
 
Good general principles discussions. Cold climate and warm climate
applications. Summaries of examples and impacts of codes and standards.
 
Regards,
SFP

Greetings fellow BLDG-SIMmers,
 
Here's a question I'm hoping you all might be able to help me with. I
have the opportunity to teach a class spring quarter on energy modeling
and energy-efficient building design at our local technical college.
Students are juniors and seniors earning their degrees in renewable
energy engineering. 
 
Although I have plenty of reports and websites I can use for references
and resources, but I'd be interested in any recommendations you might
have for a suitable *textbook* on this subject. If you could go even one
better and suggest where/from whom I might get a desk copy for review,
I'd be much obliged.
 
Thanks for all your input. I'll be glad to follow up summarize your
suggestions in BLDG-SIM.

The "ASHRAE GreenGuide: The Design, Construction, and Operation of
Sustainable Buildings" might be a good book for an overview of what goes
into sustainable design.  I'm not sure where you could find a desk copy
to review though and I don't know if you would classify it as a
"textbook".  I'd be interested to hear what you end up going with.  Good
luck.

I did some research on a reversible window, A window similar to the commercially available double-hung but can "rotate" to make the low-E coating on surface 2 in summer and on surface 3 in winter. The window was tested on a test cell and simulated on energy-Plus. There is a significant reduction in heating load or cooling load in moderate climates. This paper will hopefully be published soon. In addition, this window will increase the mean Radiant temperature in winter (provide comfort on a lower air temperature) and reduce condensation on windows.

This has also been documented in a MS thesis on the ESL's web site, specifically one that looked at switchable glazing by Ms. Jaya Mukhopadhyay. This simulation analysis showed interactions with thermal mass and thermostat settings were also important with large errors when one used pre-calculated weighting factors vs CWFs.

An interesting (or possibly pointless) anecdote:

When I was at ENSAR, we were doing a glazing analysis for a project in Hawaii looking at different glass properties, U-value being one of them. I turn out that not only is there a diminishing return with increased insulation, there are times when you actually lose performance with an increase in insulation. The reduced insulation increased the building balance point enough to allow the outside air temperature to cool the building. Of course - this was in Hawaii, where more than 90% of the year you are within the ASHRAE comfort zone sitting under a tree.

Hi Micha,

As Vikram said, it depends. To give an example, we measured the heating consumption of two identical buildings (one bare, the other insulated with 8 cm thick EPS boards) for 6 months in Northeastern Turkey, where the annual mean temperature is about 6 Celsius. The average reduction in heating energy was 54 %. Depending on the U-value of the bare wall, this may practically change between 30 and 65 %.

If your building is located at a relatively warm region, increasing the thickness of the insulation will not have much effect on results. Also, ventilation frequency should be realistic.

The best answer to this would be "It depends".

There are multiple factors that would affect it (skin dominant v/s core dominant), climate, and possibly even usage.

Hello there,

What would the reduction roughly be in energy consumption for using thermal 
insulation? I am trying to figure out whether or not my results are 
correct.. Could anyone give me an estimated percentage of such reduction?

My results show very small impact and I am not able to find where my errors 
might lie.

Many Thanks,

For what its worth, simulation runs used in preparation for the Jamaican 
Energy Efficiency Building Code showed that wall reflectance was more 
effective than thermal insulation in reducing cooling loads.

So, we are now allowed to use no insulation on walls, as long as they have 
low solar absorptance.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Reduction in Energy consumption?


An interesting (or possibly pointless) anecdote:

When I was at ENSAR, we were doing a glazing analysis for a project in 
Hawaii looking at different glass properties, U-value being one of them. I 
turn out that not only is there a diminishing return with increased 
insulation, there are times when you actually lose performance with an 
increase in insulation. The reduced insulation increased the building 
balance point enough to allow the outside air temperature to cool the 
building. Of course - this was in Hawaii, where more than 90% of the year 
you are within the ASHRAE comfort zone sitting under a tree.

Hi Micha,

As Vikram said, it depends. To give an example, we measured the heating 
consumption of two identical buildings (one bare, the other insulated with 8 
cm thick EPS boards) for 6 months in Northeastern Turkey, where the annual 
mean temperature is about 6 Celsius. The average reduction in heating energy 
was 54 %. Depending on the U-value of the bare wall, this may practically 
change between 30 and 65 %.

If your building is located at a relatively warm region, increasing the 
thickness of the insulation will not have much effect on results. Also, 
ventilation frequency should be realistic.

Konu: [BLDG-SIM] Reduction in Energy consumption?

The best answer to this would be "It depends".

There are multiple factors that would affect it (skin dominant v/s core 
dominant), climate, and possibly even usage.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Reduction in Energy consumption?

Hello there,

What would the reduction roughly be in energy consumption for using thermal
insulation? I am trying to figure out whether or not my results are
correct.. Could anyone give me an estimated percentage of such reduction?

My results show very small impact and I am not able to find where my errors
might lie.

Many Thanks,

Micha

Dear all,

I was going through the Architecture 2030 challenge targets but could not find energy performance benchmark for laboratory buildings. The labs21century.gov website has information about energy efficient lab design but I could not locate any quantitative benchmarks.


Any pointers to accepted benchmarks for lab buildings (specifically for midwest climate or otherwise) will be highly appreciated.

I implement an energy efficiency program for new construction (multifamily,
mixed use and commercial) and can provide insight on how our program is set
up, who our typical client is and when we are successful.

We provide incentives based on the calculated energy savings (kW, kWh and
Therms) using various modeling software programs, modeled against an
appropriate baseline.

If you want to contact me, I can share some thoughts on what timing and
market dynamics affect the incentives vs. adding first cost to the
construction budget.  The incentive impact changes based on what type of
building is being built, what happens to the building once it is completed
and the financial criteria of the building owner.

There are a number of papers on the LoanSTAR program available on our

web site. Several included WB elec, MCC, heat and cool, as well as L&R. 

 

There was also an EPA study on meas profiles for AHUs. Also, on-line. 

 

There is also the ASHRAE 1093 RP that had diversity factors from 40+

bldgs.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Studies with actual measured building consumption

 

Dear all

 

I am looking for studies that contain data on actual measured building

energy consumption, broken down by use (e.g. pumps, cooling towers,

cooling system, chillers, etc).  Is anyone aware of any studies (any

location worldwide) that may have this data? It would be necessary for

the study to have the date the study was performed, the type of system

used (eg VAV or constant volume), location, and actual measured energy

consumption.

 

Thanks for the help,

This can happen on the mainland too (and in real situations):

In mild climates, buildings with high nighttime 
internal gains (24 hour call centers, 24 hr 
retail, server farms, etc) and no economizers, 
will exhibit higher cooling energy use with 
higher insulation levels because the insulation 
inhibits the loss of heat to the cooler nighttime 
environment. This is especially true when looking 
at roof insulation levels under highly 
reflective, highly emissive roof coatings as 
these eliminate almost all of the direct solar 
gain, leaving mostly conduction and night-sky radiation.

This should only be a retrofit issue. In new 
construction, with a correctly designed building 
(working economizers) insulation should always 
help, but there is an optimal level.

I?ve heard of at least several studies linking using daylighting via skylights/exhibit windows and sales performance for retail stores.

 

Anyone know of anything.


Much appreciated.

Thanks everyone, I really appreciate it..

My results show 22% reduction in annual energy. It's a 500 m2 two-storey 
residential building located in Kuwait, where temperature sometimes exceeds 
48 Celsius in the summer and the mean temperature is between 20-25 C.. Also, 
5 cm of Polyurethane shows this type of result. Do you find this reduction 
odd? or normal?

What's the conversion unit of ach (infiltration) to CFM/ft2, as well as 
CFM/per (design ventilation) to SI Units?

Really appreciate it everyone!

Micha

An interesting (or possibly pointless) anecdote:

When I was at ENSAR, we were doing a glazing analysis for a project in Hawaii looking at different glass properties, U-value being one of them. I turn out that not only is there a diminishing return with increased insulation, there are times when you actually lose performance with an increase in insulation. The reduced insulation increased the building balance point enough to allow the outside air temperature to cool the building. Of course - this was in Hawaii, where more than 90% of the year you are within the ASHRAE comfort zone sitting under a tree.

Hi Micha,

As Vikram said, it depends. To give an example, we measured the heating consumption of two identical buildings (one bare, the other insulated with 8 cm thick EPS boards) for 6 months in Northeastern Turkey, where the annual mean temperature is about 6 Celsius. The average reduction in heating energy was 54 %. Depending on the U-value of the bare wall, this may practically change between 30 and 65 %.

If your building is located at a relatively warm region, increasing the thickness of the insulation will not have much effect on results. Also, ventilation frequency should be realistic.

Hi Micha,

As Vikram said, it depends. To give an example, we measured the heating consumption of two identical buildings (one bare, the other insulated with 8 cm thick EPS boards) for 6 months in Northeastern Turkey, where the annual mean temperature is about 6 Celsius. The average reduction in heating energy was 54 %. Depending on the U-value of the bare wall, this may practically change between 30 and 65 %.

If your building is located at a relatively warm region, increasing the thickness of the insulation will not have much effect on results. Also, ventilation frequency should be realistic.

Dear Micha

like Vikram said it depends on many things, in addition showing small impacts on heating or 
cooling energy demand? if heating, in my opinion you should check your inputs data etc. 
because even in warm climate it has impact..

The best answer to this would be "It depends".

There are multiple factors that would affect it (skin dominant v/s core dominant), climate, and possibly even usage.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Reduction in Energy consumption?
 
Hello there,

What would the reduction roughly be in energy consumption for using thermal 
insulation? I am trying to figure out whether or not my results are 
correct.. Could anyone give me an estimated percentage of such reduction?

My results show very small impact and I am not able to find where my errors 
might lie.

Many Thanks,

Micha

Micha,
 
Another thing you can check is the detailed report from the simulation for the wall and roof constructions (LV-D or LV-I).  See what the overall U-value of your walls/roof are for the two different runs.  Maybe there are other layers in your construction that are affecting the construction's thermal properties more than you think.  Hope you figure it out.
 
Regards,
Andrew

Hello everyone,

I have run a case using Detail Interface.. I used Schematic Wizard to input
my data and I used Detail Interface only for the walls and roof construction
(The materials I want are not included within the program). I first created
materials, then layers, then construction and finally assigned it to the
walls and roof.

The first run I put all my materials, for both walls and roof, without the
thermal insulation. I did this to see the effect of thermal insulation on
air-conditioned buildings, obviously. Then I re-ran the case with adding the
thermal insulation in both walls and roof construction.

The problem being is that I don't see any real effect in adding the
insulation. My results show that the difference between having and not
having thermal insulation is around 3 kWh, which is certainly nothing. I
used different insulations, only very slight change occured.

What should I do?

I will really appreciate it.

Micha

Two things,

1. eQuest can get a lil buggy when you switch from 1 wizard to
another, I suggest doing the whole thing in detailed design wizard.
2. The location of the building (climate) will also effect the
usefulness of insulation.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702231813.AA1337390pd80001375019@gard.com>

All,
 
Has anyone been able to successfully simulate a runaround heat recovery
circuit in eQuest?  It seems no matter what loop we choose for our
waterside heat recovery, program rejects it. 
 
Reading some other threads, it sounded like perhaps this waterside heat
recovery is only for chillers -- true?  If so, then there must be some
way to approximate a runaround heat recovery circuit using BDL.  
 
Before reinventing the wheel, thought I'd ask to see if anyone already
had one...

Used to be that you could do this by going to the shell tab and
clicking on the CAD drawing properties and selecting none. Recently I
have been unable to do that (I suspect its because I upgraded to eQUEST
v3.6, but I could be wrong). You can also do this by opening up the PD2

drawing and deleting it (that's the way I do it now).

I recently developed an eQuest model using CAD dwg files to enter floor
and space vertices. As it is a 3-story building with loads of
architecturally interesting features, one floor plan does not fit all
three floors. I created individual footprints for each floor (and for
each plenum, since the floor zoning translates to the plenum, which
would not match the zoning of the floor above), imported the
floor-by-floor models into the ground floor model, shifted origins to
get everything to stack up right (so I could see I hadn't missed
anything) and created thermal connections as appropriate. I am satisfied
with the results, however, each time I open the model I am informed that
the dwg files cannot be found, than asked if I would like to search for
them. There is a notification for each dwg file used and the model seems
to be completely insensitive to my verbal responses no matter their tone
or volume (my office mates seem to get the point...). Indeed, the dwg
files are no longer there, but then they are no longer necessary. The
model will be reviewed for LEED and there is no functional reason to
send the dwg files for the reviewer, so I would like to get rid of these
requests. Is there any way to cut these ties?
 
Thanks for any help.

Mike,

Indeed it is difficult to get all zones into the t-stat throttling range with 2-pipe fan coils; especially important for LEED certification if the building is being simulated based on ASHRAE Appendix G requirements.  I've tried the setting up the 2-pipe circulation loop control with a SNAP command and base it on outdoor air temp (55? F for Boston area) but the hours still exceed 3%.  I will try the SCHEDULE command to see if I get less under cooled/heated hours.

Thank you,

 

Jeff

Jeff,

 

My experience is that it takes some effort to properly calibrate a 2-pipe system in eQuest, especially if you're trying to get all your zones into the t-stat throttling range so you don't have a lot of unmet heating and cooling hours.  I've had the most success operating the 2-pipe circulation loop using the SCHEDULED command.  You can define a heating and cooling schedule of type ON/OFF/TEMP where the temp value you enter is either a zone or outside air lockout temp.  Leave yourself enough of a deadband to minimize bouncing back and forth between heating and cooling on an hourly basis.  You may also need to disable heating or cooling during certain parts of the year (ie: You may not want your system to switch from cooling to heating for 1-2 hours because of a cold August morning.)

	In eQuest I am attempting to model a proposed system that utilizes a 'well-water-to-water heat pump' type chiller that will be attached to a vertical well ground loop heat exchanger. The chillers are modular and cycle on and off to meet demand, so they operate at a constant efficiency.  They will be providing HW and CHW to 2-pipe fan coil units.  The DOE2.2 documentation indicates this chiller type is Heat-Pump and that this chiller type can only be attached to lake/well water loop.  By selecting the lake/well water loop, I am unable to define the vertical well characteristics, i.e well depth, configuration, etc.  Does anyone know of a way to attach the Heat-Pump type chiller to a vertical well system?  If not, is there a method to better describe the capacity of the lake/well loop?  And finally, does anyone have experience modeling this system type and can provide any insight?

zones into the t-stat throttling range so you don't have a lot of unmet
heating and cooling hours.  I've had the most success operating the
2-pipe circulation loop using the SCHEDULED command.  You can define a
heating and cooling schedule of type ON/OFF/TEMP where the temp value
you enter is either a zone or outside air lockout temp.  Leave yourself
enough of a deadband to minimize bouncing back and forth between heating
and cooling on an hourly basis.  You may also need to disable heating or
cooling during certain parts of the year (ie: You may not want your
system to switch from cooling to heating for 1-2 hours because of a cold
August morning.)

	Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Water-to-Water Heat Pump Chillers and GLHE's
	
	

	 

	In eQuest I am attempting to model a proposed system that
utilizes a 'well-water-to-water heat pump' type chiller that will be
attached to a vertical well ground loop heat exchanger. The chillers are
modular and cycle on and off to meet demand, so they operate at a
constant efficiency.  They will be providing HW and CHW to 2-pipe fan
coil units.  The DOE2.2 documentation indicates this chiller type is
Heat-Pump and that this chiller type can only be attached to lake/well
water loop.  By selecting the lake/well water loop, I am unable to
define the vertical well characteristics, i.e well depth, configuration,
etc.  Does anyone know of a way to attach the Heat-Pump type chiller to
a vertical well system?  If not, is there a method to better describe
the capacity of the lake/well loop?  And finally, does anyone have
experience modeling this system type and can provide any insight?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702231509.AA0918453pd80001374624@gard.com>

I recently developed an eQuest model using CAD dwg files to enter floor
and space vertices. As it is a 3-story building with loads of
architecturally interesting features, one floor plan does not fit all
three floors. I created individual footprints for each floor (and for
each plenum, since the floor zoning translates to the plenum, which
would not match the zoning of the floor above), imported the
floor-by-floor models into the ground floor model, shifted origins to
get everything to stack up right (so I could see I hadn't missed
anything) and created thermal connections as appropriate. I am satisfied
with the results, however, each time I open the model I am informed that
the dwg files cannot be found, than asked if I would like to search for
them. There is a notification for each dwg file used and the model seems
to be completely insensitive to my verbal responses no matter their tone
or volume (my office mates seem to get the point...). Indeed, the dwg
files are no longer there, but then they are no longer necessary. The
model will be reviewed for LEED and there is no functional reason to
send the dwg files for the reviewer, so I would like to get rid of these
requests. Is there any way to cut these ties?
 
Thanks for any help.

I'm modeling a project for LEED ECB compliance for a campus facility

water and steam meter functions before in eQUEST, I'm wondering if
anyone can give me some pointers on things to watch out for. How do you
document this in the ECB report? The steam & Chilled water meters only
give you a BTU output, and no dollar values. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

Jeff, the lake/well model is based on ground water circulating through
the chiller heat exchanger.  Therefore the main parameter is the water
temperature.  It sounds like you instead have a ground loop heat
exchanger, where the water is circulated through a closed loop pipe
located in the ground.  I don't believe you are able to use the heat
pump chiller type for that method of heat rejection.
 
One workaround might be that if you know what the water temperatures
will be in the GLHE you could input those monthly temperatures to the
lake/well model and use your model as you currently have it configured.
 
You could make a separate eQuest model using water-to-air heat pumps
(make sure to have the same outside air loads, compressor efficiencies
etc.) using the GLHE heat rejection with the details of your
actual/proposed well field to get some idea what the water temperatures
should be, then plug those temperatures into your WTWHP model using the
lake/well heat rejection.  Also you may want to simulate it with a
high/low range of monthly water temperatures to see how sensitive your
results are to this approximation.
 
You have to judge whether this will provide the accuracy you need for
your project.  Obviously you'll have to make adjustments for the pumping
energy to reflect your intentions.
 
Hope this helps!
 
David

Daylighting controls would only be used if your building/project was
utilizing daylighting as an energy efficiency measure.  When daylighting
sensors are specified in your energy model for a particular space, DOE
2.2 performs a calculation on the amount of natural light entering a
space and simulates the dimming or shutting off of lights (depending on
how you set it up), thus saving electricity.  So long story short, if
the primary focus of your model is the effect of insulation, skip the
daylighting calculation.  Hope this helps.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702221708.AA0838906pd80001373905@gard.com>

Hi everyone,

What's the effect of having Daylighting Controls? Any clarification?

I am modelling a two-storey residential building and my primary focus is the 
effect of insulation in walls and roof.

Thanks in advance!

Mich

John -
 
It sounds like the plenums are associated with the systems serving the
respective floor areas (the eQuest default as far as I can tell). If you
look down the page, all the parameters associated with the plenum zones
(SUPPLY FLOW, EXHAUST FLOW, etc) should be zero, so they aren't
affecting the energy consumption of the system. I am assuming you
divided the building into two equal-area wings, so adding the true floor
area and the associated plenum's area coincides with the building's
total floor area. I don't think there is any problem with removing the
plenum zones from the existing systems and associating them with a new
system (SYSTEM-TYPE = SUM). My understanding is that this system type
doesn't address any loads but is used for diagnostics. Then the square
footage for your systems should be the expected 40,000 sqft each in
SV-A. Hope this halps.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] I've got a GOOD eQuest question..


I simulated an 80,000 sq.ft building, a two wing, three story building.
Each three story wing is to have it's own fan system (ASHRAE-90.1-2004
requires it to be Package VAV). So I set it up this way, and
successfully ran the model.
 
The Ls-C output, I am told, is the only place in the model where the
conditioned sq.ft is shown. 80,000 sq.ft, lo and behold.
 
But THEN I went to SV-A, two of them one for each fan system. BOTH of
the sq.ft shown on were 80,000 sq.ft
 
The DOE-2 help for DOE-2.2/eQuest says the following for the SV-A report
(and I quote):
------------------------------------------------------------------------

System-Level Design Values

SYSTEM TYPE

is the code-word identifying the type of system.  

ALTITUDE FACTOR

is the altitude adjustment factor for air flows; it multiplies air flows
at sea level to get air flows at the actual altitude of the building.

FLOOR AREA

is the total floor area of all zones served by the system that have
ZONE-TYPE = CONDITIONED or UNCONDITIONED, or, for ZONE-TYPE = PLENUM,
that have non-zero occupancy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My plenums are shown as zero occupancy.

So WHY does it seem to be counting them as part of the Floor Area ????

The Therm software publicly available from the Windows & Daylighting  
group at LBNL allows a 2D finite element analysis of frames / thermal  
bridging.  I have used this to look at aluminium and concrete thermal  
bridging to arrive at "effective" insulation values.  I use this  
information to adjust inputs on other programs such as DOE-22 to  
reduce insulation thicknesses etc.  Not sure what version Therm is up  
to but it is industry recognised for this type of analysis and allows  
a range of boundary conditions to be defined (heat flux, convection,  
long wave radiation etc).

Graham

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702201708.AA0834343pd80001372750@gard.com>

We are asked to estimate the energy use of building design at detail
design stage by using DOE2 energy modelling. I am trying to modify the
actual performance curve for chiller pump, boiler, cooling tower etc in
DEO2, because we are concerned about the actual performance is different
from the default performance curve. We hope to specify the performance
curve for each individual project.   
I defined the mechanical efficiency of pump is 0.75, motor efficiency is
hi-eff. I assume that the program can calculate the pump flow based on
the load, use PUMP-HEAD-FFLOW to calcualte the head, and then work out
pump power with PUMP-HP-FFLOW, using Pump default motor efficiencies
chart to figure out the ele energy use.  
My problem is that I cannot see the relationship between the actual pump
curve (from pump specification) and the default performance curve in
DOE2. Does anyone input actual performance curve for chiller, pump,
boiler or cooling tower in DOE2 before? 
I would be grateful for any comments. Thank you in advance.   
 
Regards,
Vickie

Don't forget that  power companies also sometimes give large incentives.
In California LADWP's Solar Incentive Program is giving $.14-$.16 per
kWh estimated for 20 years of the panel's predicted output.  This can
really add up in a sunny location.  This program goes until 2011.
http://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/cms/ladwp000787.jsp
 
They give an example of how to easily do this payback calculation in
PVWatts:

John;
 
Yes - and no.  He is right that PV is no longer subsidized via the SGIP.
As of January 1, 2007, PV is handled through the California Solar
Initiative.  The program is a $3.3 billion dollar program that is
scheduled to operate for 10 years.  SGIP will continue to handle recips,
turbines, wind turbines, and a really cool thing called fuel cells for
the remainder of the year.  After Jan. 1, 2008, only wind turbines and
fuel cells will be eligible for SGIP for the remaining 4 years of its
program life.  
Ultimately, the statement, "California no longer gives incentives for
PV" is wholly inaccurate.  In fact, the Calif Solar Initiative - or
"CSI" is the world's leading PV incentive program.  In fact, California
gives too damn much to solar and not enough to other, better forms of
distributed generation (like fuel cells).  So there.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702191923.AA2302250pd80001372103@gard.com>

I am modeling a proposed building with rectangular concrete pillars that
thermally bridge the building shell with neither interior nor exterior
insulation. The exterior portion of the pillars extend about 1.5' beyond
the building's skin and are 1.5' wide. There are enough of them that
they shouldn't be ignored, but I haven't found any good references on
how to model them. I am assuming either an adjustment to the exposed

in order. I don't want to make this into a research project, so I'm
wondering if there are any good rules of thumb out there. Anyone?

That's a little low. 

Try $7 - $10 w/o batteries and $10 to $15 w/batteries.

Ramana,
 
a rule of thumb would be $6-$10 per installed watt (includes wiring, inverters, etc, no batteries, net capacity returned to grid).  To get payback you would need to compare the cost of electricity in the region.
 
say high to Joan, I think BINM just hired her from the GSA.

Dear all,

Any pointers to studies on how long it takes for photovoltaics to payback for the first cost (with or without balance of the system)?

I understand there are many variables involved and there are no straight answers, but any information regarding one or more than climatic region/building types will be helpful. 

Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702181126.AA2632187pd80001371510@gard.com>

How is the Zone-Fan-Ratio (ZFR) determined for Fan Powered Terminal Boxes?  In eQUEST the default for Series FPB is 1.0 and for Parallel it is 0.5.  The definition in the DOE2.2 manual is:
ZFR * Primary CFM = FPB Supply CFM
In the case of a UFAD system with Parallel FPBs the Primary Air Temp is 48F, the FPB Supply Air Temp = 65F and Recirculation Air Temp is 78F.  What is the ZFR?  An increase in ZFR should reduce the energy use?
How would you account for the energy savings using ECM motors.  One suggestion is to reduce the energy use of the fans in PIU boxes by 25%.  The default KW/CFM in eQUEST is 0.00033 kw/cfm.  Reduce this by 25%?

There are a number of papers on the LoanSTAR program available on our

There was also an EPA study on meas profiles for AHUs. Also, on-line. 

There is also the ASHRAE 1093 RP that had diversity factors from 40+

Dear all
 
I am looking for studies that contain data on actual measured building
energy consumption, broken down by use (e.g. pumps, cooling towers,
cooling system, chillers, etc).  Is anyone aware of any studies (any
location worldwide) that may have this data? It would be necessary for
the study to have the date the study was performed, the type of system
used (eg VAV or constant volume), location, and actual measured energy
consumption.
 
Thanks for the help,

Hi Folks,
 
I'm Vice-Chair of the LEED EA TAG.  Just to be clear - current LEED projects
are held to Appendix G as it was published plus any applicable CIRs.
Currently no addenda to 90.1 have been approved for use with LEED projects.

All,
 
I would like to just emphasize that the information was an offline
discussion. I should have emphasized that the addenda(s) do require official
approval from the USGBC, which has not yet happened. This will be something
to watch closely, until this is either approved or rejected by the USGBC.
 
My apologies for any confusion.

So, I just got off the phone with the EA TAG member, and here are the basic
items he passed on to me:
*	The EA TAG recommended to the LEED steering group to allow all
addenda, and there was no response stating the addenda should not be allowed

*	A recent CIR was submitted to allow all addenda for ALL ASHRAE
standards, and the response allowing these addenda is not yet on the USGBC
web page - and this could take weeks to months to actually be online
Additionally, the EA TAG member mentioned that there are other issues that
have not been put on the website, or took longer (than it should have) to
appear on the web page. Examples were the approval of Title-24 and the
Oregon Energy Code being equivalent to ASHRAE 90.1-2004.

One other note, the payback changes dramatically with the solar resource.
In Portland Oregon, we get about 1000 kWh/year for 1 kW capacity.

In CA, there has been a very detailed summary of costs prepared for the PUC.
The values in the table below are costs prior to any incentives and are
through some point in 2006. 

 

The payback is very sensitive to various tax incentives that  can vary by
state and by entity.  For example, the State of California/Utilities/PUC
have incentives that vary depending on whether or not an entity pays taxes
and therefore can benefit from tax deductions, increased depreciation, etc.
The "per kWh/per W" incentives are higher for entities that don't benefit
from the tax benefits.

 

We have seen paybacks ranging from something like 6-7 years on the low end
(including incentives) to approx. 11 years on the high end.  There is a
large amount of variability depending on size and complexity.  We typically
assume $8/Watt as a baseline cost for schematic purposes.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Humidity Control and System Types
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702161609.AA0951296pd80001370994@gard.com>

This is an eQUESTion.
As far as I know - the only system types (from the Documentation) that
allow humidity control are SZRH, PSZ and PVAVS.  ("MAX-HUMIDITY causes
the simulation to function differently for system types SZRH, PSZ and
PVAVS. For SZRH, if the MAX-HUMIDITY level is exceeded, the system
reverts to full reheat. The cooling coil leaving air temperature is
driven lower and reheat is added at the fan unit to satisfy the control
zone. For PSZ and PVAVS systems, specification of MAX-COND-RCVRY will
activate the use of condenser recovery to accomplish a similar result.
If a lower MAX-HUMIDITY is required to meet desired space conditions, a
lower MIN-SUPPLY-T should be entered. For SZRH, PSZ and PVAVS
MIN-SUPPLY-T should be entered"). 
Problem is - the building I am trying to simulate has chilled water
coils which only allows me to use SZRH, but it's a multizone systems
with VAV.
Are there any other systems that will allow me to do this (the variable
air volume and multizone options don't respond to an increase in
humidity control).
Thanks

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702161523.AA2321468pd80001370937@gard.com>

Randy:
 
As you experienced, different from other HVAC equipments, the ground loop heat exchanger (GLHE) can not be auto-sized by eQUEST. There are couple of reasons for this. 
 
First, the characteristics of GLHE is quite different from other HVAC equipment (i.e . chiller and boiler), which can be easily and properly sized using the peak loads. In fact, due to the huge thermal mass of the ground, the history of rejecting/absorbing heat to/from ground will significantly affect the performance of  a GLHE. Therefore, to properly size a GLHE, not only the peak loads but also the loading history have to be accounted for. As a result, eQUEST can not properly auto-size a GLHE before the annual simulation is performed. 
 
Second, there are lots of variations in the design of GLHE, such as borehole field configuration (geometry pattern), borehole depth, grouting material, borehole spacing, etc. These variations may significantly affect the required size of GLHE. Since GLHE is a relatively expensive device, it is really necessary for the designer to try various possible GLHE designs, perform simulations, evaluate the results, and finally achieve the optimal design. Although technically speaking, it is possible to make eQUEST be able to auto-size GLHE (which required multiple eQUEST runs controlled by certain iteration procedure), the auto-sized GLHE is by no means the optimal design.
 
There are also couple of notes regarding eQUEST GSHP simulation you may be interested in:
 
1. Warning messages will be given in the detailed simulation output file (XX.sim) if GSHP Water Loop temperature has exceeded a hi/low alarm. For example, following is the warning message shown in your output file. This warning message has to be taken care of since the heat pump unit will be shut down when the loop temperature exceeds the hi/low alarm. It is true in both the reality and the simulation. As a result, the room temperature could not be maintained at the thermostat set point. If this happen, you will see (in BEPS or SS-R report) high percentage of hours that the room temperature is outside of the throttling range. In this case, you need adjust the design of your GLHE incrementally until this message disappear. 
 
**WARNING**********************************************************************

WLHP loop: GSHP Water Loop has exceeded a hi/low

alarm limit and will shut down associated HVAC equipment

for the hour. Loop T: 110.26 Limit: 110.00

Verify that alarm limits are reasonable, verify primary

equipment sizing, especially ground-loop heat-exchangers,

and verify that the HP performance curves are suitable for

the intended operating range. See Report PS-D for total

number of hours alarm limits are exceeded.

First occurrence: 7/19/17

Actually, the better way to watch the performance of a GLHE is to let eQUEST output the hourly report of the GLHE outlet temperature, which is the entering fluid temperature to the heat pump if the thermal loss from the loop and the pump temperature rise can be ignored. As an example, to output the hourly loads on GLHE, outlet temperature of GLHE, and the undisturbed ground temperature, you can save following text as a short inp file and add it to your input file by using the "Import files" feature of eQUEST in the detailed mode. For advanced users, you can directly define the hourly report in the detailed mode of eQUEST.

$ ---------------------------------------------------------
$              Hourly Reporting
$ ---------------------------------------------------------

"GHX" = REPORT-BLOCK    
   VARIABLE-TYPE    = "GLHX (VertWell-CM)"
   VARIABLE-LIST    = ( 1, 4, 5 )
   ..
"Hourly Report" = HOURLY-REPORT   
   LIBRARY-ENTRY "Hourly Report"
   ..
"Hourly Report 3" = HOURLY-REPORT   
   REPORT-SCHEDULE  = "Hourly Report Schedule"
   REPORT-BLOCK     = ( "GHX" )
   ..

2. Mutli-year performance of GLHE has to be considered when you size GLHE, especially when large borehole field is used and the heat rejected to the ground can not be balanced by heat absorbed from the ground on an annual basis. In this case, although the GLHE loop temperature is within the limit at the first year, it may be outside of the limit just couple of years later. To observe the performance of a GLHE after multi-year operation, you can change the input "Years of previous operation" from the default 0 to other positive integers, and run the simulation again.

3. The "Number of identical borehole field" is only an approximate approach to describe and simulate large borehole fields. DOE-2 assumes that the identical well fields do not interact with each other. This assumption is only valid when the identical well fields are apart from each other with enough distance. For large vertical well field with many boreholes placed closely, it is recommended to use the exact borehole field configuration in the simulation. Data for simulating more borehole field configurations than the 41 existing configurations are available upon request.

4. New reports for GLHE will be added to eQUEST in near future. Hopefully, it will make the the iterative GLHE design procedure described above a little bit easier.

Hope it helps,

Xiaobing Liu

Thanks to all,

Brody and at least one other suggested using a larger GSHP ground loop.  That fixed it.  Thanks for your help.

Randal,
    I just ran into this issue myself, it looks like the temperature alarms on your GSHP Water loop are alarming and shutting off your equipment, then the loop returns to non alarm temps, then the equipment cycles back on, etc. 
It looks like you're alarming on both the high and low sides, so I'm guessing that whatever heat source or heat sink you have are too small. If you have a ground source heat exchanger make it bigger and see if that fixes it. 

Let me know if that's it.

Here in the Northeast a small net-metered PV project (<20kW) is going for $9-$10 a watt installed.  That cost includes the real-time web-reporting harware/software required by the local incentive programs.

Not necessarily..

If you consider $8-$10 installed (net metered)
If you factor in federal tax incentives (around 30%), it gets easier.

Furthermore, some states (like California) have state incentives. I saw a presentation at a conference in Florida where this guy in LA showed a 4-5 year payback after all the tax incentives and depreciation tax breaks.

Some utilities buy back net metered power at a premium - Georgia Power here in Atlanta is currently buying back at 17.4 c/kWh. he Hawaii Electric Company has some incentives for PV as well. 

40-60 years seems overly conservative.

I'd agree with Jeff.  At the other end of the equation
you might want to check out PVWatts, available for use
on the National Renewable Energy Lab web site. 
Without significant subsidies you'll discover that the
payback is very long indeed, with simple paybacks of
around 40 to 60 years.

There are a number of papers on the LoanSTAR program available on our web site. Several included WB elec, MCC, heat and cool, as well as L&R. 

There was also an EPA study on meas profiles for AHUs. Also, on-line. 

There is also the ASHRAE 1093 RP that had diversity factors from 40+ bldgs.

Dear all
 
I am looking for studies that contain data on actual measured building energy consumption, broken down by use (e.g. pumps, cooling towers, cooling system, chillers, etc).  Is anyone aware of any studies (any location worldwide) that may have this data?
It would be necessary for the study to have the date the study was performed, the type of system used (eg VAV or constant volume), location, and actual measured energy consumption.
 
Thanks for the help,

That's a little low. 

Try $7 - $10 w/o batteries and $10 to $15 w/batteries.

Ramana,
 
a rule of thumb would be $6-$10 per installed watt (includes wiring, inverters, etc, no batteries, net capacity returned to grid).  To get payback you would need to compare the cost of electricity in the region.
 
say high to Joan, I think BINM just hired her from the GSA.

Dear all,

Any pointers to studies on how long it takes for photovoltaics to payback for the first cost (with or without balance of the system)?

I understand there are many variables involved and there are no straight answers, but any information regarding one or more than climatic region/building types will be helpful.

All,
 
I would like to just emphasize that the information was an offline discussion. I should have emphasized that the addenda(s) do require official approval from the USGBC, which has not yet happened. This will be something to watch closely, until this is either approved or rejected by the USGBC.
 
My apologies for any confusion.

So, I just got off the phone with the EA TAG member, and here are the basic items he passed on to me:

*	The EA TAG recommended to the LEED steering group to allow all addenda, and there was no response stating the addenda should not be allowed 

*	A recent CIR was submitted to allow all addenda for ALL ASHRAE standards, and the response allowing these addenda is not yet on the USGBC web page - and this could take weeks to months to actually be online

Additionally, the EA TAG member mentioned that there are other issues that have not been put on the website, or took longer (than it should have) to appear on the web page. Examples were the approval of Title-24 and the Oregon Energy Code being equivalent to ASHRAE 90.1-2004.

Andrew,
 
Please refer to the following link to my blog for doing energy studies 
in the State of Washington:
 
http://elcca-exchange.blogspot.com/search/label/Checklists
 
In the topic "eQuest Detailed Editor Checklist" under the heading 
"Doors & Windows" there are some BDL expressions that may be of some use
to you.
 
They are for centering windows on walls, defining the windows to be a
fixed percentage 
of the parent wall, etc. but should provide a good starting point to 
do what you're asking.  See DOE2 documentation under "Expressions"...
 
 
Hope that Helps...
 
Brando

Subject: [bldg-sim] eQUEST window baseline


Hello,

I am creating an energy model for a LEED project.  In "baselining" the
building, one of the stipulations of ASHRAE 90.1 2004 is that the
windows must be evenly distributed in horizontal bands on each facet of
the facade.  My building has 17 facets due to a somewhat complicated
design and I am wondering if anyone knows a relatively straightforward
way to accomplish that distribution.  One of my problems is that in the
Design Development Wizard, there are only 4 areas in which to enter
percentages (N., E., S., W.) which doesn't seem to work on a building
with so many facets.  On the other hand, it seems tedious to go into
each window and adjust its percentage.  Is there a more elegant way to
adjust window proportions globally?  I am thinking a parametric run
might be the best solution.  Can anyone provide some insight on this?

Thank you!
Andrew McNamara

Andrew makes a good point.  Set either system or plant sizing factors to
1.15 & 1.25 respectively, but not both.

Andy:
 
For chiller and boilers, go into the Water Side Tab (I assume you are in
the Detailed Edit Mode by this time), click on either chiller of boiler,
go to the far right side to Capacity Ratio, and input 1.15 for chiller,
and 1.25 for boilers.
 
For TWO identically sized machines,  use the logic shown below from the
DOE2 help tab in eQuest.
 

CAPACITY-RATIO


The fraction of the design loop capacity that the chiller will be sized
to meet. This keyword is allowed only if CAPACITY is not specified. If
you are defining two chillers of identical size that exactly meet the
design loop load, set each chiller's CAPACITY-RATIO to 0.5. To include a
20% safety factor, set each chiller's CAPACITY-RATIO to 0.6. If neither
CAPACITY nor CAPACITY-RATIO is specified, the chiller capacity will
default to the loop capacity divided by the number of chillers attached
to the loop.

Hello,

As I mentioned previously, I am creating an energy model for a LEED
project.  In "baselining" the building, one of the stipulations of
ASHRAE 90.1 2004 is:
"G3.1.2.2 Equipment Capacities.  The equipment capacities for the
baseline building design shall be based on sizing runs for each
orientation and shall be oversized by 15% for cooling and 25% for
heating" 

I think that means I use "auto-size", but then how do I capture what
that size is and oversize it accordingly?  I am guessing that the
results may be in the SIM file.  Can anyone provide tips for executing
this?  Is there a better way to do that auto-sizing for each
orientation? 

Thanks,

Assuming you are using eQUEST, in the Detailed Edit mode, you can
specify the ratio of equipment sizing that you want for both heating and
cooling.  So to specify the Appendix G baseline model, you would
oversize cooling by a factor of 1.15 and heating by a factor of 1.25.
Take care to check what the system sizing ratio is set at as well so you
don't add safety factor upon safety factor.  Good luck.

Hi Andy,

Auto-sizing is a good way to go.  That makes the schedule inputs for CDD and
HDD very important.  Also, make sure the Zone Sizing option is "Adjust
loads" and the System Sizing Option is "Coincident".  When using the
Auto-size, set the System Heat Sizing Ratio to 1.25 and the System Cool
Sizing Ratio to 1.15.  Similarly for any central plant equipment, set the
capacity ratio to 1.15 for cooling equipment and 1.25 for heating equipment.

You can find out what the auto-sized capacities are in the SV-A output
reports for systems, and the  PV-A output reports for plant equipment.

So, I just got off the phone with the EA TAG member, and here are the basic items he passed on to me:

*	The EA TAG recommended to the LEED steering group to allow all addenda, and there was no response stating the addenda should not be allowed
*	A recent CIR was submitted to allow all addenda for ALL ASHRAE standards, and the response allowing these addenda is not yet on the USGBC web page - and this could take weeks to months to actually be online

Additionally, the EA TAG member mentioned that there are other issues that have not been put on the website, or took longer (than it should have) to appear on the web page. Examples were the approval of Title-24 and the Oregon Energy Code being equivalent to ASHRAE 90.1-2004.

Mitchell,
 
Is that official or unofficial news from USGBC?  As far as I understood LEED 2.2 is using the version of Appendix G as written in ASHRAE 90.1-2004 without addenda.  The change in Appendix G allowing you to use the actual window placement rather than equal banding on each facet was changed via ASHRAE addendum A in 2006 which means it would NOT apply to LEED 2.2 projects.
 
Here is the email response I got last month when I asked a member of the EA-TAG whether Addenda to 90.1-2004 applied to LEED 2.2. " Unfortunately it stops at 90.1-2004 and does not include addenda.  The Reference Guide explicitly states "90.1-2004 (without amendments)"."
 
Is there anyone from USGBC that can clarify this?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702151453.AA5337156pd80001369888@gard.com>

Hello,

As I mentioned previously, I am creating an energy model for a LEED
project.  In "baselining" the building, one of the stipulations of ASHRAE
90.1 2004 is:
"G3.1.2.2 Equipment Capacities.  The equipment capacities for the baseline
building design shall be based on sizing runs for each orientation and shall
be oversized by 15% for cooling and 25% for heating"

I think that means I use "auto-size", but then how do I capture what that
size is and oversize it accordingly?  I am guessing that the results may be
in the SIM file.  Can anyone provide tips for executing this?  Is there a
better way to do that auto-sizing for each orientation?

Thanks,
Andrew McNamara

	From what I have been told by a member of the EA TAG is that the
horizontal bands are no longer required. You can place the windows
as-designed and run the baseline with the same windows (as long as you
do not exceed 40% window-to-wall ratio).

Andrew,
You can adjust proportions of windows globally using the global
parameter functions in eQUEST. You have to write an expression for the
window height and width with respect to their parent entity (wall in
this case) that will look something like this
 
for height : #P("HEIGHT")*#PA("insert global parameter name here")
 
Note: the values within the quotes are case sensitive
 
You can now control the height globally by changing the global parameter
value.

Dear All, 

I am writing to ask for your kind assistance. 

I am a graduate student and I am desperately looking for simulation tools to perform some analysis related to energy performance variation due to material variation in building envelope of Buildings for my Ph.D. thesis.

I came across your email address while looking for information on the design decisions and influence on operational energy.  I require a tool which is simple and yet can predict reasonably well the impact of changing material compositions of parts of a building on its operational energy. So far, most of the tools i have examined are either too complex or the simple ones are only available online for modelling and are thus not suitable

I would be very grateful if you could suggest a software that is simple to use and also available for free, for student research purposes only, as a matter of priority. 

Many thanks in advance for your cooperation of any kind in this matter.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Again, thank you.

Sir:

Are you familiar with eQuest? This is a Windows based
extention of the US Department of Energy's DOE-2
program (used all over the world). It has several
features which I believe meet your criteria:

1) It is FREE for download from www.doe2.com web site.

2) It is an hourly analysis program (8,760 hr/year).

3) It can be operated in a simple Wizard (Schematic or
Detailed Design), or in a Detailed Edit mode (much
more difficult). 

4) Weather from all over the world can be used with
this program.

5) It has a large built in library of materials and
constructions for your enveope evaluation needs. Or
you can create your own envelope composition.

See if this program might be of benefit to you.

You can even select specific utilities (although I have found its better to check whether your local utility has special buy back rates)

Ramana,
 
a rule of thumb would be $6-$10 per installed watt (includes wiring, inverters, etc, no batteries, net capacity returned to grid).  To get payback you would need to compare the cost of electricity in the region.
 
say high to Joan, I think BINM just hired her from the GSA.

Dear all,

Any pointers to studies on how long it takes for photovoltaics to payback for the first cost (with or without balance of the system)?

I understand there are many variables involved and there are no straight answers, but any information regarding one or more than climatic region/building types will be helpful.

Dear all

I am looking for studies that contain data on actual measured building
energy consumption, broken down by use (e.g. pumps, cooling towers, cooling
system, chillers, etc).  Is anyone aware of any studies (any location
worldwide) that may have this data?
It would be necessary for the study to have the date the study was
performed, the type of system used (eg VAV or constant volume), location,
and actual measured energy consumption.

Thanks for the help,

Thanks to all,

Brody and at least one other suggested using a larger GSHP ground loop.  
That fixed it.  Thanks for your help.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Photovoltaics - cost payback
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702141622.AA2251968pd80001368794@gard.com>

Dear all,

Any pointers to studies on how long it takes for photovoltaics to payback
for the first cost (with or without balance of the system)?

I understand there are many variables involved and there are no straight
answers, but any information regarding one or more than climatic
region/building types will be helpful.

Thanks,

Chris,
EQuest still creates an INP which you can run in batch mode using the DOE22
executable - separately downloaded from doe2.com.

Another alternative is the WINDOE2 interface that comes with DOE22 that 
you can
load and run individual INP's.

I still use the DOE22 executable in batch mode and I also use WINDOE2 where I
just have a handful of runs and want to avoid the time needed to load a large
file into EQuest ...

Be aware that the three simulation engines may give slightly different results
so stick with one method for comparative results.  Also last year I 
experienced
some stability problems with batch mode simulations.  At the time Jeff Hirsch
indicated that the three methods have different levels of stability 
with EQuest
being the most robust followed by WINDOE2 and the DOE22 batch mode being the
most unstable.  I can't remember all the details and generally the batch mode
works great, just something to be mindful of ...

Command prompt as you probably know is under Start - Programs - Accessories.

Regards,
Graham

Could someone give an update on the capability of Equest vs. Energy Plus for
modeling DOAS in parallel with either recirculating terminal units or
radiant panels.  This is in response to the postings on this topic in
December 2004.  Thanks.

Hi all,
The SS-O results of a model in eQuest gives that ALL my conditioned spaces
are below 60 F whenever the fan is in operation, with the exception of
mechanical rooms which have a higher design temperature set-point.
Has anyone encountered a similar problem, or has an idea where I can find
the error?
I checked all my schedules and set-points and they seem to make sense.

I have defined the cooling capacity and outside air, as well as flow rates
for all units based on Trace outputs - could that be the cause?
Thank you all for your help,

Randal,
    I just ran into this issue myself, it looks like the temperature alarms
on your GSHP Water loop are alarming and shutting off your equipment, then
the loop returns to non alarm temps, then the equipment cycles back on, etc.
It looks like you're alarming on both the high and low sides, so I'm
guessing that whatever heat source or heat sink you have are too small. If
you have a ground source heat exchanger make it bigger and see if that fixes
it.

Let me know if that's it.

Hello:
 
The system is cycling on-off. This may be due to low thermal mass, and/or precalculated ASHRAE weighting factors. Try layering your surfaces, set your floor weight = 0 to turn on custom weighting factors.
 
In your run, the average daily energy use is o.k....it is just having trouble with the low thermal mass from the precalculated weighting factors and system setpoints. See the paper by Haberl et al, 1988 in the ASHRAE transactions, which showed the same spikes.

Jose:

DOE-2.2 itself is compatible with SI unit use. But there is no apparent eQuest .BDL module to "fly" it through eQuest.

I suggest you set up your run in English units in eQuest, then switching the units outside eQuest in the .INP file.

I suspect you can still read the output data through the D2Sim reader as SI units.

John,

You can create custom bi-quadratic curves for each chiller (baseline and
proposed) in your analysis if you want a true "apples-to-apples"
comparison.  This is easy to do using data from the chiller manufacturer
and Microsoft Excel functions.

The more important question, could a user create a really bad ARI-550
compliant chiller and then compare it to an optimized as-designed
chiller and over-estimate the potential savings or is ARI-550 written
well enough that there isn't enough difference between compliant
machines?

Hi all:

The infamous "one equation, four unknowns".  Namely, IPLV (or NPLV, if
you are of that persuasion).

Utility incentive Programs and LEED say to use an ASHRAE 90.1-2004 code
chiller with a COP of xx and an IPLV of xx. As I understand it, IPLV is
a curve created as a standardization to compare chiller part load
characteristics, one to another.  However, no analysis program that I
know of (certainly not of the DOE-2/eQuest flavor) can extract such a
curve from a single number.

I believe you are losing out if a new high efficiency chiller with a 4
mile long condenser (just kidding) happens to perform quite well at part
load. You will not get a fair comparision, only the default program
curves.

Is there some accepted ASHRAE magic that will take an IPLV number and
make the 75%, 50%, and 25% kW/ton numbers, so that a true "apples and
apples" comparison between a code chiller and a super chiller can be
made?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702091450.AA5037125pd80001366362@gard.com>

Hi all,

This list is a great help, thanks to everyone who contributes.

I am trying to model a building in equest/doe2 with Fan Coil units in each 
zone and a make up air system supplying minimum outdoor air.  My problem is 
that the fan power and cooling loads seem too high while the heating loads 
seem too low.  I'm not sure why but I suspect it has to do with the set up 
of the MUA units and the OA-FROM-SYSTEM command.  I have seen a few of the 
posts describing how to set up MUA using OA-FROM-SYSTEM, but it's still not 
clear to me.  Can anyone clarify?

Here is what I've done:

1.  Zones with Fan Coil systems have OA supplied by MUA units using 
OA-FROM-SYSTEM.
2.  Zone OA specified by OA/person and/or OA/ft^2
3.  A dummy space and zone was set up for the MUA units.
4.  MUA units have supply/return flow specified as designed.
5.  MUA units have min-oa-method as fraction of design flow = 1
6.  MUA units have oa-sizing by sum of zone oa (does this conflict with 
specifying design flows?)
7.  MUA units have neutral max and min supply temperatures

Here are some of my suspicions...

1.  I am letting doe2 size the fancoils - could that cause problems?
2.  Some zones have multiple fan coil units as designed, but I am assuming I 
can group those zones and let doe2 size one fan coil units to meet the 
loads.
3.  Do I need to specify total supply/return flows per zone instead of 
oa/person or oa/ft^2?
4.  Does the OA-FROM-SYSTEM command automatically return zone air through 
the MAU, or do I need to specify exhaust flow?  I am assuming supply=return 
automatically.
5.  One last thing, can I have multiple zones under a MAU or just the dummy 
zone?  e.g. if I want to control the MAU supply temperature using the a zone 
(corridors) rather than neutral temperatures...

Thanks for the help,

Mike,
Thanks for your post. I think the only issue with this
method and which Jason Glazer has correctly pointed
out, is that it does not address how the heat from the
space is actually removed. This method will only
determine the conducive environment assuming there are
appropriate windows and window placement.

The other issue which might go in hand with this
calculation(and to avoid complex simulations)is to
determine in steady state conditions, if the zone in
question overheats during the upper threshold hours.
If it doesn't, then all the other hours should be
fine.

Any thoughts?
Gerald

John,

I could be wrong, but this is my rough understanding of how IPLV is
calculated.

The kW/ton at the different load points are multiplied by an assumed
weighting factor % that may or may not represent the amount of time
spent operating at that load point.  The product of the kW/ton and
weighting factor are added up to get the IPLV.  The kW/ton has an
inherent assumption of condenser relief of a varying amount for air or
water-cooled machines for each % load reduction.  The reality of this is
also questionable if you are comparing performance in Houston and the
less humid Southwest.

I'm not aware of any software that spits out your chiller curves from a
single IPLV value.  If one existed, I would still be a bit skeptical
based on the potential slop that can go into the IPLV.  You might just
have to find a chiller that meets the COP and IPLV requirements and get
the mfg. local sales engineer to run you enough full and part-load data
at varying CHW and CW temperatures so that you can create the curve
coefficients yourself.

Good luck, old buddy.

Hi all:

The infamous "one equation, four unknowns".  Namely, IPLV (or NPLV, if
you are of that persuasion).

Utility incentive Programs and LEED say to use an ASHRAE 90.1-2004 code
chiller with a COP of xx and an IPLV of xx. As I understand it, IPLV is
a curve created as a standardization to compare chiller part load
characteristics, one to another.  However, no analysis program that I
know of (certainly not of the DOE-2/eQuest flavor) can extract such a
curve from a single number.

I believe you are losing out if a new high efficiency chiller with a 4
mile long condenser (just kidding) happens to perform quite well at part
load. You will not get a fair comparision, only the default program
curves.

Is there some accepted ASHRAE magic that will take an IPLV number and
make the 75%, 50%, and 25% kW/ton numbers, so that a true "apples and
apples" comparison between a code chiller and a super chiller can be
made?

load. You will not get a fair comparision, only the default program
curves.

Is there some accepted ASHRAE magic that will take an IPLV number and
make the 75%, 50%, and 25% kW/ton numbers, so that a true "apples and
apples" comparison between a code chiller and a super chiller can be
made?

With concern about the environment comfort, the above links are by 
Gail Brager that addresses ASHRE Standard 55 and the development of a 
new ASHRAE Adaptive Comfort Standard (ACS). I'm not sure if this has 
been published yet. The long and short of it may be that your 75F temp 
could be pushed up.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Modeling buildings with natural ventilation forAppendix G
In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200612211745.AA451762pd80002390281@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702071443.AA4353406pd80001365248@gard.com>

Following up with these discussions, I wonder if this
would this be an acceptable way to estimate natural
ventilation in Appendix-G,

1) I first determine the hourly values for dry bulb,
humidity ratio and wind speed of the location of my
project. 

2) Secondly, I assume certain environmental/comfort
criteria that would be conducive to naturally
ventilate. In my case I assumed a temperature range of
55 F to 75 F ;a humidity ratio range of 48 Grains to
85 Grains; and wind speed between 1 to 15 m/sec. Thus
bracketing a temperature range between 55 and 75 and
limiting relative humidity to 60%. For these ranges, I
can naturally ventilate and hence the HVAC equipment
can be shut down. Also since these conditions are
evaluated hourly, I assumed a time buffer where the
building occupants take a slightly longer response
time if the conditions drift from the comfort range.

3) I evaluate these conditions hourly and flaged (1 or
0) each and every hour when these conditions are met.

4) Finally, I then took an hourly output of fan energy
from DOE-2 hourly report and match them up with the
natural ventilation FLAG and then calculate the total
fan energy reduction when the HVAC system is shut off
when the NV conditions are met. These results can be
then averaged out annually. 

The fan power reductions in % can also be translated
in terms heating energy reductions during the winter
time but it was not significant for the location I was
simulating for. I found the greatest fan energy saving
to be during the shoulder periods of April, May and
October. In total, it was about a 9% total HVAC (fans,
pumps and heating and cooling) energy reductions and a
14% fan energy reduction which was not a huge amount
when it came to total energy reductions and factoring 
all end use components.

Let me know if anyone has any thoughts or comments and
critically if this is an acceptable way to estimate NV
savings in Appendix-G.

Thanks.
Gerald

Try contacting Carnegie-Melon University's College of Architecture.
Their graduate studies program has installed a working solar chiller
system (using Broad as the absorption unit).  They used TRANSYS to model
the system.  Perhaps they have a graduate student who can help you out.

Ask the suppliers.  If they can't back it up then do you really want to
use their products?  In Australia we have come across two suppliers
Energy Conservation Systems (ECS) who can provide a tracking parabolic
collctor system linked to BROAD absorption chillers and Conergy who at
the time had a high effciiency flat plate collector system.  The
collection potential will vary significantly depending on collector
type.

After digging into EPACT 2005 last night I came up with another question
regarding the reference building's HVAC system. Here's the IRS excerpt from
"SECTION 3. Method of Computation".

3.03 Reference Building. For purposes of this notice, the Reference Building
is a building that is located in the same climate zone as the taxpayer's
building and is otherwise comparable to the taxpayer's building except that
its interior lighting systems, heating, cooling, ventilation, and hot water
systems, and building envelope meet the minimum requirements of Standard
90.1-2001. The energy performance of the Reference Building shall be
determined by following the methods for baseline building performance in the
PRM in Appendix G of Standard 90.1-2004. In calculating baseline building
performance, the Reference Building shall use the following additional
requirements from the 2005 California Title 24 Nonresidential Alternative
Calculation Method (ACM) Approval Manual:

For the full document go to:
http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-06-52.pdf

My interpretation is that the Reference Building (which is called "baseline
building" in App. G) would have the same HVAC system as the Proposed
Building with the exception that its efficiencies would be minimally
compliant with ASHRAE 90.1-2001. That is the HVAC of the Reference Bldg
would not be selected per Table G3.1.1A in ASHRAE 90.1-2004 App G. PRM is
only listed as a means of determining "energy performance" and not system
type.

Anyone else come to this conclusion or does anyone have clarification from
the Treasury Dept?

Cheers,
Jamy

  A few things I've noticed in the IRS notice (
http://www.irs.gov/irb/2006-26_IRB/ar11.html ) ...



  Section 3 - Method of Computation notes that "The energy performance of
the Reference Building shall be determined by following the methods for
baseline building performance in the PRM in Appendix G of Standard
 90.1-2004"  (not 2001).  However, the Reference Building should meet the
minimum requirements of Standard 90.1-2001 plus some requirements of Title
24.  In part 2 of section 3, the IRS goes on to say that the 50% savings
should be calculated using only the Interior Lighting, Heating, Cooling,
Ventilation, and Hot Water components of the models.  There is no mention of
process loads which, according to 90.1-2004 App. G, should be included in
the savings calculation.  It appears that the calculation and model should
be based on a hybrid of 90.1-2001, 2004, Title 24, and some IRS-specific
requirements.



  Has anyone else come to the same conclusion based on what information we
have on this deduction?



  Also, it would be great to hear of any experiences with the deduction.

  Justin,



  I don't believe the guideline has been issued.  It appears to be the last
missing piece of information necessary to complete an actual certification
letter under the interim guidelines issued Nov06.  From what I can piece
together, because of this, you can do the energy analysis but you can't
actually apply for the tax deduction without a certification letter, which
requires among other things a building inspection conforming to the missing
guidelines.  Does anyone know of a successfully completed project?



  NEMA has protested this requirement to the US Treasury Department last
summer - see below.



  Lee

  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  In a letter to the U.S. Treasury Department commenting on the IRS
guidelines, NEMA has taken the position: "The requirement of the Notice that
this field inspection be performed in accordance with NREL procedures is
unnecessary and inappropriate for the interim rule, which is independent of
energy-saving targets. Qualified individuals already exist that can inspect
an installation to assure that a lighting design that is consistent with the
prescriptive requirements of the interim rule has been installed in the
building. There is no need for new NREL requirements."

  As of August 21, Treasury has not responded to these comments in an
actionable manner.

We here at Glumac agree with your conclusion of the hybrid model.
Additionally, we have found an issue in resolving topics that are
accepted as exceptional calculations for LEED (such residential lighting
power reductions). However, we are still a few months from submitting
for these incentives.

We here at Glumac agree with your conclusion of the hybrid model.
Additionally, we have found an issue in resolving topics that are
accepted as exceptional calculations for LEED (such residential lighting
power reductions). However, we are still a few months from submitting
for these incentives.

	A few things I've noticed in the IRS notice (

	Section 3 - Method of Computation notes that "The energy
performance of the Reference Building shall be determined by following
the methods for baseline building performance in the PRM in Appendix G
of Standard 90.1-2004"  (not 2001).  However, the Reference Building
should meet the minimum requirements of Standard 90.1-2001 plus some
requirements of Title 24.  In part 2 of section 3, the IRS goes on to
say that the 50% savings should be calculated using only the Interior
Lighting, Heating, Cooling, Ventilation, and Hot Water components of the
models.  There is no mention of process loads which, according to
90.1-2004 App. G, should be included in the savings calculation.  It
appears that the calculation and model should be based on a hybrid of
90.1-2001, 2004, Title 24, and some IRS-specific requirements.

	Justin,

	 

	I don't believe the guideline has been issued.  It appears to be
the last missing piece of information necessary to complete an actual
certification letter under the interim guidelines issued Nov06.  From
what I can piece together, because of this, you can do the energy
analysis but you can't actually apply for the tax deduction without a
certification letter, which requires among other things a building
inspection conforming to the missing guidelines.  Does anyone know of a
successfully completed project?

	 

	NEMA has protested this requirement to the US Treasury
Department last summer - see below.

	 

	Lee

	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	In a letter to the U.S. Treasury Department commenting on the
IRS guidelines, NEMA has taken the position: "The requirement of the
Notice that this field inspection be performed in accordance with NREL
procedures is unnecessary and inappropriate for the interim rule, which
is independent of energy-saving targets. Qualified individuals already
exist that can inspect an installation to assure that a lighting design
that is consistent with the prescriptive requirements of the interim
rule has been installed in the building. There is no need for new NREL
requirements."

	As of August 21, Treasury has not responded to these comments in
an actionable manner.

Matt,

 

I read it the same way you did.  The methodology to create the baseline
comes from ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G (system selection, ect.), but the
lighting levels, equipment efficiencies, ect. come from ASRHAE  90.1-2001.
I also want to forward on a response from NREL that the "Energy Savings
Modeling and Inspection Guidelines for Commercial Building Federal Tax
Deductions" should be out it March.

 

Thanks to everyone for all the responses.

I don't believe the guideline has been issued.  It appears to be the last missing piece of information necessary to complete an actual certification letter under the interim guidelines issued Nov06.  From what I can piece together, because of this, you can do the energy analysis but you can't actually apply for the tax deduction without a certification letter, which requires among other things a building inspection conforming to the missing guidelines.  Does anyone know of a successfully completed project?
 
NEMA has protested this requirement to the US Treasury Department last summer - see below.
 
Lee

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In a letter to the U.S. Treasury Department commenting on the IRS guidelines, NEMA has taken the position: "The requirement of the Notice that this field inspection be performed in accordance with NREL procedures is unnecessary and inappropriate for the interim rule, which is independent of energy-saving targets. Qualified individuals already exist that can inspect an installation to assure that a lighting design that is consistent with the prescriptive requirements of the interim rule has been installed in the building. There is no need for new NREL requirements."
As of August 21, Treasury has not responded to these comments in an actionable manner.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702050901.AA0141312pd80001363540@gard.com>

Hello All,

A project is considering solar absorption chillers system for its cooling
and heating sources.

QUESTION:

For simulating solar absorption chiller in eQUEST, it was recommended to
model it with gas absorption chillers and track the hours that it is heating
during the day. Solar contribution must be calculated by "hand" as it cannot
be done in DOE-2. Subsequently, savings from solar is estimating by taking
into account local weather conditions.

Can someone elaborate the detail method of this calculation by hand?

Any information you can share is greatly appreciated.

 

Sincerely

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702022158.AA5841656pd80001363024@gard.com>

Glenn. 

That's a good question.

 Normally, when one uses DOE-2 one shuts off the infiltration in LOADS when the AHU is running (assuming there is some CFM//FT2 fresh air specified in SYSTEMS). This is what is used in the SAMP1.INP file that comes with DOE-2. I believe the prevaling wisdom was that this would serve as a proxy for the pressurization of the building, although DOE-2 always balances the intake vs exhaust. 

In a city like Chicago, which SAMP1 assumes, one sees the infiltration "on" in the winter and "off" in the summer, which seems strange, but is probably not a bad assumption for a building heated with baseboards and cooled with a package AC that is shut off in the winter, with ventilation supplied only by infiltration. 

In reality, most olderr buildings have the AHU running 24-7-365, but then, this would say that infiltration was "off" all year, which is probably not what happens in reality. Most likely buildings that are positively pressurized also experience infiltration, driven by combined stack and wind forces. Such a coupled model is more complex than what is happening in DOE-2 and probably most other programs short of CFD or coupled nodal programs.

Jeff,

I agree with you, especially for residential applications that typically
do not use outside air intake to the AHU.

I'm not certain, however, how various amounts of forced ventilation
affect infiltration (except to reduce it, of course) for commercial
applications.  Have you seen any studies on this?

Thanks,
Glenn

It also helps to use the "S-G" infiltration method (which stands for
Sherman-Grimsrud). This seems to yield good results for wind driven
infiltration when tested against field data.

Aaron,

 

It is a fact that infiltration or outside air can dominate the heating
loads in buildings with significant internal heat gains, high mass,
insulated shells and/or good or few windows.  It is always a high
contributor per CFM in cold weather, and IAQ concerns can mandate
significant quantities of ventilation air.  Also, bear in mind that
infiltration is always proportional to wind speed, but it can be reduced
significantly when the building is pressurized with outside air drawn in
through air handlers.

 

If you really need to estimate heat losses due to infiltration, you
should apply a method that accounts for the wind speed.  A problem that
you might encounter, however, is the somewhat random nature of this
variable in the TMY and TMY2 files.  I have found that very high wind
speeds can occur during times of relatively mild temperatures, and can
set the peak heating loads.  These wind speeds are relatively random
compared to the dry bulb temperatures in these files because they were
assigned a much lower weight in the statistical selection of the TMY
monthly data.  You can check the wind speed whenever the peak heating
load is occurring at a strange time, and just disregard this peak, or
you can alter the wind speeds in the TMY file you are using.

 

Temperature data in the TMY files are fairly well behaved because they
typically vary much slower than wind speed.  In a truly average season,
the heating loads will be strongly correlated to temperature, but when
you introduce high wind speeds with significant infiltration effects
into a model, a few high hourly wind speeds can dominate your heating
loads.  This is counter-intuitive, and should not be occurring during an
average weather season (although it can truly occur in any single
weather season).  More often than not, we intend to model typical (or
even average) conditions in a building energy and demand simulation.  If
you do not somehow adjust (chop the extremes, average over time, etc.)
the hourly wind speeds in the "typical" weather file, you can obtain
strange hourly heating results due to infiltration.  My personal
preference is to estimate average wind speeds and average peak speeds,
and alter the TMY file to reflect these averages throughout the typical
year.  This way, the average seasonal energy effects of infiltration are
not altered, and the peak wind speeds are kept in place hourly but
buffered (to reflect more typical values).  You can do this or something
similar using the DOE2 weather utilities and a spreadsheet.

 

This might be more than you asked for, but I hope it will help you or
some other modelers on this list to answer some questions you may still
have regarding the effects of infiltration.

I have noticed that infiltration makes up most of the winter heating
load for several high-bay single-story commercial buildings I'm
modeling. (big-box retailer, light manufacturing facility)

 

I've used a variety of methods - ACH estimates, CFM / so of facade (per
ASHRAE F27.10), and Area(crack) x Velocity(winter wind) - to estimate
infiltration.

 

Have other people stuck with these methods? Or does anyone know of
better ways to estimate infiltration?

John, try making the demand interval shorter on the rate form, that
should sync them up somewhat.
 
Or if the utility demand interval is longer then it's appropriate to
have differing values.

Here's one way that will work using steam meters. Set up equipment in
the Wizard using a typical water cooled chiller and natural gas boilers.
Then switch to "Detailed Data Edit" under the "Mode" menu. 
 
1. Go to the Water-Side HVAC button that shows the water loop diagrams.
In the left panel Component Tree, right-click on the project title at
the top and select "Create Steam Meter..." Name your meter and create
from scratch. Attach it to your DHW loop. Edit as needed. Next, select
the DHW boiler and right click it in the Component Tree, select "Delete"
and erase the boiler from the DHW loop. Do the same process for your
building hot water loop.
 
2. Create an absorption chiller hot water loop by right-clicking on the
project name at the top of the Component Tree. Name the loop, create
from scratch and set loop type to hot water. Set your HW temp to 230F or
whatever is appropriate for your steam pressure going to the chiller
(steam is not explicitly modeled in eQUEST). Assign a new steam meter to
that loop like in item 1 above.
 
3. Create a new steam meter for the building hot water loop.
 
4. Double-click on your chiller and change it to an absorption chiller
(1 or 2 stage) and assign it to your chilled water, condenser and
absorption hw loops.
 
5. Next, click the Utility & Economics button and create a new Utility
Rate. Name it, create from scratch and set the type to Steam. Assign
your three new steam meters to the rate under "Steam Meters Served" in
the General tab. Assign a Uniform Energy Charge if appropriate under the
Energy/Demand tab. You'll have to calc what the effective $/unit is
based on the condensate billing. Remember this is calculated based on
steam, not condensate, so you'll have to factor in losses.
 
The PS-B report is a good summary of each electric and steam meter.
Total steam use will be summarized in the PS-E report for all steam
meters added together and PS-F shows each meter separately.

Subject: [bldg-sim] steam meters in eQuest



Hello - I'm relatively new to eQuest (though have used other modeling
software extensively) and I'm modeling a building on a campus with a
central steam plant.  The building is billed for steam use based on
gallons of condensate returned.  The building has steam-hot water heat
exchangers for the MZ air handling units and the DHW system.  It also
has an absorption chiller on the steam loop.  There is no natural gas
use in the building.  I set up steam meters in the loops for these "end
uses" but I'm running into problems.  I searched the archives and found
a couple questions posted in past years about steam meters but didn't
really find the answers I need.

 

1) I can't directly model the DHW w/steam so apparently I have to model
it as natural gas?  Or can I model it as a direct load in the steam
meter properties - direct load screen?

 

2) No steam use is showing up when I run the simulation.  I went into
the Master Meter screen and it only allows (apparently) electric and
fuel meters.  Under fuel meters, there is not a steam option, unless one
is supposed to select "other".  Does the Master meter need to know about
the steam meters?  And if so, how do I tell it?  Is there something else
entirely that I should be doing that I'm missing?  (Since eQuest's help
screen is a DOE2 help screen, I'm not having much luck with
understanding how it applies to eQuest in this case.)

Subject: [bldg-sim] how much cold air infiltration can I really expect?

Jeff,

I agree with you, especially for residential applications that typically
do not use outside air intake to the AHU.

I'm not certain, however, how various amounts of forced ventilation
affect infiltration (except to reduce it, of course) for commercial
applications.  Have you seen any studies on this?

Thanks,
Glenn

It also helps to use the "S-G" infiltration method (which stands for
Sherman-Grimsrud). This seems to yield good results for wind driven
infiltration when tested against field data.

Aaron,

 

It is a fact that infiltration or outside air can dominate the heating
loads in buildings with significant internal heat gains, high mass,
insulated shells and/or good or few windows.  It is always a high
contributor per CFM in cold weather, and IAQ concerns can mandate
significant quantities of ventilation air.  Also, bear in mind that
infiltration is always proportional to wind speed, but it can be reduced
significantly when the building is pressurized with outside air drawn in
through air handlers.

 

If you really need to estimate heat losses due to infiltration, you
should apply a method that accounts for the wind speed.  A problem that
you might encounter, however, is the somewhat random nature of this
variable in the TMY and TMY2 files.  I have found that very high wind
speeds can occur during times of relatively mild temperatures, and can
set the peak heating loads.  These wind speeds are relatively random
compared to the dry bulb temperatures in these files because they were
assigned a much lower weight in the statistical selection of the TMY
monthly data.  You can check the wind speed whenever the peak heating
load is occurring at a strange time, and just disregard this peak, or
you can alter the wind speeds in the TMY file you are using.

 

Temperature data in the TMY files are fairly well behaved because they
typically vary much slower than wind speed.  In a truly average season,
the heating loads will be strongly correlated to temperature, but when
you introduce high wind speeds with significant infiltration effects
into a model, a few high hourly wind speeds can dominate your heating
loads.  This is counter-intuitive, and should not be occurring during an
average weather season (although it can truly occur in any single
weather season).  More often than not, we intend to model typical (or
even average) conditions in a building energy and demand simulation.  If
you do not somehow adjust (chop the extremes, average over time, etc.)
the hourly wind speeds in the "typical" weather file, you can obtain
strange hourly heating results due to infiltration.  My personal
preference is to estimate average wind speeds and average peak speeds,
and alter the TMY file to reflect these averages throughout the typical
year.  This way, the average seasonal energy effects of infiltration are
not altered, and the peak wind speeds are kept in place hourly but
buffered (to reflect more typical values).  You can do this or something
similar using the DOE2 weather utilities and a spreadsheet.

 

This might be more than you asked for, but I hope it will help you or
some other modelers on this list to answer some questions you may still
have regarding the effects of infiltration.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] how much infiltration - an alternative approach
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702020434.AA3456593pd80001362579@gard.com>

Where design questions are about risk and variability,
and perhaps within the context of designs which
also pose questions about natural ventilation and IAQ,
solving both the building and the air flow domains makes
sense.

An alternative approach to investigating the patterns of
air flows in a building, including infiltration, is to describe
the air flow paths within a building and in the facades within
an air flow network and then let the computational engine
figure out what happens under different climate/operational
scenarios. Several tools offer these facilities and have considerable
libraries of flow components and some have very efficient
flow solvers.

In dozens of projects (including early design stage exercises) this has
worked well to identify:
* infiltration risk e.g. what happens if a school warden
   forgets to fully close some windows over the weekend
* for cost implications e.g. tightening up cracks on the windward
   side of the building
* what combinations of wind speed and direction are
   an issue for different parts of a building
* questions about facade details which have very non-linear
   flow/pressure performance curves
* how often predicted flow is close to Mfg claims
* how in transition seasons wind drive flows can be used to
   improve IAQ or transition into a scheme for natural ventilation

And yes, it is possible to not quite define reality within a flow
network.  Some practitioners will use wind tunnel tests or CFD
runs to improve the data on wind pressure coefficients. Some will
have blower door tests to confirm initial guesses about crack
areas.

And yes there is still some art to the definition of
flow networks. And while bulk flows are a lower resolution
than CFD they allow one to look at a thousand timesteps
and perhaps understand the temporal nature of a design.

An hour or so of preparation and a few minutes of
computational time  can provide design teams with quire
a bit of information.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200702011403.AA0325171pd80001362073@gard.com>

Hello - I'm relatively new to eQuest (though have used other modeling
software extensively) and I'm modeling a building on a campus with a central
steam plant.  The building is billed for steam use based on gallons of
condensate returned.  The building has steam-hot water heat exchangers for
the MZ air handling units and the DHW system.  It also has an absorption
chiller on the steam loop.  There is no natural gas use in the building.  I
set up steam meters in the loops for these "end uses" but I'm running into
problems.  I searched the archives and found a couple questions posted in
past years about steam meters but didn't really find the answers I need.

 

1) I can't directly model the DHW w/steam so apparently I have to model it
as natural gas?  Or can I model it as a direct load in the steam meter
properties - direct load screen?

 

2) No steam use is showing up when I run the simulation.  I went into the
Master Meter screen and it only allows (apparently) electric and fuel
meters.  Under fuel meters, there is not a steam option, unless one is
supposed to select "other".  Does the Master meter need to know about the
steam meters?  And if so, how do I tell it?  Is there something else
entirely that I should be doing that I'm missing?  (Since eQuest's help
screen is a DOE2 help screen, I'm not having much luck with understanding
how it applies to eQuest in this case.)

E-News Alert 
 	
 Globe<http://www.ases.org/climatechange/images/globe.gif> ASES Releases
Landmark Report - Tackling Climate Change in the U.S.: Potential Carbon
Emissions Reductions from Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy by 2030


The result of more than a year of study, the report illustrates how
energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies can provide the
emissions reductions required to address global warming.

To develop the report, ASES recruited a volunteer team of top energy
experts. These experts produced a series of nine papers that examined
how energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies can reduce U.S.
carbon dioxide emissions-the main cause of global warming. 

ASES collected the nine papers together and added an overview of the
studies to create the report. It covers energy efficiency in buildings,
transportation, and industry, as well as six renewable energy
technologies: concentrating solar power, photovoltaics, wind power,
biomass, biofuels, and geothermal power. The results indicate that these
technologies can displace approximately 1.2 billion tons of carbon
emissions annually by the year 2030-the magnitude of reduction that
scientists believe is necessary to prevent the most dangerous
consequences of climate change. 

The report, edited by Chuck Kutscher, illustrates how energy efficiency
measures could keep U.S. carbon emissions roughly constant over the next
23 years as the economy grows, and how renewable energy technologies
could make deep cuts below today's emissions. Wind energy provides about
35% of the renewable energy contribution, while the rest is divided
about evenly among the other technologies. "Energy efficiency and
renewable energy technologies can begin to be deployed on a large scale
today to help save us from the worst consequences of global warming,"
said Kutscher. "With continued R&D to lower costs and a reasonable level
of policy support, they have the potential to meet most, if not all, of
the carbon reductions that will be required in the future."

The report is available as a free download at
www.ases.org/climatechange. High-quality graphics showing the various
emissions reductions and deployment locations are also available at that
site. 

You can help by letting your friends, colleagues, co-workers, state and
local government officials and representatives, and your local newspaper
know about the report. A press release that you can forward is available
at www.ases.org/climatechange

All,

I'm looking for Costa Rica weather file, preferably in energy plus format
for climate analysis using climate consultant. It's not listed on the
energy plus weather data website. Any pointers to alternate ways of doing
it?

Thanks,

Aaron, are these buildings in design phase, or are you modeling existing
buildings?
 
If existing, I'd suggest getting everything into the program as best you
can first, and then adjusting the infiltration parameters last until you
match whatever calibration data you have.
 
For buildings in the design phase it is difficult since the future
infiltration may depend upon many variables, including the quality of
the contractor and operations of the building which you can only
estimate at this phase.  While we understand the causes of infiltration
and the variables you mention that affect it, infiltration is still hard
to quantify based on values of factors that you don't know and whether
or not the weather data that you do have is representative concerning
wind variables.
 
One solution is to choose some moderate value.  Then you could vary that
value by +/-some percentage and see if the "answer" you are looking for
from the energy simulation changes depending on the values.
 
Hope this helps!
 
David

Aaron,

 

It is a fact that infiltration or outside air can dominate the heating
loads in buildings with significant internal heat gains, high mass,
insulated shells and/or good or few windows.  It is always a high
contributor per CFM in cold weather, and IAQ concerns can mandate
significant quantities of ventilation air.  Also, bear in mind that
infiltration is always proportional to wind speed, but it can be reduced
significantly when the building is pressurized with outside air drawn in
through air handlers.

 

If you really need to estimate heat losses due to infiltration, you
should apply a method that accounts for the wind speed.  A problem that
you might encounter, however, is the somewhat random nature of this
variable in the TMY and TMY2 files.  I have found that very high wind
speeds can occur during times of relatively mild temperatures, and can
set the peak heating loads.  These wind speeds are relatively random
compared to the dry bulb temperatures in these files because they were
assigned a much lower weight in the statistical selection of the TMY
monthly data.  You can check the wind speed whenever the peak heating
load is occurring at a strange time, and just disregard this peak, or
you can alter the wind speeds in the TMY file you are using.

 

Temperature data in the TMY files are fairly well behaved because they
typically vary much slower than wind speed.  In a truly average season,
the heating loads will be strongly correlated to temperature, but when
you introduce high wind speeds with significant infiltration effects
into a model, a few high hourly wind speeds can dominate your heating
loads.  This is counter-intuitive, and should not be occurring during an
average weather season (although it can truly occur in any single
weather season).  More often than not, we intend to model typical (or
even average) conditions in a building energy and demand simulation.  If
you do not somehow adjust (chop the extremes, average over time, etc.)
the hourly wind speeds in the "typical" weather file, you can obtain
strange hourly heating results due to infiltration.  My personal
preference is to estimate average wind speeds and average peak speeds,
and alter the TMY file to reflect these averages throughout the typical
year.  This way, the average seasonal energy effects of infiltration are
not altered, and the peak wind speeds are kept in place hourly but
buffered (to reflect more typical values).  You can do this or something
similar using the DOE2 weather utilities and a spreadsheet.

 

This might be more than you asked for, but I hope it will help you or
some other modelers on this list to answer some questions you may still
have regarding the effects of infiltration.
