Hi Javier,

 

I would arrive at the same conclusion based on a strict reading of 90.1.

 

I can't speak directly for USGBC or its reviewership, but I would expect a rational/logical individual who is permitted to review models in a rational/logical fashion to at least consider accepting an alternate, non-electric baseline system *if* you can make a strong case for why a specific non-electric baseline would make for a fundamentally *better* system upon which to found a performance rating.  Perhaps circumstances specific to the region of Chile you're working in mean an equivalent electric heating source would be infeasible?  I don't personally believe 90.1 & LEED are at their core trying to make it inordinately easy *or* difficult for any specific region or circumstance, but rather trying to make the procedure as evenhanded as possible. 

 

Before taking any action (other than pursuing an "electric or other" baseline system), I would first suggest determining whether you can make such a case.  If so, take the actions necessary to pose your situation/query in a written fashion to the correct parties through the proper LEED channels - It's been said your LEED project administrator may have an email for directing project-specific questions to the appropriate parties outside of a formal CIR.

Hi Everyone,

 

We are working on LEED certification for a school project in the south of Chile. 

The building has a wood pellet based biomass Boiler to provide heating. Since the definition of the baseline system depends on the heating system of the proposed building, I am wondering how to clasified the wood pellet boiler.

The choices are:

1    fossil fuel, 

2    electric or Other

Should I consider wood pellet as " Other " and therefore the baseline system would be Electric?

 

Many Thanks,

Varkie,

I can't speak about the DOE-2.2  documentation, but as for the DOE-2.1E 
documentation, I know of two efforts to make them more searchable, which 
I assume is why you're interested in having them in MS-Word format:
1)  Back in 2000, there was an attempt by LBNL, I believe, to convert 
the text portion of the 2.1E documentation to MS-Word.  I  probably 
still have a copy of that somewhere in my files, but it would take some 
searching.
2) In the early 2000's, a colleague in China - ZHOU Hui - used Acrobat 
to make the 2.1E  PDF files searchable.
If anyone is interested in either of these, just send me an e-mail.

As for your last question, i.e.,  whether USDOE and LBNL still own the 
DOE2.2 Program besides JJH,  that's very unclear but I would have to say 
'no', since DOE decided to abandon/relinquish DOE-2.2 more than 10 years 
ago.

Varkie,
Jeff Haberl et al of Texas A&M ESL had scanned them into searchable pdfs (http://gundog.lbl.gov/dirsoft/d2getdoc.html) but the link is now broken.  I couldn't find them at the ESL website but maybe you have more patience. 
They are about 200 MB so I won't attach them here.

I will also point out that eQuest comes with a searchable .CHM help file that is basically a copy of the DOE-2.2 volumes. It should be in a directory where eQuest is installed under the "Help" directory. I prefer to use this to any PDF. It is much easier to navigate.

Thanks.  I was hoping for versions that can be edited, revised or redone and incorporated as examples in teaching materials about systems and plant.  Varkie

Thanks so much for pointing out that the DOE2.1e scans are 
searchable.  My 16 year old paper manuals are getting pretty dog eared.

No JJH and the state of California are the rightful developers of DOE2.2

Why r u looking for these do u plan to rewrite them?

>From what I've seen, Varkie may already have them re-written - he's
quite prolific  =).

 

Pasha and others: this query/discussion has developed some extra
traction/momentum over in the [bldg-sim] list, so you may want to
review/join the conversation there ;).  

 

A highlight: anyone with eQuest installed of late will find an
easily-searchable *.CHM in ...\My Documents\eQUEST 3-64 Data\Help
(compiled HTML, otherwise recognizable as 'help files' to Windows
users).  You can easily copy/paste images and text (separately) in my
experience, which is handy for discussions/queries here on the lists or
for any instructive purposes as Varkie is likely getting at.  

 

So far as ownership is concerned, I expect one or both of the two names
that show up with the copyright (LBNL and JJH) should be able to permit
reproduction/re-use of the contents, or else clarify whether this is
somehow inherently 'public domain.'  I would definitely pursue asking
for written permission first rather than after the fact, if publication
is in mind.

Because I'd hate for the spirit of my social studies teacher to haunt me over the weekend, here's presenting a revised model!

 

In response to the elevated heating load on/off the mailing list, the quantity of colonies represented by the number of stories has been revised to more accurately consider founding history I should have googled.  I hope you'll agree the accuracy of the simulation is not affected by the omitted star-shaped shading devices and this still captures the fundamental nature of the envelope performance.  Please expedite the LEED Platinum plaque shipping - I need a stylish serving tray for my brats this weekend.

 

Have a great weekend everyone!

It seems that other credits still document 15 stripes, which is inconsistent with the revised EAc1 model.

Please revise other credits to document thirteen stripes or alternatively revise and resubmit the EAC1 model and Template to show 15 stripes.

Your platinum plaque is pending clarification.

Hi All,

I was wondering if anyone has an idea on an issue that I've come across
regarding what is considered an exterior wall and whether the wall area
should be included in the window-wall ratio calculations. 

 

There are two existing buildings which have walls touching with no air
gap, but if one of the buildings were to be demolished the other will
not be affected i.e. structurally independent (although there is very
little possibility the building will be demolished). My question is
whether these walls are considered exterior or interior walls? My
understanding is that the energy model should simulate it as an
adiabatic wall but it should be considered an exterior wall for code
compliance and window-wall ratio calculations.

 



 

Any feedback is much appreciated. Thanks in advance.

 

Regards,

Mirza

Hi Mirza,

 

In my experience, "shared walls" are not counted as "exterior surface
area" for any WWR calculations or similar.  

 

In eQuest/DOE2 terminology:  "Interior walls" model heat transfer (or
lack thereof, in the case of an adiabatic wall) between two spaces.
They will not interact directly with exterior conditions.

 

Surfaces separating building spaces from outside ambient conditions are
"exterior" surfaces. 

 

There are no hard rules as to how you "should" model a shared wall, but
in eQuest you have at least a few options I think anyone would agree are
acceptable in most cases:

-          Assuming heat transfer between the associated conditioned
spaces is negligible, but assuming the thermal mass of said wall is
important for accuracy, model an adiabatic wall (default approach coming
out of the wizards in eQuest).

-          Assuming heat transfer between the associated conditioned
spaces is negligible, and the thermal lag caused by the mass is also
negligible for accuracy, simply delete any such walls and don't model
them at all.

-          Assuming heat transfer is important for the model's accuracy,
model a normal interior partition and also expand your model to include
the adjacent building space and its envelope, internals and systems.

If somebody demolishes half of your building in the indeterminate
future, I think we'd all agree that would probably warrant an update to
the model and you'd treat the surfaces newly exposed to the exterior as
such.

Thanks for the quick response Nick. 

 

Do you also have an opinion on the code issue, will it have to be
compared to exterior walls or interior walls if the walls aren't really
"shared" but are adjacent to each other with no exposure to the
environment? What if the adjacent building is demolished, shouldn't the
HVAC system be sized to meet that condition (or the wall built up to
exterior wall performance values)? I'm curious to understand how this is
approached in an MEP/code compliance standpoint.

 

Thanks again for the feedback.

I'm sure local standards and code application/enforcement varies widely
around the world, but in my general practice I do not design systems
anticipating other portions of the building completely going away...
FEMA/disaster shelters being a common exception =)...  

Unless demolition of the adjacent building is a definite and planned
venture in the near future, I would not deliberately oversize systems
for such reasons.  Oversized systems can introduce a host of ongoing
issues for the building owner/occupants involving comfort, budget and
operating efficiency, and for as long as the adjacent building is
standing such a system in operation is simply incorrectly sized for the
application.  

 

If demolition or destruction is a certain/likely possibility in the near
future, I might define and incorporate means by which an auxiliary MEP
systems (as appropriate) could be easily added if/when that occurs to
take on the additional loads for the affected zones.  I would
simultaneously advise treating the envelope's construction as though it
were exterior so far as its construction is concerned, though that is
more out of common-sense than any code/standard-driven requirement.

 

In any case, I would be surprised to find an energy code-compliance
official requiring abutting, structurally independent walls as you've
described them to be counted as exterior surface area.  Conversely I
would not as a designer include such areas in trying to "squeak by" for
lighting, WWR or similar calculations.

 

That's my opinion anyway, for what it's worth!  Best to leave any
specific code application/enforcement questions to your local AHJ as
they'll have the final say regardless of anyone's feelings here on the
lists.

Hi Mirza,

 

In my experience, "shared walls" are not counted as "exterior surface
area" for any WWR calculations or similar.  

 

In eQuest/DOE2 terminology:  "Interior walls" model heat transfer (or
lack thereof, in the case of an adiabatic wall) between two spaces.
They will not interact directly with exterior conditions.

 

Surfaces separating building spaces from outside ambient conditions are
"exterior" surfaces. 

 

There are no hard rules as to how you "should" model a shared wall, but
in eQuest you have at least a few options I think anyone would agree are
acceptable in most cases:

-          Assuming heat transfer between the associated conditioned
spaces is negligible, but assuming the thermal mass of said wall is
important for accuracy, model an adiabatic wall (default approach coming
out of the wizards in eQuest).

-          Assuming heat transfer between the associated conditioned
spaces is negligible, and the thermal lag caused by the mass is also
negligible for accuracy, simply delete any such walls and don't model
them at all.

-          Assuming heat transfer is important for the model's accuracy,
model a normal interior partition and also expand your model to include
the adjacent building space and its envelope, internals and systems.

 

If somebody demolishes half of your building in the indeterminate
future, I think we'd all agree that would probably warrant an update to
the model and you'd treat the surfaces newly exposed to the exterior as
such.

Subject: [Equest-users] Wall classification for adjacent buildings

 

Hi All,

I was wondering if anyone has an idea on an issue that I've come across
regarding what is considered an exterior wall and whether the wall area
should be included in the window-wall ratio calculations. 

 

There are two existing buildings which have walls touching with no air
gap, but if one of the buildings were to be demolished the other will
not be affected i.e. structurally independent (although there is very
little possibility the building will be demolished). My question is
whether these walls are considered exterior or interior walls? My
understanding is that the energy model should simulate it as an
adiabatic wall but it should be considered an exterior wall for code
compliance and window-wall ratio calculations.

 

 

 

Any feedback is much appreciated. Thanks in advance.

 

Regards,

Mirza

Debra,

 

My first reaction is that if you break out the demand charges from the utility rates you use for Connecticut you are going to reward any demand reduction with EAc1 energy cost savings, negating the need or justification for an ID point.

 

Regarding how to calculate peak demand savings - assuming you are doing an energy model for the building, and you are modeling the peak-reduction measures, the model will provide results for monthly peak demand reduction. I don?t think average hourly demand reduction and average monthly peak demand values are appropriate when looking at demand savings. It would be more appropriate to compare 12 monthly peak values for the baseline and 12 (lower) peak values for the proposed design that coincide with the same 15 minute period of the month as each of the 12 monthly peaks of the baseline. It could be tricky to determine exactly when these 15 minute periods should occur if you are not modeling the measures. A good guestimate for summer months would be to take the peak demand periods for each month provided by your model (without the demand-saving measures) and subtract the PV output and daylighting savings contributions at that time of day for full sunlight. I suggest reviewing the LEED guidelines for CHP to determine how to get credit for it, but that is also already covered and I doubt it falls into ID credit territory.

 

Regards,

Bill

			Hi Everyone,
			
			I am working on a LEED-NC v2.2 project which is small but has three technologies that reduce peak demand which is critical here in Connecticut.
			
			My question is how to calculate that % reduction in peak demand to go for an Innovation-In-Design credit for Peak Demand Reduction NOT demand response as seen in Pilot Credit 8.
			
			We feel that the Calculation should be as follows:

			Calculations:              

			Total average hourly electricity demand reduction  (TAHEDR) of building

			OVER

			Avg. Monthly peak demand of the building WITHOUT the MCHP, PV, or Daylighting 

			AND

			 the energy use reduction of the building from the energy model

			OVER

			the total energy use of the building WITHOUT the MCHP, PV, or Daylighting.

			The focus of this credit is to show how much energy is being offset by the sustainable power systems and how they are the reducing burden of the utility in terms of pollution reductions. (lbs/CO2, NOx, SOx, etc.).
			
			Anyone feel otherwise or agree? Please let me know.
			
			Thank you very much!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How much energy savings do you think has resulted from
 building energy standards and voluntary programs in the US building stock
 over the past 20 years ?
Message-ID: <4E68274A.9060801@whiteboxtechnologies.com>

Hi, everyone,

I've gotten involved in doing a short write-up for the United Nations Environmental 
Programme (UNEP) on the energy savings in the building sector due to the implementation of 
building energy standards over the past two decades.  My thesis is that although the 
theoretical energy efficiency of the building stock has improved significantly over this 
period, the actual measurable reductions in energy use intensity has been quite small, due 
to the following factors - increased amount of plug loads, and improvements in thermal 
comfort in lieu of real energy reductions (the so-called "take-back effect" mentioned by 
Mark Modera and others). The bottom line is that although one can say that energy use 
intensity in refrigerators have gone down by more than 50%, one cannot simply cannot say 
the same in either residential or commercial buildings.  At the most elementary level, has 
anyone documented the change in EUIs in residential and commercial buildings by vintage 
based on data bases such as RECS and CBECS for the entire US, or CEUS for California ?  On 
a more detailed level, does anyone know of studies that estimated the changes in space 
conditioning energy use between buildings built before the standards, i.e., 1970's 
vintage, and afterwards, i.e., within the last decade?

I'm throwing the net wide here, because I need to  get some ballpark numbers by this 
Friday.  Thanks.

I hope the good folks at GE realize that buildings don't use energy, people do.

But then, as Winston Churchill said, we shape our environment and our environment shapes us. Maybe Project Frog can influence user behavior to use less energy!

However, in my humble opinion Project Frog doesn't offer anything new what any architect or engineer who is sensitive to energy use in buildings doesn't offer.

Hi Joe,
We recently took up a initiative to analyze energy benefits of various retrofitting strategies in a 1970's vintage home in ten cities across four different climates in the US. We compared the home against IECC 2009 code. You can find details of our assumptions and analysis procedure here: http://www.carb-swa.com/ (under featured resources). You will find a download link to an excel file with the results on the same page.

Hope this helps!

Definitely. What we do for the most part isn't rocket science.

 

However, like you mentioned earlier, the marketing impact they will have could be HUGE.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How much energy savings do you think has resulted from
 building energy standards and voluntary programs in the US building stock
 over the past 20 years ?
Message-ID: <5D14BBF681EF264AABFD71DFB752B1620301809901@swactex2.swinter.local>

Hi Joe,
We recently took up a initiative to analyze energy benefits of various retrofitting strategies in a 1970's vintage home in ten cities across four different climates in the US. We compared the home against IECC 2009 code. You can find details of our assumptions and analysis procedure here: http://www.carb-swa.com/ (under featured resources). You will find a download link to an excel file with the results on the same page.

Hope this helps!

I think you are right here ? but with the viewpoint that Project Frog might
reach some owners that don?t have the funding/time to seek that advice from
their consultants or design team and now will have an ?off the shelf? option
as an alternative.



Most people on this list are probably part of a ?self-fulfilling prophecy?
where we work with people who need or want the advice.  In the world outside
those owners, I think this could be valuable.  I like it for society in
general, but don?t think it will affect me much personally.  Who knows,
maybe some of our clients will look at these?

I hope the good folks at GE realize that buildings don?t use energy, people
do.



But then, as Winston Churchill said, we shape our environment and our
environment shapes us. Maybe Project Frog can influence user behavior to use
less energy!



However, in my humble opinion Project Frog doesn?t offer anything new what
any architect or engineer who is sensitive to energy use in buildings
doesn?t offer.

Message-ID: <22CE8791E7DE554FB00676D7248C6B55555802BC@AKFMAILPA.AKF-ENG.COM>

Folks:

Anyone seen heat transfer analysis that can describe the performance of prefab wall panels?

The system under consideration is made from hollow steel shapes, 6" at perimeter and 2" at intermediate locations. The framing is similar to the attached.

The panel is sheathed in densglass and proposed to be insulated in one of two ways:

-          2" mineral wool in the 2" wide center void or

-          spray foam filling the 6" cavity around the framing.

The steel is not regular on 16" centers and represents a significant thermal bridge.
In our case the overall panel dimension is I believe 27 ft long by 3 ft high.

Any ideas?

Would this require a custom THERM analysis?

Hi Kirk!

 

I'm not aware of any importing procedures for Trace work, so if it were
me I'd probably just get started from scratch.  I think it might still
be worth asking the question on [eQuest-users] however - someone out
there may have developed something they'd share for the task.  If it's
any consolation, with a complete Trace file and your personal
familiarity, you probably have a good amount of information consolidated
into a single reference  - that will prove to be a timesaver, removing
much of the 'info-gathering' time/energy from one of your first projects
and letting you focus on learning something new.

 

Free training in the sense of structured training/classes is uncommon,
but you may find it here and there for specific topics rolled into
product presentations inquire and express interest with your equipment
reps - you may get lucky).

 

That said, at least a few of us can attest that eQuest can be picked up
without formal instruction or spending anything beyond your time, but
having a mentor handy to look over your shoulder and answer questions /
share tips / guide you on time-efficient workflow is definitely
preferable to learning alone - at least to start.  

 

Others pick up eQuest in for-cost formal classes or personal
instruction.  I can't offer any personal direct experience on the
receiving end in this regard, but you can seek and find references and
solicit offers for instruction from the eQuest-users community if you
wish to.  Perhaps someone is already local to you and available?  

 

Your comfort with Trace will definitely give you a leg up over other
starting at square zero - you'll identify similarities once you begin to
construct your first models and should have a good grounding on the
fundamentals. 

 

Best of luck - and welcome to the family!

 

~Nick

the information from the Trace file and import it into an EQuest file?
If not, is anyone aware of free EQuest training?

 

Thanks,

Kirk

Hi all,

I had a couple of questions I was hoping to get some help with:

1.  What is the difference between a "Facility" and a "Building" in
EnergyPlus?  I created a very simple building in EnergyPlus and am seeing a
large difference between the facility electricity usage and building
electricity usage.  I have not outdoor lighting.  What would be included in
facility usage that would not be included in building usage?

2.  I created the building referenced above with DesignBuilder, choosing an
LPG heating system with a COP of 0.8.  I wanted to do some further
manipulation in EnergyPlus so I exported the file as an IDF file.  In doing
so, it looks like the heating system was modeled as an Ideal Loads Air
System.    If I understand this Ideal Loads Air System correctly, the load
calculated in EnergyPlus is simply the amount of heating energy output
required for heating purposes, and does not utilize the COP I entered in
DesignBuilder -- is that correct?

3.  I can select the Ideal Loads Air Heating Energy as a variable to be
output in the *.csv file of all the variables, but cannot get it to appear
in the meter file.  After the run, "HVAC,Sum,Ideal Loads Air Heating Energy
[J]" shows up in the *.RDD file but not the *.MDD file.  Is there a way to
make this info show up in a meter file?

4.  Is there an easy way to set up a meter that would simply mimic a natural
gas or propane bill that simply shows therms or gallons?

Thanks,

Hi Kurt,

I can answer your question 2 on the CoP of 0.8 entered in DesignBuilder. When using "Simple" HVAC in DesignBuilder terminology, the EnergyPlus "Ideal loads" air system is used in the IDF data. The Heating CoP of 0.8 you entered in DesignBuilder is used to multiply up the loads calculated by EnergyPlus to meet the heating setpoint temperature. So the value of 0.8 doesn't appear in the IDF data but is used internally by DesignBuilder. 

The "Ideal loads" heating system heating loads are reported as "District heating" end use in the EnergyPlus output reports.

Regards,

Andy

Although I've never done it, you can export from Trace to gbXML which
could then be imported into eQUEST via Autodesk Green Building Studio.
Might be more work in clean up though then just creating the eQUEST
model from scratch.  There are good tutorials available for eQUEST via
http://www.doe2.com

Dear All,

I want to simulate a room with initial relative humidity as well as air velocity and indoor temperature. For the result, it is expected to have fine distribution of those three parameters. Does anyone know how to apply RH (relative humidity) parameter as one factor input in Star ccm+ as well as an output. It's seems impossible to make it direct definition of RH in star ccm+, isn't it? If it is, is there any alternative way/any others simulation software to solve my problem ?

Your suggestions or comments, Please ..

Message-ID: <DDC6CEED88CBED46868D11CF3A96EC82048F00AF44@VA3DIAXVS1C1.RED001.local>

Hello all,

I'm trying to change my schedules in EE4 to match the building use rather than the space use (eg. input schedule 'A' into a warehouse/storage zone.)

When I try to run the model, it crashes. I've tracked down the problem in my BDL file and can fix it there, but I was wondering if anyone knows where it came from or how to keep EE4 from doing it again.

The schedules defined in my BDL file include SCHED-2, which is lighting schedule A.  When I change an EE4 input to lighting schedule A, it references the non-existent SCHED-21474836 and throws an error.  The model runs fine using the default schedules, which includes office and lab spaces running on schedule A already.

I already restarted the program and the computer, and I get the same error starting from different "save-as's" of the same file.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Alex

Relative Humidity isn't a field function in Star CCM+ unfortunately, we have to create a function ourselves, this is actually pretty tough although they do have mole and mass fractions in the program already. If you send me an email I can give you the equations I use to put into a macro to create the field function, I would suggest asking your support person how to implement it. Also it needs some adjustment for temperature so be careful. 

I have put in a request that they include it in their field functions and hope that soon they will.

Just wanted to cross post something that showed up on the GBCI's RSS
feed this morning.  I did check - if you are working on a LEED project,
the "Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED Technical Manual" is now a link
under "Credit Resources" portion of EAp2.  This manual has been
referenced a number of times in the lists and is available to registered
projects free of charge.

 

Effective September 16, 2011, GBCI has increased the appeal fee for
specific energy credits to $800. Additional technical guidance and
training resources on these credits is available to registered project
teams free of charge*, including:

*	The Energy Modeling for LEED Technical Manual
*	A three-part webinar detailing strategies for successful
achievement of EA Credit 1 that will help professionals implement energy
load reduction strategies and capture higher point totals on new
construction projects 

 

The fee increase impacts the following credits exclusively. The fee
increase will help cover costs to review these complex credits. Appeal
fees for all other credits and CIRs will not change.

eSim 2012 - Call For Abstracts
Next year, design professionals, academic researchers and students will convene in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to discuss advances, challenges and applications in building performance simulation. On May 2 and 3, 2012, Dalhousie University will host the 7th biennial IBPSA-Canada conference at the historic Pier-21 Museum on the Halifax Waterfront.

     eSim 2012 will also coincide with the first annual meeting of the recently announced NSERC Smart Net-Zero Energy Buildings Strategic Research Network (SNEBRN).  The themes of the conference, as well as pre- and post-conference workshops, will relate closely to the network research priorities.

     We invite you to submit original research on the development and application of building performance simulation as it relates to building energy use, environmental impacts and occupant well-being. Only original papers related to the conference topics and not published elsewhere will be accepted. All accepted papers accompanied by a conference registration will be published in the conference proceedings and presented at the conference in oral sessions. In the event that submissions exceed the conference presentation quota, poster sessions will be held to accommodate additional papers. Each registration entitles the author to submit a single paper/poster. One additional paper/poster per registration is allowed with a special fee.

Conference Themes

*       Recent developments for modelling the physical processes relevant to building performance (thermal, air flow, moisture, lighting)

*       Methods and algorithms for modelling conventional and innovative building systems (including envelope, lighting, controls, HVAC, renewable energy and distributed generation systems)

Dear Colleagues:

We currently have a PhD Studentship Opportunity on the subject of 'Thermography for Thermal Building Assessment and Improvement'. The project will take place on the interface of transient building simulation, measurement (thermography), and building surveying. We have access to a high-spec FLIR thermographic camera. The work will be carried out in collaboration with industry partners in Cornwall. The funding opportunity is via the European Union - European Social Fund (EU-ESF), Combined Universities of Cornwall (CUC); this limits eligibility to UK or EU nationals. Further details on the project and how to apply are available on the web at:
http://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/ADG199/esf-cuc-phd-studentship-opportunity-with-environmental-building-group/

Message-ID: <28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B04E192AE156@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>

Hello all,

I'm writing to see if anyone has yet modeled a project using the default chilled water plant efficiencies  in Option 2 of the LEED District guidelines.  We have a project where the district plant efficiencies are not known, and therefore used the default efficiencies - given as 4.4 COP for the whole cooling plant (chiller, tower, pumps).  We have many other measures that we expect to push us above the 3 point floor (for v2.2).
Has anyone done this?  I'm trying to determine if we should just model the chiller with a 4.4 COP and the other equipment as not consuming energy, or break up this 4.4 somehow into the various pieces of equipment.  If breaking up, there isn't any guidance as to how to apply the efficiencies to each.

Thanks
Corinne

Dear all,

can anyone tell me how I can get a single monthly value (like through
'enquire about') for the gain of a modeled PV-installation on a specific
building surface.
The 'enquire about' option does not allow  the selection of 'renewables' and
thus I can only see the results either in bins, either on a graph ...

Could you re-phrase the question - what specific value is of interest?   A PV cell has a number of performance
attributes.  The electrical data will be held in a separate results file.

Message-ID: <005801cc7c71$996e8ed0$cc4bac70$%paquin@mra.qc.ca>

Hi all,

 

This question was probably asked before, but couldn?t find it in the
archives.

 

I need to create a custom weather for EE4 or eQUEST (bin format).  My
strategy is to use EPW format file and change the values to match our custom
data sheet.  I could then use the eQuest Weather Data Processing Utility
Program at :   <http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html>
http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html

 

However, I tried to run the program by changing the directory in
eQ_WthProc.INI.  Somehow, there is always an error message that states:
?6.8 is not a valid floating point value?.  Does anyone had this problem
before and how to resolve it?.

 

Otherwise, is there any other way to create a custom weather file to be used
in EE4 or eQUEST?

 

Regards,

Hi there!

 

eQ_WthProc is my weapon of choice.  I've found it possible to successfully convert EPW files without modifications... have you successfully converted an unmodified EPW before?  If so, that may help isolate whether your edits are or aren't a possible source.

 

I found a single reference to a "floating point" error - perhaps Susan's solution helps?:  http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/equest-users-onebuilding.org/2010-January/003052.html  Note her referenced screenshot is the .jpg link you can find at the bottom.

 

That .ini file / directory structure fix referenced is something I had to go through as well to use this tool at all, if you haven't already.  This tool is very handy, but maybe should be labeled "some assembly required" =).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Custom weather file in bin format

 

Hi all,

 

This question was probably asked before, but couldn't find it in the archives.

 

I need to create a custom weather for EE4 or eQUEST (bin format).  My strategy is to use EPW format file and change the values to match our custom data sheet.  I could then use the eQuest Weather Data Processing Utility Program at :  http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html <http://doe2.com/index_Wth.html> 

 

However, I tried to run the program by changing the directory in eQ_WthProc.INI.  Somehow, there is always an error message that states:  "6.8 is not a valid floating point value".  Does anyone had this problem before and how to resolve it?.

 

Otherwise, is there any other way to create a custom weather file to be used in EE4 or eQUEST?

 

Regards,

 

 

 

Marc-Antoine Paquin, ing.

Hi Michelle,
 
I've modelled many of these options for data centers in equest.
Conceptually, the simplest way to deal with it is to model the CRAC units
and servers process load as a separate zone within a larger conditioned
server room zone.  This gives you two separate systems to work with in the
server room, and you'll need an office space zone to receive the heat
recovery.  See the OA-FROM-SYSTEM keyword.   You'll need a spreadsheet to
work out schedules for the server load vs time and how much load the CRAC
units are seeing vs the server room main air supply unit.

Dear modelling community,

I've been trying to find a rationale to convert air tightness test results (held @ 50pa) to real life infiltration rates (@ standard conditions) for offices.

I came across an interesting publication, which provides a correlation mechanism for dwellings:
"A MODEL CORRELATING AIR TIGHTNESS AND AIR INFILTRATION IN HOUSES" , Blomsterberg <http://escholarship.org/uc/search?creator=Blomsterberg,%20Ake%20K.> et al

I was wondering if any of you are aware of a more relative to offices correlation?

Your advise is greatly appreciated

Chris,



If you are having trouble with the sunspace command in Equest, and you can't find a suitable explanation in the Equest manual. I'd suggest you to to the DOE-2 web site at LBNL and download the DOE-2.1 OCR manuals. The sunspace command was introduced in the DOE2.1d version, which is most likely what Equest is using. Hence, you'll find more of an explanation in the DOE-2.1 manuals. Most likely, you are the cause of the problems since it appears that you've pinched off the flow in the ventilation system that is causing it to crash. For starters, I'd suggest running it again and use as many of the defaults as possible, changing on those that you must change one at a time. I believe that one of the SAMP files that comes with DOE-2 has a sunspace example that you can look at for the defaults.



In addition, if you are trying to evaluate the heating contribution of a sunspace you can use several old packages. For example, the SLR method used to cover sunspaces, and althought the simulation is not widely available for this it is based on the PASOLE program that was written by Bob McFarland, which is a rather sophisticated code that used Russian nozzle coefficients for simulation of the trombe wall and other features. The SLR coefficients are still available in the GKSR book in the appendix. Copies of the old SLR manuals can be had from inter-library loan, or perhaps from NTIS (there were 3 volumes).



In addition, there is the SERIRES program, which is still available from NREL, now called SUNCODE, and there is FCHART. The SERIRES program was also a "strong" simulation program written by Palmiter and Wheeler at Ecotope. It remains one of the basis for the ASHRAE Standard 140 accuracy tests. SERIRES is a finite difference simulation program that is accurate but somewhat limited to specific cases of passive solar architecture.



FCHART will also simulate sunspaces using a direct gain passive solar using the un-utilizability method, which is explained in the Duffie-Beckman Solar Engineering textbook.



You might even consider using an ensemble of simulations to bound your answer to make sure what you are doing is reasonable.



Jeff

FYI,



You'll also need to consult the NFRC database, which includes the XXXX or four digit library designation for LBNL's WINDOW program that has the inputs for DOE-2, EQUEST and Energyplus as well as other programs. Simulation of the advanced glazing is non-trivial. Hence, you'll need to use a program that uses a predefined window definition file, as well as a description of the frame, placement (i.e., shading), and infiltration.

Leen,

Window panels are made of a combination of parameters. There are a lot of parameter (options) available on the market influencing the effiency of the window panel:

- Gas (argon/krypton/air);
- Type of glass (clear/low-e/bronze/silver etc.);
- Position and number of the low-e coatings (properties of low-e coating can vary depending of the degree of efficiency needed);
- Nb of panes;
- Thickness of glass pane;
- Width of gap;
- Etc.

I think, first of all you will have to make a selection of parameters for a complete window panel. It will be easier to find the properties after.

Dear modelling community, 

 

I've been trying to find a rationale to convert air tightness test results
(held @ 50pa) to real life infiltration rates (@ standard conditions) for
offices. 

 

I came across an interesting publication, which provides a correlation
mechanism for dwellings:

"A MODEL CORRELATING AIR TIGHTNESS AND AIR INFILTRATION IN HOUSES" ,
<http://escholarship.org/uc/search?creator=Blomsterberg,%20Ake%20K.>
Blomsterberg et al

 

I was wondering if any of you are aware of a more relative to offices
correlation?

 

Your advise is greatly appreciated

eSim 2012 - Call For Abstracts

Next year, design professionals, academic researchers and students will
convene in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to discuss advances, challenges and
applications in building performance simulation. On May 2 and 3, 2012,
Dalhousie University will host the 7th biennial IBPSA-Canada conference at
the historic Pier-21 Museum on the Halifax Waterfront. 

     eSim 2012 will also coincide with the first annual meeting of the
recently announced NSERC Smart Net-Zero Energy Buildings Strategic
Research Network (SNEBRN).  The themes of the conference, as well as pre-
and post-conference workshops, will relate closely to the network research
priorities. 

     We invite you to submit original research on the development and
application of building performance simulation as it relates to building
energy use, environmental impacts and occupant well-being. Only original
papers related to the conference topics and not published elsewhere will
be accepted. All accepted papers accompanied by a conference registration
will be published in the conference proceedings and presented at the
conference in oral sessions. In the event that submissions exceed the
conference presentation quota, poster sessions will be held to accommodate
additional papers. Each registration entitles the author to submit a
single paper/poster. One additional paper/poster per registration is
allowed with a special fee.

Conference Themes

.       Recent developments for modelling the physical processes relevant
to building performance (thermal, air flow, moisture, lighting)

.       Methods and algorithms for modelling conventional and innovative
building systems (including envelope, lighting, controls, HVAC, renewable
energy and distributed generation systems)

.       Methods for modelling and characterizing whole building
performance, including interactions between systems within the  building,
and interactions between the building and its surrounding neighbourhood
and community

.       Methods for modelling and characterizing occupant comfort and
wellbeing (including thermal comfort, acoustic performance, air-quality,
ventilation and lighting)  

.       Building simulation software development and quality control
approaches

.       Use of building simulation tools in building design, optimization,
code compliance and incentive programs

Message-ID: <1AF72AA22F6D1B4CBA603B402ED47F046FB5CC1672@AMXEXC02.global.arup.com>

All,

Can anyone provide some general watch-its, best practices, or commonly-used workarounds for EE4?  We are embarking on using EE4 for building energy modeling and are just getting to know the software.  It looks to me like there isn't any ability to create templates like there is in eQuest or Trace, to speed up building the model and modifying standard components. Has anyone found any work-arounds for entering, or modifying, repetitive data?

Thanks,

Hi Anne Marie,

Anything you create in EE4 (chiller, utility rate, HVAC system, wall 
type etc) goes to the project library (which is specific to that 
project).  When you start a new project, EE4 takes a copy of the default 
library and makes it the project library.  You can copy any element in 
any of the libraries to the default library so it will be there in the 
project library next time you create a project.  You can also open 
multiple files within EE4 and then you can copy any element from the 
library of one file to the other file.

Regarding work arounds & "gotchas", the EE4 modelling guide is a pretty 
good guideline on using the software with descriptions of the common 
workarounds.  (I can send as a .pdf if you do not have a copy.)  There 
is also an EE4 FAQ webpage with more recent "issues" documented ... it 
is here:
http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/commercial/newbuildings/faq/questions-answers.cfm?attr=20

Hope this helps.

There is an EE4 training session on Oct 18 & 19 ... but sadly, it is in 
Mississauga, ON.  There is EE4 training in Vancouver from time to time.  
I would suggest contacting Curt Hepting of EnerSys or Shaun Martin in 
Vancouver.  They are the closest experts to you I know.

Good luck!

Hi Jawan,
Sounds like the HVAC controls are still reacting to the temperature and RH
criteria as is usually the default. So, even though the people may be
comfortable as per the redefined criteria, the system's working in the same
old way - no difference in energy.
I'd suggest taking a look at the bio-climatic chart and raising the
temperature set-point accordingly.
Regards
Shubhra

Hi Jawan,

I think increasing the air velocity will surely show the effect on PMV/PDD,
but in energy-plus the air velocity is not not associated with the power of
equipment (it is only defined as a schedule with a particular value in m/s)
therefore it will not show any effect on the energy consumption.

Regards

Jawan,

Assuming you have the same air flow rates (but varying velocities), to change the energy consumption of the fan in EnergyPlus you will need to change the value of the Pressure Rise parameter in fan object (Fan:ConstantVolume or Fan:VariableVolume).  The increased velocity will change your pressure drop which will result in different energy consumption for varying velocities.

As you know, there is no direct link between the comfort velocity and the air system flow rate but this can be accomplished in EnergyPlus using EMS.  You would need to formulate your own model for the air velocity experienced by the occupants as a function of dynamic flow rate leaving the VAV air terminal unit.  This model would depend on the distribution and nature of the supply air terminals.  The general problem here is very complex and would probably require CFD to do accurately.  But a simple engineering model could be developed for a specific zone by scaling from the air terminal flow rate (m3/s) divided by an appropriate zone hydraulic diameter or cross section (m2).   This custom model would then be programmed in the EnergyPlus Runtime Language and included in the input file.  You would set up a Sensor for flow rate leaving the air terminal and an Actuator on the schedule used for the air velocity in the People object.  See the Application Guide for EMS.
