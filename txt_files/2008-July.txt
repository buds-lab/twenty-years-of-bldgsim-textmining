Foroutan,

I remember doing interstitial condensation some years ago and displaying plots 
of actual and dew point temperature through cross sections of the fabric. Did 
not have any ice in the model though. I used ESP-r.

thought would be that it should be considered a cooling system.

My thoughts on this would be that your main system should be sized to
provide the fresh air at your cooling temperature to replace the air
rejected by the exhaust, and you will probably find this is happening unless
your space is negatively pressurized.

I have a mechanical room that is conditioned to 95 in cooling through
exhaust fans and heated to 65 with unit heaters.

 

Do the exhaust fans constitute as a cooling system?  The system would need
to provide a sensible capacity of 5 btu/h*ft2 for the mech room to be
considered to be a cooled space, which I have not yet calculated.

 

The reason I as is that if these exhaust fans are not considered a cooling
system then the baseline cooling system will need to be modeled to complete
an accurate LEED model.

 

Any suggestions?

There definitely seems to be some variability out there on how it's handled.
There are?several LEED CIRs?posted on the LEED website for situations that seem similar to this.? My take on it is that if you are only ventilating the spaces, the ventilation fans don't need to be counted as a cooling system; thus, you do not need to model a cooling system for these spaces.? However, the fan energy does need to be accounted for in both the? proposed and baseline models.? So, they basically become energy neutral in the models and/or are treated kind of like a process energy load.
If others have a different interpretations, I'd appreciate?hearing the feedback.

I have asked about this before and I don't remember what the answer was.
Where does exhaust fan energy get inputted exactly?  I think the best answer
I got before was that exhaust fan energy gets included in the supply or
return fan energy.  Is this correct?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] VSD Centrifugal Chiller Performance EIR-f(PLR,
	dT) and EIR-f(t1, t2)
Message-ID: <001e01c8dba5$685e0ca0$2001a8c0@JOHN>

Hello Equest users,

 

I have a question regarding variable speed centrifugal chillers and
generating the EIR performance curves.

 

The DOE-2 help information regarding the EIR-f(PLR) curve explains that it
is equally important to include the "dT" term when considering variable
speed chillers due to the relationship between the impeller speed and the
suction/discharge pressure (or temperature) differential.  This affect can
be seen when comparing a VFD chiller with condenser water temperature reset
to a constant speed chiller with condenser water reset.  Without the
condenser water reset, there is little efficiency gain from the variable
speed compressor.

 

The second EIR performance curve is the EIR-f(T evap leaving, T cond
entering) or EIR-FT.  This curve adjusts the EIR based on the leaving
chilled water temperature and the entering condenser water temperature.

 

It seems that if the "dT" term is included in the EIR-f(PLR) curve, the
efficiency increase due to a reduced condenser water temperature is being
double counted since Equest calculates the chiller demand by multiplying the
design EIR by these two results together (plus the capacity curves).  Can
anyone provide some insight on this topic?  What is the difference between
the affects of the "dT" in the EIR-f(PLR) and the EIR-f(T evap leaving, T
cond entering) on the design EIR?

 

Thanks for your thoughts,

 

John

Message-ID: <1215066423.486c7137289d2@webmail.vt.edu>

Hi -
I modeled daylighting in perimeter zones, the settings are:
Zone depth: 30'
3 rows of lights: 5', 15' and 25' from window
Top of the window 10' from the floor
Strip window 40% of total wall area

Daylighting control: dimming to 10%, continous off
2 sensors, one located 7.5' from window, control the first row (33% lights)
the other one located 17.5' from window, control the second row (33% lights)
max glare 22

Other settings are all default.

The results shows that the lighting energy reduction for the perimeter zones is
about 50%. I feel this is a little bit high, which equals to the ist row off
all the time and the second row off 50% of the time.

Do you think the result is resonable?

By the way, only one window is modeled for each zone, so the window is very
long, but I didn't get warnings.

Thanks in advance!

Dear All,

 

This query is regarding Light pollution analysis for LEED Sustainable Sites
Cr 8. I have modeled exterior lighting arrangement of the building with
DIALuxR and have some doubts in the third requirement of exterior light
pollution i.e. light trespassing.

 

As per the reference guide, in order to measure the illumination at site
boundary and 15 ft beyond that, a calculation grid should be placed with
maximum spacing of 10'X10'.

 

My query is - For measuring vertical and horizontal illumination level at
boundary, does it mean to place illumination sensor spaced at max 10 ft
distance? And, should all of them be at human eye level?

 

Any input will be appreciated.

 

 

Thanks & Regards,

Prabhat Barnwal

about 50%. I feel this is a little bit high, which equals to the ist row off
all the time and the second row off 50% of the time.

Do you think the result is resonable?

By the way, only one window is modeled for each zone, so the window is very
long, but I didn't get warnings.

Thanks in advance!

Message-ID: <749236.31991.qm@web58104.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Hello,
?
I defined the miscelleneous equipment load as internal load in my eQUEST baseline model. I can find the energy consumption in kwh in the detail output file. However, where could I find the energy cost for the miscelleneous equipment load because I want to make sure it is at least 25% of the total energy cost in the baseline model? I really appreciate if anyone can give me some hints.
?
Thank
?

Are the .BIN weather data files used by eQUEST in the same format as the .BIN packed weather data file that were used by DOE2.1E? I have some actual annual weather data files for my site that I use to run my models against actual utility data for the same year to help calibrate them. My clients are requesting current work to performed using eQUEST rather than DOE2.1E, but I wanted to be able to do these same calibration checks. If they are not in the same format, is there a conversion utility available?

Thanks in advance for anyone's reply,

Just in case there was some confusion, the TMY3 (like TMY2) are not continuous periods of chronological time, they are 12 individual months often from different years that are combined to form one "average" or typical year for simulation purposes.

So the data are (mostly) actual hourly weather observations, but not for one continuous year that would correspond with the utility bills.

Does any one know whether or not eQuest BDL can be trascribed into 
Energy Pro software? I ask because I don't want to duplicate the efforts 
already exerted in eQuest to be able to model a VRF system in Energy Pro.

On that same note, is Energy Pro all that different than eQuest? (In

University of California, Berkeley

The objective of this workshop is to introduce DesignBuilder to the users
and simulators who would like to use EnergyPlus simulation tool to model
energy performance of buildings, but without the complexities of working
with arcane input file editor. DesignBuilder is the most comprehensive and
powerful graphical user interface for EnergyPlus. This hands-on training
will provide general overview and introduction to building energy analysis
using DesignBuilder. The trainees will learn to quickly setup a building
model, change the building parameters using components and templates and run
the simulation

Hey All,

I (painstakingly) entered a custom window layout in DD mode on a 4-floor multifamily mid-rise shell, but only the first floor in the shell displays my window layout whether I use the Floor Multiplier or not.  Does anyone know how I can duplicate my custom window layout for all of the floors in the shell? I assumed it would do this with the floor multiplier.  Thanks!

I believe in the wizard you have to do the windows for each level (ground,
mid and top).  But, once in the detailed mode, you can copy a wall component
and all child components (meaning windows and doors) and assign it to
another space.  Then delete the original wall component.

Hope this helps.

The LS-B Space Peak Load Components Report shows my peak cooling load
for a perimeter hotel room with windows occurring on Oct 2 at 5pm when
its 62F outside in new york city.  I believe this is an error.  My peak
heating load for this space appears correct occurring on jan 23 at 8am.
Solar radiation dominates the total space load at 75% of the total
cooling load.  The overall building peak cooling load occurs on July 1
at 8pm when its 92F outside which appears correct.  What do you think?

Dear Sir,

 Your answer to my previous questions was very helpful. Since we have other
projects which are using LEED-NC-Multiple buildings. My doubt is as follows
"Project site is away from the water body by 98.08 ft but protruding towards
water body by 15 ft from next floor level "due to this it may affect on the
site selection (SS Credit.1). Also note that site area is reclaimed. Please
do the needful

If this is a south-western facing room, this makes sense.  For spaces with
alot of glass, peak cooling loads typically occur in the fall when the sun
sits lower in the sky.  For a western or south-western facing room, at 5pm
in October, the sun is shining directly into the windows.  With a 62 degree
outdoor air temperature, conductive losses are low, so the heat gained by
the space does not have a chance to leave (as it would in December, with
temperatures in the 30's).  Solar gain trumps all other cooling loads in
spaces with large window areas.  You could try modeling an alternative with
a really low SHGC glass, or exterior vertical shades and see how this
affects the peak.

While this is the peak space load, this may not be the peak coil load as
ventilation is not taken into account in the LS-B report (drives me crazy).
It all depends on whether ventilation air is conditioned before it arrives
at the terminal coils or not...

Mike:

Sun angle, sun angle, sun angle !! 

You also didn't mention which way the guest tower was oriented, say as a
tall thin tower with facing directions dominating East and West. The
rest of your hotel is undoubtedly space where internal loads and outside
air are the primary load drivers.  The guest rooms get a smidgen of OSA
and internal load driving it.  October 2 in New York City could also be
an 80 DegF day as well.

I will bet on eQuest (or DOE-2).

I looked into doing this a month ago or so.  I didn't find a way for EnergyPro to read in BDL files.
 
My experience is that EnergyPro is really easy to use, as long as you keep track of your surface areas and spaces.  That's simply because there's no 3D representation, so if you make a mistake with record-keeping, you won't see it right away.  It's got copy/cut/paste for entire zones, and is built for Title 24 compliance (faster, more reliable, and better libraries than eQuest for this app). 
 
But for overall capabilities, it is missing a share of the capabilities that eQuest offers, so in my case, I had to create an EnergyPro model for Title 24, and eQuest model for parametric analysis.  Just as an example, I think in one case I couldn't put a VFD on a hot water pump.

Hello,
?
I defined the miscelleneous equipment load as internal load in my eQUEST baseline model. I can find the energy consumption in kwh in the detail output file. However, where could I find the energy cost for the miscelleneous equipment load because I want to make sure it is at least 25% of the total energy cost in the baseline model? I really appreciate if anyone can give me some hints.
?
Thank
?

Are the .BIN weather data files used by eQUEST in the same format as the .BIN packed weather data file that were used by DOE2.1E? I have some actual annual weather data files for my site that I use to run my models against actual utility data for the same year to help calibrate them. My clients are requesting current work to performed using eQUEST rather than DOE2.1E, but I wanted to be able to do these same calibration checks. If they are not in the same format, is there a conversion utility available?

Just in case there was some confusion, the TMY3 (like TMY2) are not continuous periods of chronological time, they are 12 individual months often from different years that are combined to form one "average" or typical year for simulation purposes.

So the data are (mostly) actual hourly weather observations, but not for one continuous year that would correspond with the utility bills.

Does any one know whether or not eQuest BDL can be trascribed into 
Energy Pro software? I ask because I don't want to duplicate the efforts 
already exerted in eQuest to be able to model a VRF system in Energy Pro.

On that same note, is Energy Pro all that different than eQuest? (In 
terms of the capabilities/inputs/interface/learning-curve/etc.)

Introduction to DesignBuilder Software - One day workshop  


August 02, 2008, Saturday  - (Immediately After SimBuild 2008 conference)
University of California, Berkeley

The objective of this workshop is to introduce DesignBuilder to the users
and simulators who would like to use EnergyPlus simulation tool to model
energy performance of buildings, but without the complexities of working
with arcane input file editor. DesignBuilder is the most comprehensive and
powerful graphical user interface for EnergyPlus. This hands-on training
will provide general overview and introduction to building energy analysis
using DesignBuilder. The trainees will learn to quickly setup a building
model, change the building parameters using components and templates and run
the simulation



For more information and registration, please visit: 



http://www.designbuildersoftware.com/db_workshop.php 



Early registration deadline is July, 15.

Hey All,

I (painstakingly) entered a custom window layout in DD mode on a 4-floor multifamily mid-rise shell, but only the first floor in the shell displays my window layout whether I use the Floor Multiplier or not.  Does anyone know how I can duplicate my custom window layout for all of the floors in the shell? I assumed it would do this with the floor multiplier.  Thanks!

Matthew:

After Eric Shadd's comments, I suddenly realize you were asking about
EnergyPro, not Energy Plus.

I have also used Energy Pro to some extent, as well as eQuest for 3 - 4
years (and DOE-2 for 25 years).

EnergyPro is a DOE-2.1E based program, whereas eQuest is a DOE-2.2
engine. Slightly differently animals. DOE-2.1E has LOADS, SYSTEM, PLANT,
and ECONOMICS. DOE-2.2 has LOADS, HVAC, and ECONOMICS. 

You cannot straight away go from 2.2 back to 2.1E. With GREAT
EXCRUCIATION, you could copy some of 2.1E to 2.2. But I advise against
it.

Energy Pro's main purpose in life (with a nod to it's co-creator and my
friend, Martyn Dodd) is to develop California Title-24 compliance. It
has the Title-24 fixed inputs for schedules, building types, and other
such parameters. You put in the Proposed Building you wish, and Energy
Pro will generate the Base Case building, and tell you how much better
(or worse) your proposed building is to Title-24.

eQuest has a similar "building the proposed, and we will build the base"
approach to California Title-24 compliance.

SOMEWHERE in the Nether world of Energy Pro lies the DOE-2.1E engine.
The RAW (DOS) version. You can probably extract the main 2.1E engine and
run whatever you wish. I am unsure as to what features can actually be
run under this version (primary/secondary pumping, possibly not).

But if you run eQuest, you can either run a California Compliance Run
(and an Oregon Energy Trust compliance with a special version), or you
can run your building with YOUR schedules, YOUR HVAC component EERs and
COPs, YOUR operating parameters, and YOUR utility rates. Anywhere in the
world you can get a TMY type weather year.

Plus features like Primary/secondary pumping, photovoltaic arrays, and
easily developed parametric Runs from the "front end" of eQuest. Other
than the CA compliance software, I am unaware that Energy Pro's raw DOE2
has a front end.

Hope this clarifies a bit more.

Modeling a 30 story hotel with PTACs (9.54 EER) vs. WSHP (12 EER) I am
expecting to see a large cooling energy reduction.  Since the envelopes
are the same I'm expecting to see the full 26% improvement, however I
only see an 11% improvement in cooling energy comparing the BEPS report.
I would expect part load performance to maintain an almost constant
efficiency spread of 25% through the whole part load curve.  But maybe
for some unkown reason to me the efficiency spread decreases
dramatically through part load?  Also is there any way to check overall
building cooling efficiency like divide overall cooling loads into
energy?  Cooling energy can be found on BEPS, but total building cooling
load varies from LS-F and LS-D to SS-D.

PTACs usually have the ability to run an economizer and WSHPs do not.  I am
not sure if you modeled it this way, you would need to check the inputs.
This would account for a drop in savings, but not sure it would account for
everything.  Also, I would expect an increase in pump energy use for the
WSHP system.  In regards to the part load efficiency curves, I have not
studied WSHP and PTACs next to each other.  You might want to make sure that
your curves are normalized to EERs you are inputting.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Heat Recovery - Effectiveness Calculation
Message-ID: <4874EFD0.E70E.0034.0@aeieng.com>

Good afternoon,

I'm currently modeling a laboratory building HVAC system that has a sensible heat recovery system.  The heat recovery system is a water/glycol run-around loop type system.  In eQuest there is an input, under the airside system tab, that allows you to fill in the effectiveness of your heat recovery system.

My question is this, how should I calculate this effectiveness?

Currently, I've calculated the effectiveness based on the design documents.  According to the equipment schedules the exhaust air is at 72 F, and the outside air heat recovery coil has a scheduled performance of 6 F entering and 35.5 F leaving.  Based on these numbers I've calculated a design effectiveness of 44.6%.  Please see the below equation:

35.5 - 6     =   0.446
72  -   6

However, a colleague of mine is wondering if this is the correct way to determine effectiveness for the eQuest program.  He is wondering if the effectiveness might be calculated based on the design air temperature (DAT) that is always leaving the air handler (55 F), or some other way.

Does anyone know?

Sincerely,

The manufacturer of the heat recovery system should be able to provide 
you with this number. It varies by system type and by manufacturer so 
it's best to call the rep of whatever system you are using. I imagine 
they calculate the number based on average conditions and according to 
an industry standard.

Dear all,

In order to perform sustainability analysis, we've been working on
Ecotect software along with the Energy Plus software. Could you please
suggest a software compatible with Ecotect to substitute Energy Plus
that would be more user friendly and less time consuming since we aren't
being able to handle the complications of the Energy Plus inputs with
the time limit of the projects we are dealing with. 

 

Thanks in advance,

Mark,
Given your selection data, I would have calculated effectiveness as 
	(35.5-6)/(55-6)=60%.

However, I think it is worthwhile to get some selections at other than
design conditions, because it is likely that this type of system is most
effective at the coldest outdoor air conditions.  With some different
selections, you might calculate a weighted average efficiency, if eQuest
only allows a single number to be input.

Also, don?t forget to account for the added pressure drop (and fan power) on
the air-side supply and exhaust streams, and the pump power requirement for
the run-around loop.  If the HR coil pressure drop is substantial, it might
be worthwhile to consider a coil bypass option for the many hours between
about 50?F and 80?F when you will not need this heat recovery.

Subject: Spam:[Bldg-sim] Cooling effeciency

Modeling a 30 story hotel with PTACs (9.54 EER) vs. WSHP (12 EER) I am
expecting to see a large cooling energy reduction.  Since the envelopes
are the same I'm expecting to see the full 26% improvement, however I
only see an 11% improvement in cooling energy comparing the BEPS report.
I would expect part load performance to maintain an almost constant
efficiency spread of 25% through the whole part load curve.  But maybe
for some unkown reason to me the efficiency spread decreases
dramatically through part load?  Also is there any way to check overall
building cooling efficiency like divide overall cooling loads into
energy?  Cooling energy can be found on BEPS, but total building cooling
load varies from LS-F and LS-D to SS-D.

Message-ID: <2511ec390807100932i111e015epbf02fd27803b189e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am stuck with a problem of modeling a HVAC system serving the perimeter
zone in eQUEST. I have a four pipe fan coil unit with Chilled water
& Heating water coils which is supported by a roof to Ait to Water heat pump
unit on the roof top. I have tried to use the Fan coil unit system on the
air side system but this system needs a chiller and a boiler on the water
side attached to Chilled water loop and Hot water Loop separately.

I am trying to avoid boiler in this system since my source of heating and
cooling is through a Air to Water heat Pump.

Could any one please suggest a way to model this system. in equest. I have
looked at the archives which had a similar question but the solution was not
clear.

Best Regards,

Adam (or anyone else),

Any progress on this?

I would love to hear how you sorted out your issue.

I am a newbie and need to model a oil fired domestic hot water heater

Can this be done using the wizards?  Or are other tweaks needed?

Message-ID: <BAY112-W37CCF2896314E227A0C2D8CC900@phx.gbl>


Dear all,
 
    I was using eQuest and Window5 on a 64bit window XP and I was prompted with some errors when I was trying to use the window data from Window5 (I was using eQuest sample window file). I'm not sure if a 64bit is the cause so I was wondering if anyone has had this kind of problem before and are there any solutions? 
    Your help is much appreciated.
 
Regards,
Siritip H.

Hi -
My model let eQuest to size the boiler capacity based on 'secondery' demand to
see how large the size of the boiler will be. There are 2 equally sized
boilers. I made the capacity and capacity ratio of each boiler default (blank).
The output report shows the rated capacity for each boiler is 4.037 MBtu/h, and
boiler A works at all spectrum of part load for most hours when heating is
needed, while the boiler B only work several hours at very low part load
percent. The peak load for boiler A is 4.125 MBtu/h, the peak load for boiler B
is only 0.058 MBtu/h.

Since boiler B works less efficiently, I try to downsize the boiler capacity to
reduce equipment cost and heating energy use. If I input a capacity ratio of
<0.5 for each boiler, eQuest will give out a warning that the hot water loop
heating capacity is less than the secondary demand. However, the percent of
hours outside throttling range was not affected.

Is the warning a concern? Or any alternative way to reduce the size of the
boiler and make them ?work? more efficiently in eQuest?

Many thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <1253D478FBC8C741B18466AB40B5CCD402192867@pdxmail1.glumac.com>

There has been a recently discovered compatibility issue between eQUEST version 3.61 and AutoCad 2008. When importing a drawing from AutoCAD 2008 into the eQUEST wizard, eQUEST will generate an error message and delete the dwg file completely leaving the user with no way to recover the file. 
 
To import a dwg while using AutoCAD 2008, go to File -> Save As and save the file as a AutoCAD 2004 file. Note that if you reopen the file in AutoCAD 2008 and only hit "Save" it will change it back to a ACAD 2008 file. 
 
Just another reason to always keep backups.

Yu,

Have a look at the PS-H report for your boilers.  It's likely that eQuest
oversized the boilers dramatically.  You could look at the percentage of
time the main boiler spends above the 50% of full load bin and if the number
of hours is not significant, limit the boiler capacity accordingly.

You can also control the boiler staging with an equipment control
(EQUIP-CTRL keyword).  Have a look at the DOE2 help files for instructions
on how to set one up.  An excerpt: "This command allows you to override the
default load allocation routines (in which the program automatically selects
the mix of equipment with a combined capacity most closely matching the load
but preventing an overload condition)."

Hope this helps,
Steven

Try running the simulation with one boiler to get the auto-sizing.  Then enter your own sizing for each when you add the second boiler, whatever that percentage would be.

I tried put the capacity ratio of 0.5 for each boiler, the results remained the
same. eQuest said if no CAPACITY-RATIO is specified, the capacity defaults to
the maximum design-day heating loop capacity, divided by the number of boilers
attached to the loop, and multiplied by the loop?s SIZING-RATIO.

The heating energy use drop a lot and boiler B will work a little bit better if
a ratio of <0.5 is used for each boiler.

Hey all,

Does anyone know how I can change the window placement in a text file (the .pd2 I assume) so that I don't have to painstakingly go through the wizard and enter custom window placement data for all top, middle, and ground floors?  I opened the .pd2 file with wordpad and tried copying the custom window placement data (that I entered while in the wizard) and pasted it below where I copied it from, changing only the facet numbers (e.g., from facet-0-1 31" to facet-2-1), yet it did not work.  Also, I don't know what the 31",  32" 33", etc., numbers are after the first set of facet numbers in the code.  Thanks a lot!

Sizing in eQUEST is always a problem. I ran an office model with a HW loop.
PV-A report calculates the heating capacity of the HW loop to be 0.834
MBtu/h and size each boiler to be 0.417 MBtu/h. However PS-D indicates the
peak load of the loop is 0.4117 MBtu/h, less than the capacity of a single
boiler. This is why one boiler is enough to meet the load.

If we want both boilers to carry similar load, the size of each boiler shall
be 0.206 MBth/h, half of 0.4117 MBtu/h.  The sizing ratio of each boiler
ought to be 0.206/0.834 (HW loop capacity from PV-A report) =0.247.

This change brought similar loads to both boilers and improved their overall
efficiency.

Hi Sir, 
 
We are trying to identify a database which would comprise information on
commercial buildings, their area of occupancy, and energy efficient measures
adopted by these buildings in the region of Europe.
 
We are looking for a Database on European Commercial Building Facilities.
The database should comprise information around;
 
1.	Number and name of Commercial Buildings in Europe (Buildings to be
considered are those whose area is greater than 100,000 square feet) 
2.	Site Addresses of Buildings 
3.	Energy efficient measures being adopted by the companies 
 
Please do let us know if you have an access to such a database and if you
could provide us with such information. 
 
Thanks and Regards,

I am using EE4 to do energy simulations, as required her for energy grant

each product adapted to local conditions. Does anyone have experience (they
wish to share) with modeling Ground Source Heat Pump systems with in-floor
heating and 4-pipe fan coil units for air distribution? The EE4 simulation

not very useful much of the time. Any help is greatly appreciated.

In-floor heating system could be modeled as a 4-pipe fan coil system that
requires no fan energy, see Page 6-8 of the modeling guide.

 

Then model the plant as "Combination Ground Source Heat Pump/Boiler Plants",
see page 4-17 of the modeling guide.

Set up a series of ASSIGN statements to different logical units.  For
example:

ASSIGN \TRNSYS16\Weather\City_1.dat   20
ASSIGN \TRNSYS16\Weather\City_2.dat   21
ASSIGN \TRNSYS16\Weather\City_3.dat   22

The have an equation that "picks" the correct file:

EQUATIONS 1
LU_Data=21

Then simply use the equation name in lieu of the numerical value in the
parameter specification:

UNIT 9 Type 9 Data Reader
Parameters 3
1  LU_Data  1


Now use the parametric table option and vary the value of LU_Data to
effectively choose different files.

Leonard,

I did eventually figure out that Oil-Fired boilers can only be specified
once you have switched into Detailed Mode. You can then specify the
boiler as a Hot Water boiler with either Forced or natural draft, and
assign a fuel meter to it, therefore changing it to oil-fired.

Any other questions, let me know!

Adam (or Brian),

Any progress on this?

I would love to hear how you sorted out your issue.

I am a newbie and need to model a oil fired domestic hot water heater
with eQuest.

Can this be done using the wizards?  Or are other tweaks needed?

While trying to model an existing apartment complex, I am running into a
bit of a roadblock- it appears that eQuest only has the option for a
Natural Gas-Fired Boiler, and the building I am modeling has Oil-Fired
Boilers. Does anyone have experience with this issue, or have any
insight as to what might be the best way to model this situation? I
would have thought eQuest would have something as common as an oil-fired
boiler as a standard option for a heat source.

Any help is appreciated!

Hi,

I was trying to use the weather file converter (eQ_WthProc) on the DOE wesite, which is used to convert epw files to bin files for use in equest / VisualDOE. I'm just following the steps given on the DOE website, But somehow, when i try to convert, I'm getting an error message saying 'invalid file name'. I'm not quite sure what this means. Has anybody used this program, and has anybody faced this problem ?
?

Message-ID: <1272EF6C1E2CB14796327D1DA394577DE7DC74@NDMSEVS33B.ndc.nasa.gov>


Hey everyone,

I am currently working on deciding between using HAP or eQuest for our
building load calculations and energy models.  We are working on having
our third LEED certified building, so that will play a big role in the
choice. The AE firms we are currently using already use HAP, so there
would have to be a tranisition to eQuest and also their engineers(as
well as myself) would need to learn the ins-and-outs of the program.
Any definite advantages to either one?  Also any opinions on the matter
would be greatly appreciated.  



 Thanks

I am modeliOng a 100% OA with heat recovery in heat model. Under the tab of control sequences, I choose OA-EXHAUST-DT with 10 F?. However, the heat recovery runs for the whole year. Can I run heat recovery when the outside air temperature is below 60 F? I really appreciate if you could give some feedback.

Hi everybody,

>From this address: www.bwk.tue.nl/bps/*hensen*/courseware/
CVUT-capita/resources/ibpsa-usa_for_engineers.pdf,  I have found the file
titled as "Overview of Simulation". This file is presented at IBPSA - USA,
2006.

Since the following sentence is stated in the 3rd page, I couldn't find the
version, which was prepared for architects:

"The following presentation was developed in 2003 for IPBSA-USA in response
to an RFP. The presentations were developed to promote the use of simulation
as integral in the building design process. OWP/P and Michael Roy Iversen,
Architect were contacted by IBPSA-USA to develop two presentations: one for
architects and the other for engineers."

Is there anyone, who knows, how could I find the one, which was developed
for architects?

Hey all,

Has anyone tried do download the eQuest version 3.60b update and been asked to enter a registration code upon trying to install it?  How does one obtain a registration code?  Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQUEST - City Chilled Water Loop and ASHRAE Appendix G
Message-ID: <487E082C.395C.0080.0@auseea.com>

How do you model a building that is attached to a city chilled water loop?
 
and
 
Have any of you had experience with ASHRAE 90.1 Append. G, Table G3.1, 1c where it says "All conditioned spaces in the proposed design shall be simulated as being both heated and cooled even if no heating or cooling system is to be installed,..."?
 
We modeled a building that had heated vehicle maintenance bays, so by the ASHRAE standard it would seem that we could not model it that way, but would have to model it as being heated AND cooled.
 
Any ideas or experience would be greatly appreciated.
 
 
Thanks,

In the component tree, just right click on the wall to create a new child component that can be a window / door.

Dan,

 

Once you save and reopen the program, the window will be grouped with the
other windows belonging to the same parent wall in the spreadsheet view.

 

Also, the spreadsheet view will sort like an excel spreadsheet if you click
on the column heading in the header row.  You can cause a sort by object
name, object type, etc.

Hey all,

For my eQUEST simulations so far, I have traced the footprint and HVAC zones from an AUTOcad file from the architect, simply drawing lines in my best "eyeball" of the middle of the walls, and then imported this CAD file to trace in eQUEST.  Do any of you building simulation/eQUEST pros use better methods, or is the current one I use sufficient?  Also, if I make changes in the Detailed Interface, they will be saved as long as I never switch back to a wizard, right?  Thanks a lot,

Sim list,

                I noticed that there are two different locations in
eQUEST where one can specify zone-types (Conditioned, Unconditioned &
Plenum). Under the Internal Loads tab it can be specified as well as
under the Air-Side HVAC tab. I understand that the Internal Loads tab is
for spaces  while the Air-Side HVAC tab is for zones but I don't
understand what the difference would be in specifying different
zone-types in either tab. Does anyone know what effect this could have
if they were different

 

Thanks

Message-ID: <1901717528DF6E4EA2EEB294C11E78505620EF@MULTIORG1.cgnetmo.org>

Michael,

Regarding modeling "extra" systems for conditioned spaces, the key is
"conditioned" spaces. See the definition of "conditioned space" in the
standard. If a space has no heating or cooling, it is not a conditioned
space. The User's Manual for ASHRAE 90.1-2004 clarifies that "This
requirement only applies to conditioned spaces in the building.
Semiheated spaces would only have a heating system; unconditioned spaces
would have neither heating nor cooling systems." (p. G-21) See the
definition for "semiheated space" too. I believe the intent here is to
add a cooling system to spaces that only have a heating system and add a
heating system to spaces that only have a cooling system.

If the model is for LEED, the LEED-NC v2.2 Reference Guide clarifies it.
"For areas of the project without heating or cooling systems (such as
parking garages), there is no need to model heating or cooling systems
in either the Proposed or Baseline Designs." (p. 181)

I don't know of any restrictions on the thermostat settings, so you
might be able to just make the thermostat setting of the fictitious
system pretty extreme so that the system rarely (or never) comes on.
This would satisfy the requirement to have a system, but keep your
energy consumption numbers more realistic.

Regarding your first question when you're modeling a building connected to a city chilled water loop: 
First -?be aware that LEED recently issues new modeling rules for this exact situation.? The document is called "Required Treatment of District Thermal Energy"? and is located at usgbc.org/LEED/LEED Resources/LEED Reference Documents.? If your project was registered BEFORE?May 28, 2008, then you can elect to follow these rules.? If you're project was registered AFTER that date, then you MUST?follow the new rules.? The rules?basically effect the baseline building systems that are modeled....i.e. so what you're comparing yourself to.? 
In terms of modeling the situation, (I'm not an Equest user....but, if it's similar to Trace at the plant simulation?level) you'd choose "purchased chilled water" as the equipment/system type.? Then you'd input the cost of your chilled water (per therm or other similar unit that your software uses)?in the economics portion of the software.

Dear all,

Using Genopt with ESP-r I end up with a run that does not converge for 2 out
of the six parameters. Looking in detail at my results, it seems that genopt
does not search the whole spectrum I allow (or request) it to take into
account. However, I do use the particle swarm algorithm combined with a
pattern search algorithm.

Has anyone encountered a similar problem and knows how to solve that?

thanks,

Please excuse the cross-postings...

 

Dear Colleagues,
  Just a friendly reminder that a one-day Introduction to DesignBuilder
course will be held on Saturday- August 2nd at , the University of
California - Berkeley, immediately after the IBPSA-USA SimBuild 2008
conference. The objective of this workshop is to introduce DesignBuilder to
the users and simulators who would like to use EnergyPlus simulation tool to
model energy performance of buildings, but without the complexities of
working with arcane input file editor. DesignBuilder is the most
comprehensive and powerful graphical user interface for EnergyPlus. This
hands-on training will provide general overview and introduction to building
energy analysis using DesignBuilder. The trainees will learn to quickly
setup a building model, change the building parameters using components and
templates and run the simulation.

 

 

A fully functional 3 months trial version of DesignBuilder will be
distributed to all trainees at the training venue.

 For more information and registration, please visit:

Subject: [Bldg-sim] cogeneration in eQuest
Message-ID: <48849384.9060501@aiguasol.coop>

Hello,
When introducing a cogeneration / trigeneration system in eQuest the 
electrical engine is not shown in the plant equipment schematics (its 
relations with the different water loops). Is it like this or am I 
missing something?
On the other hand, the program seems to associate the fuel consumption 
of the generation engine to the different building electricity demands 
on a proporcional manner. Is it so?. If so, I supose that first 
discounts the amount used stright in thermal applications. Is it like this?
Is there a place where the way energy flows a for 
cogeneration/trigeneration systems are dealt with in eQuest is documented?
Regards,

	workshop prior to SimBuild2008
Message-ID: <20080721163657.882C448003@diego.dreamhost.com>

Simulation Colleagues:

This is a reminder that a 2-day eQUEST workshop in Berkeley CA to be held on
Jul 28 & 29, immediately prior to SimBuild2008. 

 

This workshop differs from other eQUEST workshops in the following respects:

- The focus will be on conducting LEED EA analysis using eQUEST (emphasis on
ASHRAE 90.1 but includes Title24).

- The second day will emphasize HVAC efficiency options.

- Steve Gates, principal author of the water-side portions of eQUEST/DOE-2,
will team teach the second day.

 

The first day workshop (28Jul08) is: Schematic Design & Analysis for LEED
using eQUEST, 

The second day workshop (29Jul08) is: Detailed Design & Analysis for LEED
using eQUEST,

 

Owing to Steve Gates participation, the second day workshop should be of
particular interest to experienced eQUEST users. 

Details and registration for this eQUEST workshop are available online at
www.regonline.com/equest. 

 

 

Whether you plan to attend this eQUEST workshop in Berkeley, please consider
attending SimBuild2008 in Berkeley, later the same week.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] mechanical ventilation independent from air cooling
	system in eQuest
Message-ID: <4884C3DB.20405@aiguasol.coop>

Hello,
Which is the best way to deal with a mechanical ventilation system (with 
economizer and heat recovery options) independent from the air cooling 
system?
To reproduce the physical system, two air systems should be defined for 
each zone, one for cooling (for example split system single zone DX), 
and another for ventilation (each one with its own fans). Would it be 
possible to define two air systems for a zone?
The other option is to trying to include the ventilation system effects 
into the air cooling system, but it won't lead to a precise treatment of 
both fans.
What do you think?
Regards,

Does anyone know when an Air Cooled Chiller can be used as the baseline

ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G makes it clear that a Cooling Tower must be
used.  

 

Yet an old Credit Interpretation Report  (CIR) for LEED V2.0 states that
an Air Cooled Chiller can be used as the baseline for any chiller under
150 tons.

Ian,
LEED 2.0 referenced the old ECB method, LEED 2.2 references the PRM and depending on the building size, the baseline VAV systems jump from a DX/VAV to a "Standard" VAV with CHW from either screw or centrifugal chillers (under 2007 revisions, the choice of which is dependent on the baseline load). 
 
There is no such beast as an air-cooled chiller anywhere in the PRM baseline, unless it serves a process load same as in the proposed building.

Dan,
 
The ventilation presets in HAP are wholly based on space usage types
from ASHRAE Standard 62-2001or 62.1-2004 (depending on your project
preference setting).  So whatever space usage types you see in the
standard you'll also have in HAP.  I don't see an "Apartment" space
usage type in either Std 62-2001 or 62.1-2004.  It looks to me like the
closest thing is the "Hotel, Motel, Resort, Dormitory" group of space
usage types - the same usage types you've found.
 
BTW - As a HAP licensee you and your firm are entitled to free,
unlimited software support via 800-253-1794 and

Hi -
ASHRAE 90.1-2004 requires heating capacity sized with 1.25 ratio in the
baseline. For the system #8, VAV w/PFP, there is no air-side heating sizing
ratio input in eQuest (heat
source is installed at zone level).
How did you model this?

Thanks in advance,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQuest Crashing & Modeling Gas-fired Desiccant Systems
Message-ID: <002f01c8ee6c$54484440$2f01a8c0@Studer>

Hello!



We are modeling a complex HVAC system with multiple gas-fired desiccant
wheels, fresh air units, and air handling units.  We have had to be rather
creative to shoehorn this system into eQuest, and have basically set up the
fresh air units as VAV systems serving ghost zones and provide 39?F outside
air to the desiccant units. The desiccant units are modeled as VAV systems
serving ghost zones and provide 80?F fresh air to the main AHUs.  The main
AHUs are modeled in the standard way but receive fresh air from the
desiccant system.  The ghost zones have air walls and interior space
temperature setpoints equal to the anticipated discharge temps from the FAUs
and DDs).  Heating and cooling design and control temperatures are offset by
2?F in the ghost spaces.



The model runs and generates an output file, but then the program crashes
immediately afterward.  The following Windows error message is displayed:



The instruction at "0x73dd11c7" referenced memory at "0x00000004".  The
memory could not be "read".



The only other time I have gotten this kind of message was when I put a
period in the file name of the model file (e.g. ?90.1 Base Case?), and we
are not making this mistake here.  We can run the model and get results, but
geez is reloading the thing annoying!  Does anybody out there have any
suggestions?  Could the goofiness of modeling three systems in series be the
culprit?



We tried using the system type ?packaged solid gas desiccant? (PSGD) but
there does not appear to be a way to have the DD unit get air from the fresh
air unit and there is not a way to put pre-cooling coils on the PSGD system.
Does anyone have any suggestions about how to model this ventilation system:
FAU ? DD ? AHU?

I am modeling an existing building that has packaged DX main air handling units with PIU terminals in perimeter zones and straight VAV terminals in interior zones. Using the packaged VAV system doesn't let me have PIU terminals, and using the PIU system requires a chilled water loop. Is there a way to have PIUs on packaged systems?

Thanks for any reply.

Hey all,

On the Activity Areas Allocation screen in eQuest I am trying to understand the under the Assign First To... section; I have only two Activity Areas, a dwelling unit and a corridor, and when I check to assign the dwelling unit to perimeter and the corridor to the core and then go to the next screen (Zone Group Definitions), it gives that 100% of the perimeter is the dwelling unit (as it should), but it gives that only 76.8% of the core is corridor (when it should be 100%) and 23.2% is dwelling unit (when it should be 0%).  Does anybody know why it does this?  Thanks,

     -Dan

My understanding is that Equest decides where the division between
perimeter & core is - it is not determined by the placement of your
interior walls. I believe this is done because the perimeter & core
zones are used for assessing the amount of daylighting penetration as
well as differences in heat loss to the exterior of the envelope. There
is a maximum depth to the perimeter zone, and if the depth of your
apartments exceeds that depth then part of the apartments will be
assumed to be part of the core zone, meaning they'll have higher
lighting needs (barring the use of skylights), and lower heating needs
in winter but higher cooling needs in summer. Irregardless of where you
place your interior walls, there is little you can do to increase the
depth of daylighting penetration into a building (solatubes get modeled
as skylights, but fiber optic sunlight distribution & mirror
lightshelves aren't easily modeled yet), so Equest's perimeter
assumptions make sense. Don't worry, it is modeling your project
correctly.

Hi;

Could I suggest a Open SuSE Linux style  Dot Org effort to produce web 
video training clips ??
We could post them somewhere...  That way we don't have to travel, The 
experts don't have to travel,
and  everybody gets bumped up 2 to 3 levels so we're all not stuck "in 
first gear"

The Energy+ guys are just getting started on this kind of idea.........  
but it is live only, and sporadic.

We , mid level modelers , could use a regular say every two weeks video 
that is 30 minutes to 60 minutes and save the old ones......

We could also use parsing programs to cut common known mistakes in input 
format although this is more of an Energy + problem.

I think this is a quick question.

Does anyone know the typical value for process/receptacle loads (W/sf) in
warehouse areas, probably given in AHRAE 90.1 User's Manual?

Any help would be appreciated.

Seems like it should be easy but I can not get eQuest to print the
standard "Single-Run Reports" (or any other) in color.  I see the report
in color on my screen and I have set all standard window devices to
print color but no matter what I do, the reports print in black and
white.  I am currently using eQuest version 6.1 but also had the same
issue when I used version 6.0.

 

Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

I've not had that problem w/ Equest so much, but have had problem's
printing at all from certain websites that are protective of
intellectual property. Two work-arounds to try:

1. Print to .pdf first. You can download free pdf printing software for
MS windows environments (as well as a free .pdf editor) from the
pdf995.com website. Once installed, it works just like printing to any
other printer from any application you are using; in your print dialogue
box use the printer drop down menu to choose "pdf995" as the printer to
send to, make any changes to settings as needed to get the print preview
to look as you want it to, then tell it to print, and it generates a
.pdf file. Then you can print that .pdf to paper using a regular printer
or just e-mail it to clients.

If even the above doesn't work, as has happened to me when a website is
blocking printing altogether, the ultimate fallback failsafe is:
2. Use "screen capture" to save the entire contents of the screen (or
the window of your choice on my Mac) as a graphic image file. If you
search Windows Help for "screen capture", you should find instructions
for how to do this on your operating system. I last used a Windows
machine several years ago and it worked then, so I'd really be surprised
if Windows doesn't support this basic functionality anymore. On the Mac
it is done with the "Grab" application in the "utilities" folder under
"Applications". The downside of using a screen capture is that for a
multi-page report you have to view each page on the screen and capture
it separately manually. But once you've got the images, you can crop out
anything irrelevant with photo editing software and then reassemble them
into a multi-page report by inserting them into something like MS Word.
You can also pick and choose among images and add your own commentary
this way to fit it to the comprehension skills of your audience.

Hope this helps if you can't figure out what Equest or your printer
drivers are doing wrong,
Christina

	is now available
Message-ID: <B94620A0857DFE4DB194C4A2DBDC088F0186FBC2@BE-SCAM2.ds.strath.ac.uk>


A new edition of the ESP-r Cookbook and Exercises volume is available on the
ESRU web page for download <www.esru.strath.ac.uk> in the publications
page.  

This edition has expanded to 170 pages and has new chapters on operational
schedules and the art of creating air flow networks as well as a summary of 
the computational capabilities of ESP-r. 

More emphasis is placed on strategy and methods for translating client questions and
working drawings into models which are fit-for-purpose.  This would be useful 
reading for anyone or any team using numerical assessments. 

The dialogue has been updated to reflect the current interface and includes
expert tips as well as warnings about the places where the dragons live. 

The exercises have been updated and tied into the body of the Cookbook
and are better suited for coursework and workshops. 

The layout is now double column and sized for printing at B4, two
pages per A4, or scaled to 85% for extra large margins on A4.

Work is underway on chapters about simulation team working practices
(with checklists) and ensuring model quality (more checklists).  

Enjoy and spread the word!  ESRU is interested in helping to co-ordinate
efforts to translate the Cookbook into other languages.  Please email
me if you want to join in the effort.

Regards, Jon Hand.

Message-ID: <960166.48527.qm@web50807.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

I don't think Trace has a specific way or pre-programmed feature that could be used to model this.
Your best bet is to figure out an equivalent shading factor or over hang.? Maybe the mftr could give you an equivalent shading coefficient.? 
Other options would be:
1. Divide the window into two windows from an input standpoint based on what percentage of the window is shaded from the louver.? Input the portion that is shaded into trace with an overhang or with a north exposure or as spandrel glass.
2. Input the window as?many smaller windows each with their own individual overhang.? Although, this would probably take a long time from an input standpoint and may slow down running the program.
Maybe you could do a separate trace run looking at one window with louvers on each exposure using Option 2 above.? Then?use the results to figure out an effective shading coefficient or equivalent overhang to use in your main Trace file.

build VE1-2M Silkscreen glazing.  Normally, I would just build the
VE1-2M in Window 5 and add the frit in eQuest, but I was wondering if
anyone out there knew how to create the whole glazing unit in Window 5
or Optics?

My baseline system is System 5: Packaged VAV w/ reheat, but 90.1 doesn't
specify the minimum airflow percentage and I'm not sure what to use.
Equest defaults the min VAV airflow at 40% in core zones and 30% in
perimeter zones.  Increasing this number to 100% (cv) nearly doubles the
heating energy.  Since this is such a sensitive number, it's accuracy is
critical, what do you think I should use?

Mike,
Addendum AM revised G3.1.3.13 to alternatively allow the zone minimum ventilation flow, but I get lost when I think about how that is supposed to be calculated.

Is the minimum ventilation air the same as the % OA at the system or is it the zone minimum OA without any multi-space impacts?
Remembering that Std 62's method for determining system level OA in a multi-space VAV system is dependent on
1) the zone design flow rate which you are now auto sizing
2) the zone minimum zone flow rate which you are trying to determine

G3.1.25 is clear that minimum ventilation rates should be the same between the models (excepting DCV) and that kind of makes sense at a system level.  But potential collisions still exist when system supply air volume is lower than the minimum outside air volume or when you want to claim ventilation effectiveness impacts.

Whatever you come up, with eQUEST will accept a minimum cfm/sf in the detailed mode.

I asked a question on the eQUEST forum a while back by accident (meant to ask it here) and got no response.

Has anyone successfully completed a LEED project with IES<VE>? It seems to meet all the requirements of Appendix G, but I have never heard of anyone successfully using it.

Thanks,

Is TRNSYS a qualified tool? I am not quite sure how TRNSYS handles building geometry.

Thanks

Does anyone know if USGBC keeps a list of "qualified" energy modeling tools for LEED NC certification?

Message-ID: <48506176BF20D547B9BE5CBD7C42667803E272C1@fkusa-exchange>

Steve,

 

I recently ran some glazing alternatives for a client and I actually
called up Viracon to get Window5 data for fritted VE1-2M.  I think
they've got a couple different frits and you can choose the percentage
of frit you want them to run it at.  From what I recall, the
representative I spoke to explained that they used a separate software
to generate the glass properties.  Let me know if you'd like me to send
you the data he has sent me-it does take them a while to run them and
then put the data in a table.

 

Hope that helps!

We are considering using IES but it doesn't appear to be able to

Mike,

I believe this is specified in Appendix G.

Daniel,

I personally would make this a separate "shell". Others may have other 
ideas.

Hi everyone,
?
I ran eQUEST model and got the message "Runs Completed Succesfully". Then when I clicked "view summary results/report" tab, there was no?summary in project/runs. I can open the detail output files with all the informations there. Even I reinstalled eQUEST and still have the same problem. Does?anyone have any ideas how to solve the problme?
?
Thanks

When eQuest runs, it creates a couple .csv files with run results.  these
files contain monthly total energy use and peak use in all categories,
summed for the building.  Perhaps eQuest cannot find these files?  The files
are usually placed in the project folder.  I have never had this problem
before, but this is where I would start.
