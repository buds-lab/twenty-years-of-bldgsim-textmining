Subject: [BLDG-SIM] EnergyPlus V1.3.0 Now Available
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200604251607.AA0750875pd80001064526@gard.com>

EnergyPlus Version 1.3.0 Now Available

The tenth major version of EnergyPlus (1.3.0) was 
released on April 21, 2006 and is now available 
in versions for both the Windows and Linux 
operating systems.  Download this newest release 
at no cost from the EnergyPlus web site: 
<http://www.energyplus.gov/>www.energyplus.gov.

What's New in Version 1.3.0?

A few of the new features in EnergyPlus V 1.3 are 
listed below?see 
<http://www.energyplus.gov/features.html>www.energyplus.gov/features.html 
for a complete list of new features added in this and previous versions:

    * UFAD (Under Floor Air Distribution) room 
air model for exterior zones is now available.
    * Completely reworked airflow modeling?the 
new AirflowNetwork model replaces both COMIS and 
ADS and has the combined 
capabilities.  Calculation of infiltration, 
ventilation, mixing and cross mixing moved to 
system time step for future feature development 
of hybrid (mixed mode) ventilation control. 
Differences in results are usually minor.
    * Outside air temperature is now varied as a 
function of zone or surface height above 
ground.  Wind profile options can be set 
separately for the weather station and the 
building site.  Includes new zone and surface 
report variables for height dependent properties. 
There will be differences in results, 
particularly in files with Ventilation or Infiltration.
    * Simple earth tube model for preconditioning 
(heating/cooling) outside air.
    * Tempering valve (3-way valve emulation) for 
effective and safe use of stored thermal energy.
    * Variable and constant speed headered pumps.
    * Detailed ice storage.
    * New Compact HVAC models for fan powered 
VAV, fan coil, night cycle controls, outside air 
heat recovery, supply air temperature reset, 
chilled/hot water temperature reset, VAV supply 
fan part-load options, VAV fan blow through or 
draw through option, and zone supply and return plenums.
    * Energy end-use subcategories are now user-definable.
    * New report variable for Zone Operative 
Temperature (Operative Temperature Control planned for V 1.4 in October).

And many other enhancements and significant speed improvements throughout.


Update on User Interfaces?

Several interfaces and utilities for EnergyPlus 
are now available.  EP-Quick creates an 
EnergyPlus input file based on a broad range of 
zone templates.  EP-Quick was released in April 
2005.  E2AC is an interface in Portuguese and 
English available since January 2005 (more 
languages are planned).  DesignBuilder, a graphic 
user interface, was released in December 
2005.  EFEN is now available in beta version for 
users to test.  Green Building Studio can take an 
existing CAD file and convert to an EnergyPlus 
input file. Several other interfaces are under 
development.  Watch our web site 
(<http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_interfaces.html>www.energyplus.gov/ep_interfaces.html) 
for up-to-date information on these and other interfaces.

A number of utilities and tools for creating, 
editing, and running input files come with 
EnergyPlus, including IDF Editor, EP-Launch, and 
HVAC-Diagram (see 
<http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_utilities.html>www.energyplus.gov/ep_utilities.html). 
Third party tools for creating, editing, and 
displaying EnergyPlus input files are also 
available, including DrawBDL, EcoTect,  ESP-r, 
Green Building Studio, EzDrawPlus, IFCtoIDF, 
TSe+, and EzPlus-Parm.  See

What?s going on in V1.3.0?

Will there be any considerable difference between version 1.3.0 and 1.2.3?

Yes.... and no. There are a number of new features and bug fixes.

How about IDF and IDD? Do they remain unchanged?

There are some changes in the IDD that are 
reflected in IDFs. Particularly for any new 
features, there will be new objects.

Is version 1.3.0 backward compatible? Can I run a v1.2.3 file in v 1.3.0?

For the most part, the answer is yes. There are 
many changes that require you to transition to 
V1.3.0. EP-Launch will now check the selected 
file (if there is a version object) and you can 
launch the Transition program from the EP-Launch 
?File? menu.  You can also view the ObjectStatus 
spreadsheet in the root folder of the installed 
version. This file has detailed explanations of changes to the objects.
This is particularly important for existing input 
files with COMIS objects ? they are both 
internally and externally transitioned but will 
not be internally transitioned in the next 
release.  If you have both COMIS and ADS objects 
in your input file ? please contact email support 
(<mailto:EnergyPlus-Support at gard.com>EnergyPlus-Support at gard.com) 
for assistance.

Since many of you readers are using Appendix G of Standard 90.1 for modeling LEED rated buildings you should be aware that Table G.3.1.5 states in the description of the baseline building for WWR;

 " Vertical fenestration areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed design or 40% of gross above grade wall area, whichever is smaller, and shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four orientations."

As for the last part of that requirement, distributing fenestration uniformly in horizontal bands across the four orientations, that has been removed in Addendum A to the 2004 Standard, but will not be updated in the published version until 2007.

Possibly the interpretation of what is gross wall area depends on what
version of 90.1 you are looking at.  As for 90.1-2004, the official
interpretation on the ASHRAE web site leaves no doubt that "gross wall area"
include both above- and below-ground walls.  See the following item verbatim
from the ASHRAE web site.

 

INTERPRETATION IC 90.1-2004-1 OF ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA STANDARD 90.1-2004

Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings

 

 

Date Approved June 25, 2005

 

Request from: Roger Chang (E-mail: roger.chang at arup.com), Associate Member,
155 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10013.

 

Reference:  This request for interpretation refers to the requirements
presented in ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004, Section 5.2.1 Compliance,
relating to gross wall area.

 

Background: Standard 90.1-2004 does not appear to be clear as to what gross
wall area means. International Energy Conservation Code is clear that
prescriptive requirements are based on window to above-grade wall area. This
impacts all sections of the code where the window-to- wall area ratio is
taken into consideration.

 

 

Interpretation: Gross wall area refers to above-grade wall only.

 

 

Question:  Is this interpretation correct?

 

 

Answer:  No.

 

 

Comments:

 

Section 3.2 defines "building envelope" to include "the elements of a
building*that enclose...spaces through which thermal energy may be
transferred to or from the exterior".

 

Section 3.2, in the definition of "wall" states "this includes above- and
below-grade walls, between floor spandrels, peripheral edges of floors, and
foundation walls".

 

Section 3.2 defines "gross wall area" as "the area of the wall measured on
the exterior face from the top of the floor to the bottom of the roof".

 

Therefore, for buildings with conditioned space below-grade, the gross wall
area extends from the top of the surface of the floor of the lowest
conditioned space to the bottom of the roof of the highest conditioned
space.

 

(Note that the use of a similar term in a document from another organization
is irrelevant to an interpretation of Standard 90.1.)

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] WWR definition

 

Rene, Larry and Gerald,

 

I think that the the underground wall area should be included for each floor
that has windows.  These windows in partially below ground stories are
providing light and views that are no less important than similar functions
provided on upper floors.  However, if I have a skyscraper with 4 stories of
underground garage of basement areas, I don't think these fully underground
wall areas should be included.  Rene, in evaluating the energy and cost
impacts of windows in buildings, it is important to look at the potential
for daylighting or the value of view, otherwise an engineering analysis
might conclude that we don't need any windows at all.

 

Perhaps this should be brought up with the 90.1 envelope committee.

It depends on the code in use. 

 

I submitted an official request (CM proposal) to the ASHRAE 90.1 Envelope
committee to change the definition to only include the above grade walls but
they declined it so it is still the above and below grade walls. The reason
I sent the request is that architects tend to add more glazing to the above
grade walls because they can include the below grade walls in the
definition. I showed some modeling results of the difference between a two
story building with one above and below grade wall in a few difference
cities in the US and there was a significant energy impact.

 

However, I believe the IECC includes only the above grade walls.

Gerald et al,

 

The conventional definition of window-wall-ratio is the window area divided
by the "gross" wall area, though the term "window-wall-ratio" is no longer
among the Definitions section of 90.1-2004.  For that matter, WWR is not
defined in the Abbreviations section.

 

Notwithstanding all that, the definition for "Gross Wall Area" is clearly
defined in the 90.1-2004 User's Manual.

 

On page 5-30, example 5-G addresses "Determining Gross Wall Area", stating
that this is very significant since the window area requirements are based
on Window-Wall-Ratio (WWR).  

 

Answer (as shown on the same page):  "The gross wall area includes both
above-grade walls and below-grade walls so that gross wall area is simply
the perimeter of the building * times the height*"

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Need help on eQuest - library entries
References: <MDAEMON-F200604251113.AA1338625pd80001654920@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200604251327.AA2750156pd80001064329@gard.com>

DOE-2.2, used either stand-alone or in eQUEST, has two libraries:
one is the DOE-2.2 default library (called BDLLIB.dat) and the
other is the "user" library.  For stand-alone DOE-2.2 the user library
is called USRLIB.dat and comes mostly empty.  In eQUEST, the
user library is set to reference eQ_Lib.dat which contains all the
wizard and other eQUEST referenced default entries.

When using either stand-alone DOE-2.2 or eQUEST we advise against
changing BDLLIB.dat.  Using stand-alone DOE-2.2 all user entries are best placed
into USRLIB.dat and then when you send an .inp file to someone you need
to also send the usrlib.dat entries that are referenced by the BDL input
file.  When running an eQUEST generated BDL file in stand-alone DOE-2.2
it will be necessary to copy eQ_Lib.dat into USRLIB.dat if the wizard was used
to generate the input or non-DOE-2.2 defaults entries were fetched from the
detail mode.  If the DOE-2.2 USRLIB.dat has entries that are also needed
it will be necessary to make a new library by combining the two files (easy
with a text editor.)

The input file you are using probably has references to user added entries to
either the BDLLIB.dat or USRLIB.dat ... you need the other person to send you
those entries that can then be added to the end of eQ_Lib.dat (making a backup
first)  Note that releases of eQUEST frequently include altered eQ_Lib.dat files
and releases of DOE-2.2 (and thus eQUEST) sometimes contain altered versions
of BDLLIB.dat ... so care mush be taken when adding your own entries to ensure
that you don't use duplicate names of DOE-2/eQUEST entries and that you don't
replace files containing your entries when installing updates.

Note that DOE-2 searches libraries sequentially from beginning to end starting with
the user library then the bdllib; so if duplicate names exist, the first one found will be used.
Thus, user library entries can "replace" DOE-2 default ... which can be very dangerous
and produce bad results.

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Need help on eQuest


  Dear All,

  I am Gang. I obtained a simulation model (let's call it Original Source Model) defined using DOE-2.2 (version 44c3). The file name is *.INP. I am trying to modify it using eQuest3.55 since the eQuest3.55 included the latest DOE-2.2 (version 44c3).

  When I open the Original Source Model using eQuest3.55, there are ~40 errors found in BDL. For example: "A MATERIAL property is zero or negative". I want to correct these errors using eQuest3.55 platform. My questions are: 

  1. Whether is any confict between the model (*.INP) developed using general DOE-2.2 version 44c3 with eQuest3.55? I mean, does eQuest3.55 recognize all the BNL codes from DOE-2.2 version 44c3? Is it possible that the model developed in DOE-2.2 version 44cs can correctly run in DOE-2.2 but not in eQuest?

  2. Since my Orginal Source Model was not originally generated from wizard inputs, eQuest doesn't permit me entering the wizards to modify the model. I only can use the "Detailed Data Edit" mode. But the changes made in "Detailed Data Edit" mode cannot be recorded by the EEM wizard. Is there any easy method to rebuild the model in wizard and correct BDL errors? 

  Thanks a lot!

  Sincerely,
  Gang Tan

Gang, I think you have a mix-up between the library file that comes with
DOE2.2 vs the one that comes with eQuest.  The library files aren't the
same, you'll have to add the materials from the one to the other.  I
believe you can do this with a text editor.  You may be able to copy the
library file from DOE2.2 to eQuest (although you'll have fewer library
choices as the eQuest one has more entries?)
 
I had done this before where I wanted to use DOE2.2 directly instead of
eQuest, so I had to copy over the eQuest library file (I forget the
exact name of the file...BDLLIB.dat or similar).  I'm not sure what to
do for you, since you may have used components out of the eQuest library
and can't simply revert to the DOE2.2 library.
 
Please make copies of all files before you modify anything!
 
As far as I know, you will have to keep using the detailed data edit
mode.  You may want to look at a tool such as "compare-it" to keep track
of two separate eQuest *.inp files.
 
Hope this helps.  And hope someone will jump in and correct me if I'm
off-base, or elaborate on the differences between library files.
 
David

 Dear All,

I am Gang. I obtained a simulation model (let's call it Original Source
Model) defined using DOE-2.2 (version 44c3). The file name is *.INP. I am
trying to modify it using eQuest3.55 since the eQuest3.55 included the
latest DOE-2.2 (version 44c3).

When I open the Original Source Model using eQuest3.55, there are ~40 errors
found in BDL. For example: "A MATERIAL property is zero or negative". I want
to correct these errors using eQuest3.55 platform. My questions are:

1. Whether is any confict between the model (*.INP) developed using general
DOE-2.2 version 44c3 with eQuest3.55? I mean, does eQuest3.55 recognize all
the BNL codes from DOE-2.2 version 44c3? Is it possible that the model
developed in DOE-2.2 version 44cs can correctly run in DOE-2.2 but not in
eQuest?

2. Since my Orginal Source Model was not originally generated from wizard
inputs, eQuest doesn't permit me entering the wizards to modify the model. I
only can use the "Detailed Data Edit" mode. But the changes made in
"Detailed Data Edit" mode cannot be recorded by the EEM wizard. Is there any
easy method to rebuild the model in wizard and correct BDL errors?

Thanks a lot!

Sincerely,
 Gang Tan

Check you have the right version of AutoCAD. I'm not sure if eQuest can
import drawings that are 2004+ - does anyone know? I know 2002 and 2000
work.

Make sure that you have traced around the building with a polyline.

If you have checked both things and you are still getting this error I'm not
sure what might be wrong. You might try the user support with eQuest, one of
the DOE2 representatives.

I am guessing you are using eQUEST.  If so, you can delete the
reference to the AutoCAD .dwg file in the .pd2 file (a text file) --
look for keyword CADFile down near the bottom.  

Hope this helps.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200604241914.AA1413187pd80001063148@gard.com>

Possibly the interpretation of what is gross wall area depends on what
version of 90.1 you are looking at.  As for 90.1-2004, the official
interpretation on the ASHRAE web site leaves no doubt that ?gross wall area?
include both above- and below-ground walls.  See the following item verbatim
from the ASHRAE web site.

 

INTERPRETATION IC 90.1-2004-1 OF ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA STANDARD 90.1-2004

Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings

 

 

Date Approved June 25, 2005

 

Request from: Roger Chang (E-mail: roger.chang at arup.com), Associate Member,
155 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10013.

 

Reference:  This request for interpretation refers to the requirements
presented in ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004, Section 5.2.1 Compliance,
relating to gross wall area.

 

Background: Standard 90.1-2004 does not appear to be clear as to what gross
wall area means. International Energy Conservation Code is clear that
prescriptive requirements are based on window to above-grade wall area. This
impacts all sections of the code where the window-to- wall area ratio is
taken into consideration.

 

 

Interpretation: Gross wall area refers to above-grade wall only.

 

 

Question:  Is this interpretation correct?

 

 

Answer:  No.

 

 

Comments:

 

Section 3.2 defines ?building envelope? to include ?the elements of a
building
that enclose...spaces through which thermal energy may be
transferred to or from the exterior?.

 

Section 3.2, in the definition of ?wall? states ?this includes above- and
below-grade walls, between floor spandrels, peripheral edges of floors, and
foundation walls?.

 

Section 3.2 defines ?gross wall area? as ?the area of the wall measured on
the exterior face from the top of the floor to the bottom of the roof?.

 

Therefore, for buildings with conditioned space below-grade, the gross wall
area extends from the top of the surface of the floor of the lowest
conditioned space to the bottom of the roof of the highest conditioned
space.

 

(Note that the use of a similar term in a document from another organization
is irrelevant to an interpretation of Standard 90.1.)

Rene, Larry and Gerald,

 

I think that the the underground wall area should be included for each floor
that has windows.  These windows in partially below ground stories are
providing light and views that are no less important than similar functions
provided on upper floors.  However, if I have a skyscraper with 4 stories of
underground garage of basement areas, I don't think these fully underground
wall areas should be included.  Rene, in evaluating the energy and cost
impacts of windows in buildings, it is important to look at the potential
for daylighting or the value of view, otherwise an engineering analysis
might conclude that we don't need any windows at all.

 

Perhaps this should be brought up with the 90.1 envelope committee.

 

Sincerely,

It depends on the code in use. 

 

I submitted an official request (CM proposal) to the ASHRAE 90.1 Envelope
committee to change the definition to only include the above grade walls but
they declined it so it is still the above and below grade walls. The reason
I sent the request is that architects tend to add more glazing to the above
grade walls because they can include the below grade walls in the
definition. I showed some modeling results of the difference between a two
story building with one above and below grade wall in a few difference
cities in the US and there was a significant energy impact.

 

However, I believe the IECC includes only the above grade walls.

Gerald et al,

 

The conventional definition of window-wall-ratio is the window area divided
by the ?gross? wall area, though the term ?window-wall-ratio? is no longer
among the Definitions section of 90.1-2004.  For that matter, WWR is not
defined in the Abbreviations section.

 

Notwithstanding all that, the definition for ?Gross Wall Area? is clearly
defined in the 90.1-2004 User?s Manual.

 

On page 5-30, example 5-G addresses ?Determining Gross Wall Area?, stating
that this is very significant since the window area requirements are based
on Window-Wall-Ratio (WWR).  

 

Answer (as shown on the same page):  ?The gross wall area includes both
above-grade walls and below-grade walls so that gross wall area is simply
the perimeter of the building 
 times the height
?

I recently came across a paper from "Building Energy

Codes Program" called "Setting the Standard" and lists

out various new code updates. It seems that currently

we are allowed to count below-grade walls as part of

the window-wall ratio calculations.  Does anyone have

an update on this or point me to the right resource to

confirm this information?

 

Thanks.

Have you tried exporting it as gem (geometry) file and then importing it 
into the new version via gem file?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Extraction of rainfall data from TMY2 weather file
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200604241729.AA295531pd80001063019@gard.com>

Hello,
I am trying to extract hourly/ daily rainfall data from a TMY2 weather
file. I have pasted the EPW file in excel, with their respective
headers. According to the documentation on EPW and TMY2 formats, the
rainfall data is in the field, "Present Weather Codes", which is a 9
digit code, the 2nd digit of which indicates rainfall values as follows:

0=Light Rain
1= Moderate Rain
2= Heavy Rain
3= Light Rain showers
4= Moderate rain showers
5= Heavy rain showers
6= Light freezing rain
7= Moderate freezing rain
8= Heavy freezing rain
9= None/ unknown/ missing

Further notes say that 
Light= up to 0.25 cm/hour
Moderate= 0.28 to 0.76 cm/ hour
Heavy= greater than 0.76 cm/ hour

I am confused with this note. Do "Light Rain" and "Light Rain showers"
mean the same amount of rain, since they are both "Light"? In other
words, is there a definition of the range of rainfall in cm/ hour
between values of 0 to 5. Do values 6, 7 and 8 mean the same amount of
rainfall as 3, 4 and 5 respectively, just with a lower temperature?

Any help with this format will be greatly appreciated.
Regards.

ABSTRACT

This paper summarizes the findings from the California statewide baseline
study of
the nonresidential new construction market. The information is developed
from qualitative
and quantitative surveys of 228 architects and engineers, together with
on-site audits and
DOE-2 models of 667 new construction projects completed from 1994 to 1998.
The DOE-2
simulations were used to measure the efficiency of the sample buildings
relative to the 1995
Title 24 California energy code. The market-actor surveys were used to
characterize market behavior and look for barriers to efficiency.

Bob,

As far as I know, IES can export in 3D DXF (or 2D DXF slices) but only 
import in 2D DXF. 2D DXF can then be extruded into 3D model provided 
that the DXF meets the basic requirement, i.e. room name exist, every 
room is a enclosed loop. I find it easier to retrace architectural 
drawing in the CAD software first and export only this layer out as DXF 
and use IES to extrude it into 3D.

I suggest the use of gbXML format to import 3D models into IES which 
works quite well.

Kind regards,

CK

Rene, Larry and Gerald,
 
I think that the the underground wall area should be included for each floor that has windows.  These windows in partially below ground stories are providing light and views that are no less important than similar functions provided on upper floors.  However, if I have a skyscraper with 4 stories of underground garage of basement areas, I don't think these fully underground wall areas should be included.  Rene, in evaluating the energy and cost impacts of windows in buildings, it is important to look at the potential for daylighting or the value of view, otherwise an engineering analysis might conclude that we don't need any windows at all.
 
Perhaps this should be brought up with the 90.1 envelope committee.
 
Sincerely,

It depends on the code in use. 

 

I submitted an official request (CM proposal) to the ASHRAE 90.1 Envelope committee to change the definition to only include the above grade walls but they declined it so it is still the above and below grade walls. The reason I sent the request is that architects tend to add more glazing to the above grade walls because they can include the below grade walls in the definition. I showed some modeling results of the difference between a two story building with one above and below grade wall in a few difference cities in the US and there was a significant energy impact.

 

However, I believe the IECC includes only the above grade walls.

Gerald et al,

 

The conventional definition of window-wall-ratio is the window area divided by the "gross" wall area, though the term "window-wall-ratio" is no longer among the Definitions section of 90.1-2004.  For that matter, WWR is not defined in the Abbreviations section.

 

Notwithstanding all that, the definition for "Gross Wall Area" is clearly defined in the 90.1-2004 User's Manual.

 

On page 5-30, example 5-G addresses "Determining Gross Wall Area", stating that this is very significant since the window area requirements are based on Window-Wall-Ratio (WWR).  

 

Answer (as shown on the same page):  "The gross wall area includes both above-grade walls and below-grade walls so that gross wall area is simply the perimeter of the building ... times the height..."

I recently came across a paper from "Building Energy

Codes Program" called "Setting the Standard" and lists

out various new code updates. It seems that currently

we are allowed to count below-grade walls as part of

the window-wall ratio calculations.  Does anyone have

an update on this or point me to the right resource to

confirm this information?

 

Thanks.

It depends on the code in use. 

 

I submitted an official request (CM proposal) to the ASHRAE 90.1 Envelope
committee to change the definition to only include the above grade walls but
they declined it so it is still the above and below grade walls. The reason
I sent the request is that architects tend to add more glazing to the above
grade walls because they can include the below grade walls in the
definition. I showed some modeling results of the difference between a two
story building with one above and below grade wall in a few difference
cities in the US and there was a significant energy impact.

 

However, I believe the IECC includes only the above grade walls.

Gerald et al,

 

The conventional definition of window-wall-ratio is the window area divided
by the ?gross? wall area, though the term ?window-wall-ratio? is no longer
among the Definitions section of 90.1-2004.  For that matter, WWR is not
defined in the Abbreviations section.

 

Notwithstanding all that, the definition for ?Gross Wall Area? is clearly
defined in the 90.1-2004 User?s Manual.

 

On page 5-30, example 5-G addresses ?Determining Gross Wall Area?, stating
that this is very significant since the window area requirements are based
on Window-Wall-Ratio (WWR).  

 

Answer (as shown on the same page):  ?The gross wall area includes both
above-grade walls and below-grade walls so that gross wall area is simply
the perimeter of the building 
 times the height
?

I recently came across a paper from "Building Energy

Codes Program" called "Setting the Standard" and lists

out various new code updates. It seems that currently

we are allowed to count below-grade walls as part of

the window-wall ratio calculations.  Does anyone have

an update on this or point me to the right resource to

confirm this information?

 

Thanks.

Morgan,

Hi all ? I'm looking at modeling a large solar chimney for pre-heating
outside air.  It's going to consist of an 8 story glazing wall set 3' or so
in front of a cement mass mall.  I'm hoping to find a simple way to
approximate the savings in eQUEST.  I'm still in the design development
phase of the project, so I don't want to spend too much time on the model.
Does anyone have any advice?  Thanks.

There is a standard interpretation on the ASHRAE website where the
committee suggests that underground surfaces of conditioned spaces are
included in the calculation, as they are part of the heat transfer
envelope.

Don't forget that your simulation will require at least 4 loops to select the number oif chillers, type of chiller, and efficiency. Similar issues are involved with the boiler DHW, pumps and fans. You can find a paper that gives some guidance on the procedure we have developed behind the Texas emissions calculator at ecalc.tamu.edu, go to the public tab under reports, and select the ICEBO paper on the commercial building. Even with this approach DOE-2's autosizing remains probnlematic when using pre-calculated weighting factors and SC/U-values for windows (versus Windows 5). Another tricky issue is the zoning, which can drift in and out of minimum VSD requirements for fans in 90.1-1999.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] LEED ECB Question - System 6 Components

I am looking for some guidance from ASHRAE 90.1 modelers.  I have a couple of projects in Chicago where the proposed system is comprised of ground loop-coupled water-to-air heat pumps.  My question is regarding compliance with ASHRAE 90.1-1999 ECB method (the projects are to be LEED v2.1 certified).  I am using eQuest v3.55.  Given that we are using the ground loop and this is a non-residential multi-zone project, I have to use the ECB Budget System 6 (constant volume Water-source heat pumps with DX cooling and boiler heating) as the Budget System.  That seems straight forward, except that I am not sure how to handle heat rejection from the condenser/DX coil on the heat pumps for a small building given the limited guidance in 90.1-1999.  
 
In most cases I would use a cooling tower for heat rejection from the condenser loop as the Budget System.  Has anyone had successfully proposed using a cooling tower/fluid cooler for  the ECB Budget System 6 for a relatively small system (less than 12 tons of cooling load) with the USGBC?  It seems like overkill to me to use cooling tower with an additional pump and head loss, and the percent of energy saved over the GLHP system reflects that.  I know that Appendix G's Budget System in my case would be a packaged HP with an air-cooled condenser for rejection.  But I want to find out if there is any precedent for the heat rejection for 90.1-1999's Budget System 6.  Any help you could give me would be great.

Dear All,



I am looking for workshop or hands on training on simulation software
eQUEST/Design Builder which will be held in Australia. In Design Builder
site, I found two tutorials which were really very helpful. But I haven't
found that sort of tutorial for eQUEST. Any of those two softwares will
serve my purpose. But to know detail usages on those softwares it is
urgently required to have a comprehensive training. I am newcomer in
building simulation field and I believe, any sort of training will help me
to build up base knowledge on building energy simulation. Can anybody in the
group have information on that? Please let me know if you have any updated
information. I look forward to receive from you soon.



Kind regards,

Ashfaque

Hi all,

 

Does anyone have any experience with modeling Skylights and/or Tubular
Daylighting Devices in eQuest?  I have a K-8 school building that will have
two TDDs in each of six classrooms, as well as four TDDs along the main
corridor.  The roof is pitched and has an unconditioned attic space, created
in Wizard Data Edit mode.  I've tried following the multiple skylight
example in the Help section, but it gets tricky when I am to create new roof
sections, etc.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

 

Thank you,

You could also try RETScreen - they have very nice simplified modules for solar hot water, PV, and oher fun stuff. It is a standalone, and you will need to do some postprocessing of your eQUEST results.

In my opinion, your tool of choice should depend on the level of analysis you feel is warranted for the project.  If you need a relatively simple analysis and don't want to spend a lot of money then I would steer you towards F-Chart (www.fchart.com).  If instead you with to study in detail the solar water heating system and its impact on the building then you may wish to consider TRNSYS.  TRNSYS has an extensive library of solar models (including PV, water heating, space heating etc.) and its flexibility allows you to configure almost any type of solar water system that you can imagine.  Let us know if you have any questions.

A minor correction - the Energy-10 Solar DHW simulation runs as a separate
hourly simulation within the Energy-10 code (the PV simulation, however,
does call EnergyPlus).  The SDHW model is based on a simple thermal
collector efficiency curve and hourly storage accounting and interacts with
the balance of the Energy-10/CNE building simulation to reduce building DHW
load only (not space heating, for example).

Energy-10 does include solar water heating
and PV but it is a stand-alone calculation similar
to the daylighting--in fact, Energy-10 runs EnergyPlus
for its SWH and PV calcs.  Energy-10 is suitable for
smaller buildings but not multizone buildings.

The best way right now to get integrated analysis is Energy10 - version
1.8 from SBIC, http://www.sbicouncil.org/.

Another approach is to use eQuest with a separate model using for the
solar water heating using FCHART, then combine the results in a
spreadsheet.

Dear John:

Thank you for your prompt response.  I have just received Energy-10 v1.8
update and it just added a domestic solar water heater module as well as
a PV calculation module.  I have not used it yet, but currently, in
class, we are simulating commercial buildings for LEED certification
and was hoping to continue using eQUEST.

What is the suggested level of funding from university?

Thank you,

Nader

Sir:

eQUEST has NO current mechanism to do solar hot water
heating. There were algorithms in DOE-2.1A back in
1981, but they have since been abandoned through the
continous upgrades.

If universities would get some funding for this
wonderful program, I am sure the eQUEST creators would
put it in a future version.

However, I have not try that with eQUEST.  It is a large percentage of

Can anyone tell me if they have used the keywords
SUPPLY-PLENUM, PLUME-COOL, PLUME-DEADBAND and
PLUME-HEAT to model displacement ventilation in
eQUEST? I am trying to determine if eQUEST recoqnizes
these functions in the BDL.

Thanks,

Hello Jay:

Of COURSE you need to separate systems that are 100%
OSA and those that recirculated. If you are using
eQUEST?DOE2 in ANY form, you would model each system
separately. Al;so, use a VAVS system with a MINUMUm
OSA = 1.0 so you use the return fans as exhaust fans.
Then apply any VAVS airfloe changes.

For example, if the airflow reduces to 40%, this
becomes 40% of total outside air.

Good luck..

Hello
  I am modeling a multipurpose building. 
  Certain zones in this building demand 100% outside air (i.e. laboratories with fumehoods)
  Can anybody give me suggestions as to how I can model such a condition?
  Would I need to model two systems, with one system dedicated to conditioning the laboratories?
  Any help / suggestions or pointers to literature/ examples would be immensly helpful.
  Thanks

Hi Ken,
I would suggest you look at several different models and their assumptions,
as evaporative loss calculations vary greatly between models. Restcreen is a
free Canadian software you can use to calculate solar water heating, that
provides pool losses calculations. This program has good written
documentation on the assumptions used.
The latest evaporative loss model, and one found to be most accurate and
flexible is the Shah model, for both occupied and unoccupied pools. The
ASHRAE equation (presented by Carrier in 1918) may overly predict losses for
pools with extensive unoccupied periods.
As for conductive losses for underground swimming pools, these may be
accounted as a percent of the other losses (radiative, convective and
evaporative). I believe Retscreen, for instance, use 5% of the total.
Conductive losses are many times ignored altogether by different simulation
models. Also, pay attention to what 'unoccupied' really means because some
models will regard the pool as being covered whenever unoccupied, and this
may or may not be the case for you.

The greatest impact on pool losses, as you can imagine will be the pool hall
maintained relative humidity and temperature, as well as pool water
temperature and activity level in the pool. Once you feel comfortable with
these assumptions, then using the Shah model may give you some good
estimates for evaporative losses.

Hope this helps.
Karen,

Ken,
  There is a TRNSYS model (written by Transsolar Energietechnik GmBH) for 
an indoor or outdoor pool. There are also extensive solar collector models 
available, both glazed and unglazed. Please let me know if you'd like to 
talk about specifics.
Cheers,

I am working on a design for a solar heating system for an olymic sized pool.

I am hoping someone has a sugesstion about software modeling tools that

Possibly something for tanks, ponds, or lake would be of help.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Hourly Report Problem.
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200604061844.AA444062pd80001043541@gard.com>

Hi all,
 
I am modeling a 31-story high rise. This building uses VAV (reverse action
thermostat type)  and two-pipe fan coil units (reverse action thermostat
type). I have tried reversed action and proportional thermostat type but
both gave me the same results. It also has a DOAS that serves 26 floors with
CFM ranging from 50 - 100 CFM. All systems are assumed to be code values.
The intention of this model is to estimate cooling load during peak
condition. I let all schedules to be the default except for lighting and
equipment schedules. These schedules are set to be always on. 
 
I ran the model and the result is 97% out of throttling range. I figured
this is because of the peak condition which the systems can't meet the
desired temperature set-points (heating 70 deg, cooling 75 deg, and 4 deg
throttling range for all systems). I ran this model and got the hourly data.
It got more interesting. From SS-D report, I gathered that on Sept 5 @ 4pm
is the peak condition for the building which is located in Portland, OR. I
pulled out hourly data for that day and plot them in excel. The curve is
nice and smooth with a couple of peaks and valleys at the beginning of the
day with a distinguished peak at 4pm. I also grabbed hourly data for winter
season. I picked 3 days ( Jan 3 is the lowest load from SS-D report). For
Jan 3rd, the curve is nice and smooth similar to Sept. 5th curve. But when I
graph Jan 6th and Jan 1st, the curves don't make sense. Both curves behave
as sinusoidal curves. They go up and down every hour of the day. I don't
understand them. Is this because of the model is out of throttling range? If
so, why on certain days and not all of them. 
 
Thank you very much for your help and suggestions in advanced. I gladly
appreciate them.

in advance of its replacement of version 3.55.  When we "officially"
release that version we will post an announcement to this list; we wiil do
that when we are comfortable that it is ready for general public release.

  David and all,

  eQuest version 3.56 vastly improves GSHP system entry. It makes it easy to set parameters for ground loop. It looks to me like no detailed entry stuff is required.  BUT...for some reason, the makers have not made version 3.56 available from the DOE2.COM web site.  Anyone know why?

  We got ours by attending a training seminar.

Thanks,
I am using eQuest 3.56, and seem to have fixed my Ground Loop Issue, my
problem appears to lie within my pump specifications within the rest of
the water-side schematic. A brief description of my system is as
follows:
- Ground Loop Heat Exchanger utilising a water loop heat pump
- 1 Heat Pump with a 2 pipe loop feeding into my heating coils and,
- 1 Heat Pump with a chilled water loop feeding into my cooling coils
 
The heating and cooling coils on my air-side schematic do reference the
correct coils and upon simulation I get the following error:
" 

***ERROR****************************************************************
*******

Loop: CHW Pump has zero design flow.

Check input for consistency, or specify design loads.

"

Once again, any help will be greatly appreciated

Hi,
    I am looking for the exact form of the equation that is used to calculate the infiltration using the Sherman-Grimsrud model used in DOE2. Though I have found the equation in the ASHRAE handbook I am not sure how the HORIZONTAL-LEAK-FRACTION and the NEUTRAL-LEVEL are used in the equation. Though the Engineers manual provides the equation for CRACK method it does not seem to provide the equations for the Sherman-Grimsrud model.

Could anyone please give me additional information about this equation.

Thanks,

Please excuse cross-postings.

DesignBuilder V 1.1 - New User Interface for EnergyPlus

DesignBuilder Version 1.1 is an exciting new user interface for
EnergyPlus.  Based around our innovative OpenGL modelling tool,
it allows even inexperienced users to access EnergyPlus' most
powerful features:

-  Provides most commonly used HVAC systems including VAV
   with terminal reheat with options for VAV box and outside
   air control, constant volume, DX unitary systems, packaged
   rooftop systems, fan coil units, hot water radiators and
   underfloor heating.

-  Detailed simulation of air flow through cracks and openings
   from wind and buoyancy effects.  You can control window/vent
   opening using timers and thermostats.

-  All significant EnergyPlus fabric, glazing, shading, natural
   ventilation and daylight control features are implemented.

-  Also: shading and reflection from architectural features;
   electrochromic glazing; transparent insulation; free cooling;
   night cooling; glazed cavities such as double facades and
   Trombe walls etc.

Simulation data can be shown in annual, monthly, daily, hourly
or sub-hourly intervals:

-  Energy consumption broken down by fuel and end-use.
-  Heat input from heating and cooling coils.
-  Internal air, mean radiant and operative temperatures and humidity
-  Comfort output including temperature distribution curves,
   ASHRAE 55 comfort criteria, Fanger PMV, Pierce PMV ET,
   Pierce PMV SET, Pierce Discomfort Index (DISC), Pierce Thermal
   Sens. Index (TSENS), Kansas Uni TSV.
-  Site weather data
-  Heat transmission through building fabric including walls, roofs,
   infiltration, ventilation etc.
-  Heating and cooling loads.
-  CO2 generation.

The DesignBuilder user interface is the result of a considerable
development effort over the last seven years.  It has been designed
from the ground up to be easy to use while retaining the flexibility
to allow just about any building to be modelled.  The most important
interface features are:

-  OpenGL building modeller allows building models to be assembled by
   positioning 'blocks' in 3-D space.  Blocks can be cut, moved and
   stretched allowing you to work with just about any geometry.
-  Easily generate stunning rendered images and movies of your building
   design including the effect of site shading for any day of the year.
   Explore the model using simple view controls.
-  Data templates allow you to load common building constructions,
   activities, HVAC & lighting systems into your design by selecting
   from drop-down lists. You can also add your own templates if you
   often work on similar types of buildings.
-  Data inheritance allows global changes to be made at building,
   block or zone level. This doesn't sound very impressive but it is
   the underlying basis for DesignBuilders' flexibility and ease of use!
-  Control the level of detail in each building model allowing the tool
   to be used effectively at any stage of the design or evaluation process.
-  Switch between Model Edit View and Environmental performance data with
   a single click - data is displayed without the need to run external
   modules and import data - any simulations required to generate the
   data are started automatically.
-  Building geometry can be imported from CAD data and traced over
   within DesignBuilder to create blocks and to partition blocks up into
   zones.
-  Export IDF files and work with them outside DesignBuilder to access
   system functionality not provided by DesignBuilder.
-  Heating and cooling plant sizes can be calculated using design weather
   data.
-  ASHRAE worldwide design weather data and locations (4429 data sets) are
   included.
-  Latest EnergyPlus hourly weather files are available (1258 data sets)
   free using the DesignBuilder 'Install on Demand' feature.

Cost:

The price for DesignBuilder version 1 is 1449 USD which includes EnergyPlus
and Visualisation modules, all version 1.x updates and priority e-mail
support.
You can find out more about the various licensing options from the website:

http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/

Future:

We have exciting plans for future versions of DesignBuilder.  Once the
Version 1.x feature set is complete (summer 2006) we plan to start
developing a detailed HVAC system modeller, a CFD simulation capability
and advanced data management and reporting functions.  We are currently
testing our UK Part-L building regulations compliance modules and will
start work very soon on providing certified building regulations compliance
reports for Australia and New Zealand. We also expect to provide LEED
reports later in the year.

You can find out more about DesignBuilder from our web site:

http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/products

You can also download a free 30-day evaluation version of the software.
And if you have downloaded DesignBuilder in the past and would like us
to extend your evaluation please contact me.

Let me know if you need any further information about the software.
We look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQUEST - Cogen for DHW
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200604031930.AA303715pd80001040172@gard.com>

I am trying to model a Cogeneration system (gas turbine generator) in
eQuest that recovers thermal energy for domestic hot water.  I connected
the generator to my domestic hot water loop, and set the tracking mode
to thermal tracking.

I am having 2 problems with this setup.  First, when I run the model,
using a cogen system has no effect on the metered electricity
consumption.  The gas consumption increased and is going towards meeting
electric demands such as lighting, but the electricity consumption is
not decreasing.  In the output files, there is a negative kWh number for
the cogen, but this doesn't seem to be translating to the electricity
meters and utility costs.  

Second, I cannot create an equipment control strategy with the Domestic
Hot Water Heater and the Electric Generator.  If I create an equipment
control for DHW heating, it only accepts primary domestic hot water
equipment - it does not allow you to sequence an electric generator.

If any has any suggestions, I would appreciate it!

Thank you,

Kendra

Hi all,

 

Does anyone have any experience with exporting eQuest project geometries
into Radiance?  I'm trying to determine what file extensions eQuest uses to
save the geometry of a project created in eQuest, and if these files can
then be imported into Radiance for daylighting analysis.  I'm also trying to
find similar information for DesignBuilder.

PVFCHART and DOE-2 can be used in combination. There's a PhD thesis on this by Keith Sylvester at Texas A&M. It shows you actually save more $ on the cooling reduction from the shade from the BIPV than the electricity generated.

Scott,
You could either use the DOE2 glass library with different glass types (there's an XL file somwhere that lists the glazing numbers by SHGC, U value & VT)  by , or import data from LBNL's Window 5.2 
 
Personally I prefer to use Window 5.2 because it allows me to model the exact glazing from the manufacturer database in Window 5.2.

I modeled my entire building and did extra tweaks in the detailed edit mode. I've just been informed that the contractor installed different glass than what was specified, so they are going to keep it.

 

How do I change glass type from say ?"double pane with air gap to ?" double pane with argon gap and not allow it to erase all of my detailed edit work? I know I have this option at the beginning in the wizard.

 

When I look at glass types and right click for properties, on the left side of the screen, it is not descriptive at all. I just see some numbers for the various properties. 

 

Thanks again for your help.

Scott:

What type of system are you using? Do you have a
reheat that is electric or gas?

I am willing to bet there is a control phenomena
happening.

Are you SURE you are using the same glass, too??

Dear Scott:
Without looking at your model inputs, I wonder if your model may be in a heating dominated climate.
Overhangs can reduce your cooling load, but the heating load may be increased as a result of the added shading during winter.
If the heating load increase overshadows the cooling load savings from that measure, the net energy consumption may increase.

I hope this helps.

My building is located in South Carolina. I have compared the simulation
before and after the overhangs have been added.

 

With the overhangs: Electrically: Space Cooling, Heat Rejection, Space
Heating (this makes sense), and Pumps increase while the Vent. Fan
energy consumption decreases.

 

Gas Consumption increases for Space Heating.

 

Even when I am looking at this on a cooling basis alone, adding the
overhangs increases my electric consumption during the hotter, summer
months.

 

 

I am baffled.

Thanks,

Scott Runyon

Hello all,
   
  Please excuse my very elementary knowledge and experience with e-quest. I am in the process of teaching myself how to use it. 
   
  Here is my question:
   
  I can specify a certain percentage window floor to floor (IE 40%). Then I can use the custom window door placement button and change the window size and placement characteristics, but this does not change the %Window floor to floor value. It seems to me that if I make the windows taller in this customize window door placement wizard it would affect the % values, but it does not. Which takes precedence when the actual simulation is done. The % values on the exterior window screen or the customized values?
   
  Thanks,

Matthew,
 
ESP-r has three PV models - a simple efficiency based model and two
one-diode equivalent models. Of the latter, one was developed by
(Kelly,1998) and the other, implemented by Natural Resources Canada,
based on the WATSUN-PV model. You can find information on Kelly's PV
model on the ESRU web site: http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/ (see
Publications; Kelly's PhD thesis is a good starting point). A validation
of both of ESP-r's one-diode equivalent models is currently underway and
results are to be published soon.

Scott,

 

I think the easiest (fastest) way to change the glass is to edit .inp file.
Form your email it appears that you used Glass-Type code method .For
example, you can just change the code = 2004 (air gap) to code = 2005 (argon
gap). Toy can see the Glass type description in  BDLLIB.dat.  You can employ
the same strategy if you used different method of glazing specification.

 

 

$ ---------------------------------------------------------

$              Glass Types

$ ---------------------------------------------------------

 

"Window Type #1 GT" = GLASS-TYPE      

   TYPE             = GLASS-TYPE-CODE

   GLASS-TYPE-CODE  = "2004"

   ..

"Window Type #2 GT" = GLASS-TYPE      

   TYPE             = GLASS-TYPE-CODE

   GLASS-TYPE-CODE  = "2005"

 

 

 

I hope it helps..

I modeled my entire building and did extra tweaks in the detailed edit mode.
I?ve just been informed that the contractor installed different glass than
what was specified, so they are going to keep it.

 

How do I change glass type from say ??double pane with air gap to ?? double
pane with argon gap and not allow it to erase all of my detailed edit work?
I know I have this option at the beginning in the wizard.

 

When I look at glass types and right click for properties, on the left side
of the screen, it is not descriptive at all. I just see some numbers for the
various properties. 

 

Thanks again for your help.

Dear all,

I sent an earlier email via yahoo but it was rejected because it from a 
yahoo acct. I attached the mail here again, see below..

Btw, Bob, the software flaky issue is probably true for most of these 
types of software, especially new developments. I encountered many 
crashes too...in my 10+ years playing around with these type of 
softwares. ... with ecotect, designbuilder, etc. But since 5 years ago, 
ies has cleared all these problems. One can hardly crash the program now.

Give it a try if you have the budget.

Regards,

CK Tang

John,

I have been using VE for almost 10 years now.

Its interface is very similar to esp-r, except that it runs on windows 
and easier to learn. The 3D modeling tool is ok to use, not as easy as 
ecotect or designbuilder. but the advantage is that is very stable since 
it has been developed based on esp-r modeler and it has been running on 
windows for more than 10 years now. It still have a few quirks 
sometimes... but never a real problem, allowing me to model fairly 
complex shapes in 3D that would normally impress my clients.

The thermal simulation engine was originally Apache from Oscar Faber, uk 
(i think), but have since been heavily upgraded and it is pretty 
impressive now with ability to study direct & diffuse shading  of any 
shape and tracking of solar gain into multiple zones, just model it in 
3D. There is no limit on vertices and zones. Outputs are easy to manage 
with ability to compare various factors at the same time to understand 
the physics of heat flow easily. It also incorporated the zonal airflow 
of esp called macroflo into it now for natural and hybrid ventilatino 
study. Outputs from thermal simulation can be exported out as boundary 
condition for CFD studies.

The CFD engine is only steady state at this moment, but easy enough for 
almost any engineer to use because it defaulted many values, therefore, 
only allow CFD studies in building only and only with rectangular grids.

The dayligthing and lighting simulation is done via radiance engine. 
they have provided a nice interface to radiance, thanks to Don Stearn 
that work on the original interface between esp-r and radiance more than 
10-15 years ago. It is easy to do radiance simulation now with iesve.

The air side plant modeling is very good. easy to model direct or 
indirect evaporation, heat recovery wheel, CAV, VAV and any other type 
of control system. However, the chiller and condenser part of the plant 
system is only represented via a COP curve that you provide. Adequate 
for most, but those that want to test out effectiveness of VSD on the 
condenser side will find it difficult to model it in ies (i think).

Unfortunately it is a commercial software by a commercial company... so 
it may cost a fair bit to get all the modules from IESVE compared to 
those free and almost free tools such as e+, equest, radiance, adeline 
etc. But I do think they are the market leader now for a comprehensive 
and yet easy enough to use software in building thermal simulation.

Energy+ with a good interface will probably be a good alternative too. 
Look around.

btw, if not mistaken, esp-r birthplace is scotland too, from ESRU of 
University Strathclyde. this explain the close resemblence between esp-r 
and iesve.


Kind regards,

CK Tang

EnergyPlus also has numerous options for modeling PV systems.  There are three models for PV output: simple fixed efficiency,  equivalent one-diode (TRNSYS/Otterbien model), and the King empirical model from Sandia Nat. Lab.    For BIPV, you can set up the PV modules to be tightly coupled with the Heat Balance Model's  treatment of surface heat transfer.  There is also a model for when the panels are suspended slightly from the surface to form a ventilated cavity between them and the exterior envelope.   The only BIPV/T available right now combines with solar ventilation preheat using transpired collectors, however a fuller complement of PVT models is planned for next year.  Right now you can only do grid-tied systems.  Energy-10 version 1.8 is using EnergyPlus for PV with the Sandia/King model.

I tend to agree with Vikram and Renee about simulating PV with eQuest.
I have done several simulations using just TMY data and gotten results
that closely match the 5 year annual average electric PV generated by
existing systems here in Western Massachusetts.

We have purchased the IES software and are extremely happy with the
program and the results. The motor by the way is ESP developed by Joe
Clarke and Don MacClean. For real buildings of 200,000 sf and up it does
everything a mechanical design engineer could wish for and some more.
The results are clear and concise, very user friendly.

Matthew,
   There have recently been written some new components for TRNSYS that 
deal specifically with BIPV, BIPV/T, and BIPV with an embedded phase change 
material. There are many tools available for simulating the electricity 
production of PVs but far fewer, in my experience, that can couple the PV 
with the building skin or that can look at the effects of a working fluid 
used to recuperate thermal energy from PV arrays. If you are interested in 
the models that we developed for TRNSYS, you can get some more information 
at http://www.trnsys.com by following the "TESS Component Libraries" link 
and by looking at the description of the Green Building Library. The PV/PCM 
component is not in there yet as we are in the final stages of documenting 
and releasing that model.
Cheers,
  David

More or less a complete suite of building sim software from 3D  
modelling and visualisation, energy, solar gain, HVAC design,  
lighting design, evacuation, CFD.
See www.iesve.com. Documentation is good. Software is quite expensive  
to buy esp the CFD. I don't like the interface, but maybe I'm not  
clued up enough on the subject(s). Also, to my mind, the software is  
flaky - it can create models in one module that others will crash on  
and not tell you why. It may be the best there is.... For thermal  
sim, EDSL TAS is better, but doesn't have all the other modules.

Hi Folks:

I have just been made aware of IESVE software from a
company in Scotland. It appears to do a bit of
everything, from energy analysis to 3-D CFD to
daylighting in 3-D rendering. Does anyone have a good
handle on what this stuff actually is?

eQuest results for photovoltaics seem to be pretty good and includes a
little bit of demand savings as well. There are two ways to do the
calculations - one is relatively straight forward if you have panel and
inverter specifications and the other is a Sandia calculation method which
looks more complicated.

RetScreen has a really easy to use PV program. I think eQUEST is pretty good
too. Energy 10 v1.8 is supposed to have one, though I must admi I have not
used it yet.

Kendra,
 
Without seeing your model I can only guess at what is going on.  I am
assuming you are using the add-on preconditioner and not the system type
EVAP-COOL. 
 
Most likely you have not properly defined keywords EVAP-CL-AIR and
EVAP-CL-LIMIT-T.  The default for EVAP-CL-AIR is the minimum OA ratio
(low airflow may explain the poor indirect cooling results).  You must
also be careful because the air-side economizer will also effect how the
indirect/direct add-on will operate.
 
I suggest you review the eQuest documentation which should help explain
how the system is intended to work.  You can find the Direct/Indirect
keyword explanations in the "Vol 2.-Dictionary" documentation file.
Check under HVAC System - Ventilation after the keywords for ERV heat
recovery
 
Good luck
 
Mike

Report
	
	

	I am trying to model an indirect evaporative cooler in eQuest,
and am encountering a the following problem.

	No space cooling energy is being shown in the BEPS report for my
indirect evap coolers - in fact, there is no change in any of my end use
categories!  If I change the type to Direct, then the report shows space
cooling savings, and increased fan energy (from added pressure drop) as
expected.  

	I looked in the supplemental Evap. Cooling report that DOE-2
provides, and this report shows a total cooling energy of about 1,000
MBtu for the indirect case.  A very small amount of electric energy is
being consumed by the pump, but not nearly enough to offset the cooling
savings.  This report also shows that the indirect evap. cooler is
operating for about 6000 hrs/yr (location is Las Vegas) - with this
runtime, it seems impossible that the there is no change in any end use
categories in the BEPS report!

	I also printed hourly reports for the electric power and total
cooling of the indirect evaporative cooler, and these reports indicate
that the evap. cooler is running and performing cooling.

	Does anyone know why this cooling is not appearing in the main
DOE-2 reports, such as BEPS (or the reports that come up in eQuest)?  I
don't understand why the reports account for direct evaporative cooling,
but not indirect.  

	Thank you in advance!

Gerald, 

I am not sure I understand your question, but I will take a shot at answering. Appendix G is different from the body of the standard. Chapter 5 prescribes maximum fenestration areas as a % of gross wall area which includes below grade walls. Appendix G, in describing the hypothetical baseline building prescribes a maximum fenestration area as a percentage of above grade wall area. These two sections are clearly different.

Michael, 
Appendix-g states that use 40% glazing if glazing % is 
above 40%, otherwise use whatever is smaller. From all 
the discussions regarding this above-grade/below-grade 
issue, we now learn that, as an update to the code, 
below grade walls(if the adjecent space is 
conditioned) are now included in the WWR calculations. 
Appendix-g should not change anything apart from the 
fact that glazing will need to be equally distributed 
through-out the above-grade facade, am I correct?

Michael,
Appendix-g states that use 40% glazing if glazing % is
above 40%, otherwise use whatever is smaller. From all
the discussions regarding this above-grade/below-grade
issue, we now learn that, as an update to the code,
below grade walls(if the adjecent space is
conditioned) are now included in the WWR calculations.
Appendix-g should not change anything apart from the
fact that glazing will need to be equally distributed
through-out the above-grade facade, am I correct?

Can anyone tell me if the daylighting routine in eQUEST / DOE-2.2
takes skylights into account or whether it only accounts for  exterior
wall windows?

Many thanks.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] EnergyPlus V1.3.0 Now Available
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200604251607.AA0750875pd80001064526@gard.com>

EnergyPlus Version 1.3.0 Now Available

The tenth major version of EnergyPlus (1.3.0) was 
released on April 21, 2006 and is now available 
in versions for both the Windows and Linux 
operating systems.  Download this newest release 
at no cost from the EnergyPlus web site: 
<http://www.energyplus.gov/>www.energyplus.gov.

What's New in Version 1.3.0?

A few of the new features in EnergyPlus V 1.3 are 
listed below?see 
<http://www.energyplus.gov/features.html>www.energyplus.gov/features.html 
for a complete list of new features added in this and previous versions:

    * UFAD (Under Floor Air Distribution) room 
air model for exterior zones is now available.
    * Completely reworked airflow modeling?the 
new AirflowNetwork model replaces both COMIS and 
ADS and has the combined 
capabilities.  Calculation of infiltration, 
ventilation, mixing and cross mixing moved to 
system time step for future feature development 
of hybrid (mixed mode) ventilation control. 
Differences in results are usually minor.
    * Outside air temperature is now varied as a 
function of zone or surface height above 
ground.  Wind profile options can be set 
separately for the weather station and the 
building site.  Includes new zone and surface 
report variables for height dependent properties. 
There will be differences in results, 
particularly in files with Ventilation or Infiltration.
    * Simple earth tube model for preconditioning 
(heating/cooling) outside air.
    * Tempering valve (3-way valve emulation) for 
effective and safe use of stored thermal energy.
    * Variable and constant speed headered pumps.
    * Detailed ice storage.
    * New Compact HVAC models for fan powered 
VAV, fan coil, night cycle controls, outside air 
heat recovery, supply air temperature reset, 
chilled/hot water temperature reset, VAV supply 
fan part-load options, VAV fan blow through or 
draw through option, and zone supply and return plenums.
    * Energy end-use subcategories are now user-definable.
    * New report variable for Zone Operative 
Temperature (Operative Temperature Control planned for V 1.4 in October).

And many other enhancements and significant speed improvements throughout.


Update on User Interfaces?

Several interfaces and utilities for EnergyPlus 
are now available.  EP-Quick creates an 
EnergyPlus input file based on a broad range of 
zone templates.  EP-Quick was released in April 
2005.  E2AC is an interface in Portuguese and 
English available since January 2005 (more 
languages are planned).  DesignBuilder, a graphic 
user interface, was released in December 
2005.  EFEN is now available in beta version for 
users to test.  Green Building Studio can take an 
existing CAD file and convert to an EnergyPlus 
input file. Several other interfaces are under 
development.  Watch our web site 
(<http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_interfaces.html>www.energyplus.gov/ep_interfaces.html) 
for up-to-date information on these and other interfaces.

A number of utilities and tools for creating, 
editing, and running input files come with 
EnergyPlus, including IDF Editor, EP-Launch, and 
HVAC-Diagram (see 
<http://www.energyplus.gov/ep_utilities.html>www.energyplus.gov/ep_utilities.html). 
Third party tools for creating, editing, and 
displaying EnergyPlus input files are also 
available, including DrawBDL, EcoTect,  ESP-r, 
Green Building Studio, EzDrawPlus, IFCtoIDF, 
TSe+, and EzPlus-Parm.  See 
<http://www.energyplus.gov/third_party_tools.html>www.energyplus.gov/third_party_tools.html 
for more information.

What?s going on in V1.3.0?

Will there be any considerable difference between version 1.3.0 and 1.2.3?

Yes.... and no. There are a number of new features and bug fixes.

How about IDF and IDD? Do they remain unchanged?

There are some changes in the IDD that are 
reflected in IDFs. Particularly for any new

Is version 1.3.0 backward compatible? Can I run a v1.2.3 file in v 1.3.0?

For the most part, the answer is yes. There are 
many changes that require you to transition to 
V1.3.0. EP-Launch will now check the selected 
file (if there is a version object) and you can 
launch the Transition program from the EP-Launch 
?File? menu.  You can also view the ObjectStatus 
spreadsheet in the root folder of the installed 
version. This file has detailed explanations of changes to the objects.
This is particularly important for existing input 
files with COMIS objects ? they are both 
internally and externally transitioned but will 
not be internally transitioned in the next 
release.  If you have both COMIS and ADS objects 
in your input file ? please contact email support 
(<mailto:EnergyPlus-Support at gard.com>EnergyPlus-Support at gard.com) 
for assistance.

Since many of you readers are using Appendix G of Standard 90.1 for modeling LEED rated buildings you should be aware that Table G.3.1.5 states in the description of the baseline building for WWR;

 " Vertical fenestration areas for new buildings and additions shall equal that in the proposed design or 40% of gross above grade wall area, whichever is smaller, and shall be distributed uniformly in horizontal bands across the four orientations."

As for the last part of that requirement, distributing fenestration uniformly in horizontal bands across the four orientations, that has been removed in Addendum A to the 2004 Standard, but will not be updated in the published version until 2007.

Possibly the interpretation of what is gross wall area depends on what
version of 90.1 you are looking at.  As for 90.1-2004, the official
interpretation on the ASHRAE web site leaves no doubt that "gross wall area"
include both above- and below-ground walls.  See the following item verbatim
from the ASHRAE web site.

 

INTERPRETATION IC 90.1-2004-1 OF ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA STANDARD 90.1-2004

Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings

 

 

Date Approved June 25, 2005

 

Request from: Roger Chang (E-mail: roger.chang at arup.com), Associate Member,
155 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10013.

 

Reference:  This request for interpretation refers to the requirements
presented in ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004, Section 5.2.1 Compliance,
relating to gross wall area.

 

Background: Standard 90.1-2004 does not appear to be clear as to what gross
wall area means. International Energy Conservation Code is clear that
prescriptive requirements are based on window to above-grade wall area. This
impacts all sections of the code where the window-to- wall area ratio is
taken into consideration.

 

 

Interpretation: Gross wall area refers to above-grade wall only.

 

 

Question:  Is this interpretation correct?

 

 

Answer:  No.

 

 

Comments:

 

Section 3.2 defines "building envelope" to include "the elements of a
building*that enclose...spaces through which thermal energy may be
transferred to or from the exterior".

 

Section 3.2, in the definition of "wall" states "this includes above- and
below-grade walls, between floor spandrels, peripheral edges of floors, and
foundation walls".

 

Section 3.2 defines "gross wall area" as "the area of the wall measured on
the exterior face from the top of the floor to the bottom of the roof".

 

Therefore, for buildings with conditioned space below-grade, the gross wall
area extends from the top of the surface of the floor of the lowest
conditioned space to the bottom of the roof of the highest conditioned
space.

 

(Note that the use of a similar term in a document from another organization
is irrelevant to an interpretation of Standard 90.1.)

Rene, Larry and Gerald,

 

I think that the the underground wall area should be included for each floor
that has windows.  These windows in partially below ground stories are
providing light and views that are no less important than similar functions
provided on upper floors.  However, if I have a skyscraper with 4 stories of
underground garage of basement areas, I don't think these fully underground
wall areas should be included.  Rene, in evaluating the energy and cost
impacts of windows in buildings, it is important to look at the potential
for daylighting or the value of view, otherwise an engineering analysis
might conclude that we don't need any windows at all.

 

Perhaps this should be brought up with the 90.1 envelope committee.

It depends on the code in use. 

 

I submitted an official request (CM proposal) to the ASHRAE 90.1 Envelope
committee to change the definition to only include the above grade walls but
they declined it so it is still the above and below grade walls. The reason
I sent the request is that architects tend to add more glazing to the above
grade walls because they can include the below grade walls in the
definition. I showed some modeling results of the difference between a two
story building with one above and below grade wall in a few difference
cities in the US and there was a significant energy impact.

 

However, I believe the IECC includes only the above grade walls.

Gerald et al,

 

The conventional definition of window-wall-ratio is the window area divided
by the "gross" wall area, though the term "window-wall-ratio" is no longer
among the Definitions section of 90.1-2004.  For that matter, WWR is not
defined in the Abbreviations section.

 

Notwithstanding all that, the definition for "Gross Wall Area" is clearly
defined in the 90.1-2004 User's Manual.

 

On page 5-30, example 5-G addresses "Determining Gross Wall Area", stating
that this is very significant since the window area requirements are based
on Window-Wall-Ratio (WWR).  

 

Answer (as shown on the same page):  "The gross wall area includes both
above-grade walls and below-grade walls so that gross wall area is simply
the perimeter of the building * times the height*"

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Need help on eQuest - library entries
References: <MDAEMON-F200604251113.AA1338625pd80001654920@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200604251327.AA2750156pd80001064329@gard.com>

DOE-2.2, used either stand-alone or in eQUEST, has two libraries:
one is the DOE-2.2 default library (called BDLLIB.dat) and the
other is the "user" library.  For stand-alone DOE-2.2 the user library
is called USRLIB.dat and comes mostly empty.  In eQUEST, the
user library is set to reference eQ_Lib.dat which contains all the
wizard and other eQUEST referenced default entries.

When using either stand-alone DOE-2.2 or eQUEST we advise against
changing BDLLIB.dat.  Using stand-alone DOE-2.2 all user entries are best placed
into USRLIB.dat and then when you send an .inp file to someone you need
to also send the usrlib.dat entries that are referenced by the BDL input
file.  When running an eQUEST generated BDL file in stand-alone DOE-2.2
it will be necessary to copy eQ_Lib.dat into USRLIB.dat if the wizard was used
to generate the input or non-DOE-2.2 defaults entries were fetched from the
detail mode.  If the DOE-2.2 USRLIB.dat has entries that are also needed
it will be necessary to make a new library by combining the two files (easy
with a text editor.)

The input file you are using probably has references to user added entries to
either the BDLLIB.dat or USRLIB.dat ... you need the other person to send you
those entries that can then be added to the end of eQ_Lib.dat (making a backup
first)  Note that releases of eQUEST frequently include altered eQ_Lib.dat files
and releases of DOE-2.2 (and thus eQUEST) sometimes contain altered versions
of BDLLIB.dat ... so care mush be taken when adding your own entries to ensure
that you don't use duplicate names of DOE-2/eQUEST entries and that you don't
replace files containing your entries when installing updates.

Note that DOE-2 searches libraries sequentially from beginning to end starting with
the user library then the bdllib; so if duplicate names exist, the first one found will be used.
Thus, user library entries can "replace" DOE-2 default ... which can be very dangerous
and produce bad results.

  Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Need help on eQuest


  Dear All,

  I am Gang. I obtained a simulation model (let's call it Original Source Model) defined using DOE-2.2 (version 44c3). The file name is *.INP. I am trying to modify it using eQuest3.55 since the eQuest3.55 included the latest DOE-2.2 (version 44c3).

  When I open the Original Source Model using eQuest3.55, there are ~40 errors found in BDL. For example: "A MATERIAL property is zero or negative". I want to correct these errors using eQuest3.55 platform. My questions are: 

  1. Whether is any confict between the model (*.INP) developed using general DOE-2.2 version 44c3 with eQuest3.55? I mean, does eQuest3.55 recognize all the BNL codes from DOE-2.2 version 44c3? Is it possible that the model developed in DOE-2.2 version 44cs can correctly run in DOE-2.2 but not in eQuest?

  2. Since my Orginal Source Model was not originally generated from wizard inputs, eQuest doesn't permit me entering the wizards to modify the model. I only can use the "Detailed Data Edit" mode. But the changes made in "Detailed Data Edit" mode cannot be recorded by the EEM wizard. Is there any easy method to rebuild the model in wizard and correct BDL errors? 

  Thanks a lot!

  Sincerely,
  Gang Tan

Gang, I think you have a mix-up between the library file that comes with
DOE2.2 vs the one that comes with eQuest.  The library files aren't the
same, you'll have to add the materials from the one to the other.  I
believe you can do this with a text editor.  You may be able to copy the
library file from DOE2.2 to eQuest (although you'll have fewer library
choices as the eQuest one has more entries?)
 
I had done this before where I wanted to use DOE2.2 directly instead of
eQuest, so I had to copy over the eQuest library file (I forget the
exact name of the file...BDLLIB.dat or similar).  I'm not sure what to
do for you, since you may have used components out of the eQuest library
and can't simply revert to the DOE2.2 library.
 
Please make copies of all files before you modify anything!
 
As far as I know, you will have to keep using the detailed data edit
mode.  You may want to look at a tool such as "compare-it" to keep track
of two separate eQuest *.inp files.
 
Hope this helps.  And hope someone will jump in and correct me if I'm
off-base, or elaborate on the differences between library files.
 
David

Check you have the right version of AutoCAD. I'm not sure if eQuest can
import drawings that are 2004+ - does anyone know? I know 2002 and 2000
work.

Make sure that you have traced around the building with a polyline.

If you have checked both things and you are still getting this error I'm not
sure what might be wrong. You might try the user support with eQuest, one of
the DOE2 representatives.

I am guessing you are using eQUEST.  If so, you can delete the
reference to the AutoCAD .dwg file in the .pd2 file (a text file) --
look for keyword CADFile down near the bottom.  

Hope this helps.

Dear All:

Here is another important question that I can't find an explanation
for:

"When I open an existing project that I created using an existing
AutoCAD drawing, it always says that the drawing isn't found and do I
want to browse for a replacement.  It says this even when I have not
moved the original drawing and when I have already re-linked it by
browsing for a replacment.  Do you know what I can do to stop this
from
happening?"

Can someone help with this matter?????

Thank you

Yes. It causes the GEM import to crash!
