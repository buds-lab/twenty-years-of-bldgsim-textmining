Subject: [Bldg-sim] System sized by "block" or "peak"?
Message-ID: <1209626696.481970483641b@webmail.vt.edu>

Hi -
How great the difference could be if a system is sized by "block" compaired to
being sized by "peak" in Trace? If "sized by peak" means sizing the system
based on peak load, what about "sized by block"? For LEED credit application, I
thought that it is not right to size an AHU by "block" in the design case while
size it by "peak" in the baseline.

Thanks!

Ying

There can be a large difference but depends on your particular building.
For example, buildings with lots of glass on the east and west.  The cooling
loads in these individual spaces may be quite large, but the east has a high
cooling load in the morning while the west has a high cooling load in the
afternoon/evening.  My understanding for LEED is that the design case
systems are sized as in the design documents.  This provides punishment for
system inefficiency due to oversizing.

In Detailed Mode, choose Utility & Economics --> Electric Meters in the
component tree --> EM1 (double click) --> Direct Loads.

You can create a new schedule for the process loads.

Message-ID: <582212.63180.qm@web45112.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

Hi Ying
Sizing by peak and by block is a function of the system type you are selecting.
Typically, you should not change this field and let it default based on the system type you have selected on the first tab in?Create Systems in Trace.
"Peak" means the system is sized based on the sum of the peak cfms in each space.? This is typically used/the default for any constant volume system.
"Block" means that the system is sized based on the peak time in which the building as a whole peaks.??? (For example: if you building's peak load occurs at 3pm, then the block load is equal to the sum of the cfms to each space at 3pm).? This is typicaly used/the default for any variable volume system.
It should be legitimate for these to vary between the base case model and proposed model as long as the sizing method is consistent with the system types that are being used for each?model.??For example: if you are using a VAV system for you proposed model, then the system sizing should be?"block".? But, if ASHRAE 90.1 dictates that you use say a PTAC system or a constant volume system in the base case model based on you your bldg size etc, then the base case system sizing should be?"peak".
As a side note....a rule of thumb for?real life use....depending on your building, there is usually/should be anywhere from a 10% to 25% difference between a system's size when sized on block versus peak? (with the block method giving you the smaller size).? If the difference is outside of this range, then you may need to check some inputs and make sure things are correct.
Julia

Message-ID: <481A0D16.8060302@gard.com>

NREL Releases Updated Typical Meteorological Year Data Set
May 1, 2008

The U.S. Department of Energy?s National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory (NREL) today released an updated typical 
meteorological year (TMY) data set derived from the 
1991-2005 National Solar Radiation Data Base update. The 
TMY3 data and user?s manual are available at

http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3

The new data sets update and expand the TMY2 data sets 
released by NREL in 1994. The TMY3 data sets provide greater 
geographical coverage than previous TMY sets with 
information on 1,020 locations in the United States, project 
leader Steve Wilcox said. Only 239 locations were listed in 
the TMY2 data set.

A TMY data set contains typical meteorological values for 
specific locations. TMY data sets are widely used by 
building designers and others for modeling renewable energy 
conversion systems. Although not designed to show 
meteorological extremes, TMY data sets hold hourly values of 
solar radiation and meteorological elements for a one-year 
period that typify climate based on a much longer period of 
time.

Unless they are revised, computer programs designed for 
previous TMY data sets will not work with TMY3 data. NREL 
provides a software utility that allows reformatting of the 
TMY3 data to the TMY2 format at the TMY3 link above.

The TMY3 data sets and the users manual were produced by 
NREL's Electric and Systems Center under the Solar Resource 
Characterization Project, which is funded and monitored by 
DOE?s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Office.

NREL is the U.S. Department of Energy's primary national 
laboratory for renewable energy and energy efficiency 
research and development. NREL is operated for DOE by 
Midwest Research Institute and Battelle.

Message-ID: <NHBBKKEOILMALGFEDDEBKEFJFBAA.kevin@warren-energy.com>

Helpful Colleagues -

I think I discovered a bug in eQUEST 3.61e last night. We are modeling a
combined High School and Middle School. There are several loops - a pair of
2-pipe loops and a pair of CHW-only loops. Some of the interior air handlers
and univents use a CHW-only loop for cooling and a 2-pipe loop for heating.
When we did this, the dedicated CHW loops show 0 flow and the chillers
associated with those loops had no kWh use. When this happens and you have
loops sizing set to primary, you get bad results; but if you change loop
sizing to secondary, then the simulation won't even run.

I tried changing the AHU system types, moving them off the loop then back
on, checked loop availability, etc. Finally I checked the bug fix document
for 3.61b and saw mention of a bug when a 2-pipe loop is used for heating.
When you use a 2-pipe for heating, eQUEST seems to mess up the cooling coil.
I created new dedicated HW loops so that my CHW coils were now teamed with
heating from a HW-only loop. That did it. It works now, and I think its just
about equivalent thermodynamically.

I hope that helps someone. If this has been posted already, I apologize.

Dear colleagues:

I'm currently working with e-quest and I was wondering if it was possible to
simulate a building with different floor shapes and zone patterns in wizard

advantage of describing polygons with the autocad interface.

Thank you veru much.

Question:  When we size the design model systems to equal those in the
design documents, and have a baseline system type of packaged single zone.
A packaged single zone is assigned to every zone so system configuration is
different from design to basecase model.  How does one size the basecase
hvac systems?

There can be a large difference but depends on your particular building.
For example, buildings with lots of glass on the east and west.  The cooling
loads in these individual spaces may be quite large, but the east has a high
cooling load in the morning while the west has a high cooling load in the
afternoon/evening.  My understanding for LEED is that the design case
systems are sized as in the design documents.  This provides punishment for
system inefficiency due to oversizing.

How great the difference could be if a system is sized by "block" compaired

being sized by "peak" in Trace? If "sized by peak" means sizing the system
based on peak load, what about "sized by block"? For LEED credit
application, Iov
thought that it is not right to size an AHU by "block" in the design case
while
size it by "peak" in the baseline.

Fernando, 

Yes, you can simulate a building with different floor shapes and zoning 
patterns from the DD wizard mode.

Dear colleagues:
 
My name is Fernando and I work as a university teacher in Madrid, Spain.
 
I'm currently working with e-quest and I was wondering if it was possible 
to simulate a building with different floor shapes and zone patterns in 
wizard mode. I know this is possible with detailed data input mode, but I 
lose the advantage of describing polygons with the autocad interface.
 
Thank you veru much._______________________________________________

Fernando:
 
While in the detailed mode of eQuest click on the 'Building Shell' Icon,
then click '2D Geometry'.....Then right click and scroll down to 'Switch
to Polygon View'.
 
This should allow you to do many of the same AutoCad features and
functions that you could within the Wizard.
 
Hope this helps.

Dear all,

I am currently working on a project where I've to model energy, thermal
and daylight analysis on a very large building. I'm using the link
between Revit MEP2008 and IES. I've also got the full licence for IES's
applications. 
However, when I import the model into IES several issues and problems
occur that I require help with, they are as follows;
1) Some windows disappear. These windows are made up as curtain walls.
Now most of the windows in the model are done the same way but a
particular few disappear, troublesome.
2) External shading devices disappear. These are modelled as a
speciality family. I've tried them previously as windows and they don't
work. I would like to use them as a wall family but due to the
architects 3D modelling procedures and the complexity of the model, we
can't. 
3) One of my rooms is disappearing. Claims it has no bounding elements.
But it has 6 bounding elements (walls, ceiling & floor). 
4) Internal light shelf becomes a "floor" leaving the space reshaped and
obscure.


I'd appreciate any help on the matters and am willing to share my
knowledge to help others. I'm very versed with these issues so please,
don't be cheeky and recommend Autodesk's White Papers on BIM or energy
modelling as I've read them. There is also a detailed discussion about
this on Autodesk's forum

Ronan,

Shading devices do not work in the Revit to IES link.  It's something that 
I have been beating my head against the wall about for a couple months 
now.  There's really no way to easily and quickly bring in external 
shading devices into IES from Revit at this point in time, whether those 
are deep mullions or if they are actual louvers/fins.  Sorry for the bad 
news, but hopefully Autodesk or IES will listen to those of us who need 
this feature and will incorporate it soon.

Ronan,
 
I have only needed to use the interface on one project so far.  I didn't use the REVIT template, but instead imported the geometry into IES and created the necessary elements there.  Window construction, wall construction, scheduling etc. was all done within the IES ModelIT.  The constructions were then assigned to the various components in the model.  I didn't note whether the templates were exported or if the default templates within IES were being used initially.
 
Are you able to add an external shading device to the window (hovering in space)?  I have done this on a regular IES model but not one imported from Revit.
 
I have just upgraded to REVIT MEP 2009, there may be some added features within the software now to create new templates.
Sorry, if that wasn't any help.

If a building less than 3 floors has an air handler that serves multiple
spaces with a capacity of X for the proposed model, then it will require an
hvac system type packaged single zone.  

Would it be correct then to provide a PSZ for each zone modeled?  If so how
should the capacities in the baseline be broken up?  Take the proposed
capacity and proportion it for each zone based on size, loads, etc..  Then
multiply capacities by 1.15 and 1.25 to get a baseline capacity for each
system?  This doesn't account for supply air volumes.

 

Or how about a residential high rise?  The baseline hvac system type would
be PTAC's.  Consider that each building wing is modeled as a large zone (
not a zone for every room ).  When a PTAC was made to serve this large zone
it did not do so well but I did not take much time investigating because I
did not want to waste time on it.  If the parameters are set correctly, a
PTAC can be able to condition a zone no matter the size?

 

Has anyone had these questions before?  The archives and user's manual do
not provide much insight.

Do you know there is a way to create Shading devices in IES. I know if
you have already created them in Revit it is a pain to recreate them in
IES but I can tell you how if you don't already know.

Ronan, 

Shading devices do not work in the Revit to IES link.  It's something
that I have been beating my head against the wall about for a couple
months now.  There's really no way to easily and quickly bring in
external shading devices into IES from Revit at this point in time,
whether those are deep mullions or if they are actual louvers/fins.
Sorry for the bad news, but hopefully Autodesk or IES will listen to
those of us who need this feature and will incorporate it soon.

[Bldg-sim] Issues with IES and Revit

 

 

 





Dear all, 

I am currently working on a project where I've to model energy, thermal
and daylight analysis on a very large building. I'm using the link
between Revit MEP2008 and IES. I've also got the full licence for IES's
applications. 

However, when I import the model into IES several issues and problems
occur that I require help with, they are as follows; 

1) Some windows disappear. These windows are made up as curtain walls.
Now most of the windows in the model are done the same way but a
particular few disappear, troublesome. 

2) External shading devices disappear. These are modelled as a
speciality family. I've tried them previously as windows and they don't
work. I would like to use them as a wall family but due to the
architects 3D modelling procedures and the complexity of the model, we
can't. 

3) One of my rooms is disappearing. Claims it has no bounding elements.
But it has 6 bounding elements (walls, ceiling & floor). 

4) Internal light shelf becomes a "floor" leaving the space reshaped and
obscure. 

I'd appreciate any help on the matters and am willing to share my
knowledge to help others. I'm very versed with these issues so please,
don't be cheeky and recommend Autodesk's White Papers on BIM or energy
modelling as I've read them. There is also a detailed discussion about
this on Autodesk's forum

Ronan,

 

When creating Revit models for the purpose of gbXML, develop a separate
model for this specific purpose. Standard punched openings work better
than curtain walls, but check and see if aligning the curtain walls with
the centerline of their "host" wall will help. Always model external
shades as standard roof elements and make sure one edge aligns with the
centerline of the "host wall".  As for the disappearing room-
investigate it very carefully and you will likely find some oddity in
the connections of the bounding elements that is causing the "hiccup".
For all of these reasons- the normal Revit architecture or mechanical
models will usually not work for the purpose of creating valid gbXML.
Test it early and often as you build it up a gbXML optimized Revit
model.  You are fortunate to have full <VE> because you may still have
to make final corrections in it.

I have a question re. adding a roof monitor to an existing schematic in
DOE2. I have constructed a roof monitor using exterior walls and added the
glazing to the monitor. I will be simulating use of day lighting and
scheduled photo sensors. Questions:

1) do I need to remove the roof of the existing schematic and replace it
with four horizontal exterior walls that will connect the monitor to the
main building? I am assuming the roof will act as a barrier between the
monitor and the main building conditioned space beneath it. Or is this
unnecessary?

2) How do I place a roof on the monitor.do I use a horizontal exterior wall?

Thanks!

Folks:
 
Please refresh my memory. DOE-2 (thus eQuest) requires for weather, at a
minimum:
 
1) Dry Bulb Temp
2) Wet Bulb Temp
3) Wind direction
4) Wind Speed
5) Cloud cover
 
World geometry develops the sun angle and insolation values (as I
recall).
 
The modeler takes an existing locale close to where you need the
weather, takes an actual year of as much of the above 5 categories as
one can, and inlays the actual year info over the TMY year (make sure to
call the new file something else !!).
 
If I leave the Wet Bulb column blank and add Dew Point temperature
instead, is DOE-2 smart enough to generate Wet Bulb from the Dry
Bulb/Dew Point numbers ??
 
Thanks.

John-

I am not certain but I do not think DOE2 can generate the values for
you.  Again not certain, but I think the minimum inputs are:

-Dry bulb Temperature (?F)
-Wet bulb Temperature (?F)
-Atmospheric Pressure (inches of Hg times 100)
-Wind Speed (knots)
-Wind Direction (compass points 0-15, with 0 being north, 1 NNE, etc.)
-Cloud Amount (0 - 10, with 0 clear and 10 totally cloudy)
-Cloud Type (0, 1, or 2)
     0 is cirrus or cirrostratus, the least opaque;
     1 is stratus or stratus fractus, the most opaque; and
     2 is all other cloud types, of medium opacity
-Humidity Ratio (pounds of water per pound of dry air)
-Density of Air (lb/ft3)
-Specific Enthalpy (Btu/lb)
-Rain Flag (0 means it is not raining; 1 means it is)
-Snow Flag (0 means it is not snowing; 1 means it is)

DOE2 does not require solar variables but they will provide more
accurate results.

Thanks Steve:

The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) can give us years of weather data, but apparently with Dry Bulb and Dew Point.  That's why I am trying to use these, without another 8,760 calculations to get Wet Bulb..

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Approach to Modeling a Central Energy Plant
Message-ID: <F94102E3F5278A41AE61586593CB484402868158@sv04005.rmf.com>

Hello All,

 

I recently received a request to model a large boiler plant. The plant
is actually a major renovation, so major the project is going for
LEED-NC. Before I start gathering materials for the model I want to make
sure I have the correct approach in place.

 

The overwhelming majority of the plant is mechanical space that is not
conditioned - just mechanically ventilated.

 

Approximately 200 SF (auxiliary office space) of the building is heated
and cooled.

 

My understanding is that I will need to model the whole building with
the mechanical portion being served by ventilation fans and the
auxiliary spaces served by heating/cooling systems. The boilers will be
metered as process loads and all other mechanical equipment will act the
same as in a "standard" energy model. I am concerned about meeting and
exceeding the two point requirement for EA credit 1.

 

Is this the correct approach? If you have any tips or tricks from
previously modeled CEPs please share.

 

Thanks in advance.

 

Seth Spangler, LEED(r) AP 

Design Engineer

General Description:

In all developed countries, the pressing architectural problem of our
time as we try

to reduce our carbon dioxide production by 90% is not the design of new
buildings,

but the refurbishment of our existing stock.

Can existing buildings, both commercial and residential, be modified to
deliver at

least 90% reductions in carbon emissions, and can this be done for less
than the cost

of demolition and rebuilding? What techniques are likely to be the most
effective, to

offer the lowest cost and the greatest reliability, while being the
least disruptive to

the on-going use of the buildings?

Today's buildings will comprise half of the total building stock of
2030. While we

have some knowledge of how to make new buildings 'zero emissions', or
even

net producers of energy, we must devise techniques for converting and
upgrading

existing buildings in order to achieve a low-carbon future.

The deadline for applications is 15 May 2008. Application forms are
available from

There is degree day data out there for a 55F basis.? But, I haven't used this type of data in a long time though (10 or 15?years?).? At that time at least, 55F?was considered to be a more up to date balance point temperature.

In my experience from analyzing utility usage data with a floating balance 
point, the typical effective heating balance point in US homes will usually be 
in the range of 54F - 62F (for true heating climates).  Newer homes are usually 
closer to the low end of the scale while older homes are on the higher end. 
Electrically heated homes tend to be on the lower end but it's not clear how 
much of that difference is the effects of vintage/thermal integrity vs. lower 
thermostat set points or zoning.

There may be some published results in ACEEE summer study proceedings, but I 
can't recall any specific reference.

Hussein,

If my understanding on this issue is clear, then for heating it is the
statistically-determined ODB temperature at which the heating load on a
building approaches zero.  I agree with Mr. Bishop about 65F being
outmoded because I have studied both short and long term end-use metered
data and performed the regressions for single family detached residences
in Florida and New England (USA), both for old and new homes.

This balance point may be somewhat useful on a global basis in analyzing
the heating performance characteristics of typical homes, but for
individual homes the variance can be large, with most homes falling
within the range of about 50 to about 65 degrees F, and a few homes
beyond those limits.  The "tighter" the home, the lower the balance
point.

The balance point will also vary with time of day as the internal and
solar heat gains vary (say, from daytime to nighttime).

If you are looking for an overall degree-day (from daily average
temperatures) base, I would recommend something on the order of 55
degrees F for newer homes and 60 for older homes.  These will put you
closer to reality for average homes.  If you define degree-days from
hourly data as degree-hours per day divided by 24, you will need to use
even lower base temperatures (around 50) for heating and higher (around
70) for cooling.

I wish you good luck with such a "slippery" number, and I hope this
helps.  There really are no precise numbers to offer you for specific
applications.  And I do not recommend applying these numbers or this
method to large commercial buildings at all.

Dr. Abaza :

The TREAT (Targeted Residential Energy Analysis Tool) whole building 
energy simulation software package can determine a building's balance 
point (both heating and cooling) given the building description. One can 
construct a 'simple' model of a typical house in about 15 minutes, and 
TMY2 weather files for all 50 states are included for driving the 
model.  It would be pretty simple to make some parametric runs varying 
both climate and envelope /infiltration to produce a range of balance 
point temps. We have found both insulation levels and air infiltration 
(tightness of the envelope) often have the greatest effect on the 
balance point of a given structure, along with the temperature setpoints 
used for heating and cooling. Significant internal gains, of course, can 
also drive the balance points.

A 30 day fully functional version (free download) of the TREAT software 
is available from http://www.treatsoftware.com

Best,

We looked at balance temperature in my Master's Thesis at the UW-Madison
Solar Lab back in 1992. It was sponsored by the Wisconsin Center for Demand
Side Research (now the Energy Center of Wisconsin). Balance temperature was
not the main focus of our research, but we examined interval gas consumption
for a sample of about 100 homes - all from a Midwestern city. The data was
on a 5-minute basis. I can't recall how the sample was determined, so I'm
unsure how representative was the mix of homes. They were from a variety of
sizes, but it looks like most of them were built in the 80s, so they were
newish homes at the time. The average balance temp was about 65F. I'm not
sure the spread around that mean.

I would like to specify a heat exchanger efficiency between the ground loop
and the heat pump loop.  I have found a work-around in that I can use
"Supply Loss DT" instead.

Message-ID: <22B8ACB46B958A4F9643482565E275EF484768@ke-mail.BKAINC.local>

Hello All,

 

I have two questions about exhaust.  I am modeling a building that has
an attached garage and needs ventilation.  Would it be correct to
calculate the fan power from G3.1.2.9 since there really is no air being
supplied to the garage and just an exhaust fan, to me this would seem to
over credit this system in the baseline system.  

 

Also have a large kitchen hood that is going to be served by an exhaust
fan with a vfd so the exhaust is going to be VAV and there will be a
runaround coil that will be used to preheat the OA coming into the AHU.
Is there a good way to model this VAV exhaust system with heat recovery.


 

Thank you all,

Costs

Solar photovoltaic or PV systems are quoted in terms of dollars per Watt.
The larger the system, the lower the cost per Watt- be sure your contractor
is quoting fully installed cost. These costs vary widely by installer, by
state and by technology implemented. Module costs for installers run
$4-5/Watt. Beware snake oil salesmen whose costs are too close to these.

 

Solar thermal is a many headed beast with multiple applications and even
more widely varying costs. That being said, because these systems are much
more efficient (60-80% verses 12-18% for PV) they have much better payback.

 

The best guide for the state credit is at
http://www.ncsc.ncsu.edu/information_resources/fact_sheets.cfm ("Guidelines
for NC Tax Credit"). Information for other states can be found at
www.dsireusa.org <http://www.dsireusa.org/> . The best guide for the federal
credit is at http://www.seia.org/taxmanualdownload.php. 

 

Benefits

There are two main drivers for payback on solar generation equipment. Green
power subsidies or the avoided cost/expense for electricity are never at the
forefront. The primary driver is finding the best way to leverage the
available tax benefits that determines how feasible a solar project is in
North Carolina.

 

If this value is fully captured, these are good, albeit conservative,
investments. Larger systems are "better" investments in terms of payback and
internal rate of return because of the lower cost per installed Watt of
production capacity- next to tax credits, system cost in terms of $s per
Watt installed is the biggest driver for good financials. 

 

The other types of subsidies- avoided costs and green power premiums- are
important to the long term cash flow for a project. You are purchasing
capital to create cash flow with a PV system, just like any other piece of
equipment. For estimates on potential output, which determines the value
that the installed equipment will create, consult PV Watts
<http://www.nrel.gov/rredc/pvwatts/> . Using North Carolina for example, 1kW
of installed capacity typically produces 1,100 kWh of electricity per year.
At $.17/kWh (avoided cost or qualified facility rate plus a small greenpower
premium), that 1kW will create $187 per year in revenue, minus metering
costs.

 

Another benefit of purchasing solar equipment over greening up power by
purchasing RECs is that the equipment has real, balance-sheet value- it is
an asset, verses an expense. While it is not as cost-effective to purchase
capacity verses someone else's production, once the system is purchased and
off the balance sheet, is 

 

The other values these investment have for your business is also comprised
of the future value of this type of progressive, carbon-conscious investment
as well as any marketing, branding or positioning value, which, while murky,
does have a dollar value attached to it at the end of the day. 

 

There will be a market in North Carolina for solar energy within the next
two years because of our new Renewables and Efficiency Portfolio Standard,
and  this will create subsidies that we believe will have to be more
generous than the NC GreenPower program to generate the supply to meet
demand. 

 

National carbon regulation, which would create additional value for this
investment, is very likely with any of the potential next US
administrations. Even with fairly conservative cash flow projections of this
values, PV systems in NC can feasible reach payback in 9-10 years.

 

Challenges

Other than the financial hurdles of leveraging tax credits and projecting
future value of renewable energy for accountants, there are also technical
issues, which are both regulatory and site related.

 

>From a regulatory standpoint, it is important to know rules for net metering
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_metering>  and interconnection
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interconnection>  in your state. Some of these
are favorable, others are not, some states don't have them (and they vary
from utility to utility). These are too varied to address here- to check on
the rules in your state, consult the Green
<http://www.eere.energy.gov/greenpower/markets/netmetering.shtml>  Power
Network and forward questions to your local State
<http://www.eere.energy.gov/state_energy_program/seo_contacts.cfm>  Energy
Office.

 

Site related issues include:

  Roof shading- Is your roof shaded, either by rooftop mechanicals, false or
parapet roofs or trees and other buildings? These are all problems to
overcome.

  Membrane type- No one wants holes in their roof; the ideal commercial
situation is where a ballasted system, with no roof penetrations. If the
membrane isn't adhered it takes more weight to ballast the system 

  Roof layout- If you want PV or solar thermal, design your roof to be flat.

  Building Mechanicals- Many building mechanical systems can take solar
thermal input, including preheat or direct heat from a heat exchanger that
is running off thermal storage that is primarily for domestic hot water. If
this infrastructure is not built in- in terms of space and technology-
retrofits can be difficult. In addition, the design stage can be an
engineering nightmare and prohibitive for small installation firms in the
absence of approved project funding or a formal retainer/design contract.

Seth,

 

Keep in mind that the model for the baseline building requires heating
and cooling for conditioned spaces. The boiler room itself may qualify
as a semi-heated space, which will change the cooling requirement. Take
a look at Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 for details.

 

The huge process load will definitely make it hard to reduce the overall
energy consumption. You may be able to limit the process load in the
model to 25% of the overall load. Take a close look at the LEED-NC
Reference Guide. Good luck!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Approach to Modeling a Central Energy Plant

 

Hello All,

 

I recently received a request to model a large boiler plant. The plant
is actually a major renovation, so major the project is going for
LEED-NC. Before I start gathering materials for the model I want to make
sure I have the correct approach in place.

 

The overwhelming majority of the plant is mechanical space that is not
conditioned - just mechanically ventilated.

 

Approximately 200 SF (auxiliary office space) of the building is heated
and cooled.

 

My understanding is that I will need to model the whole building with
the mechanical portion being served by ventilation fans and the
auxiliary spaces served by heating/cooling systems. The boilers will be
metered as process loads and all other mechanical equipment will act the
same as in a "standard" energy model. I am concerned about meeting and
exceeding the two point requirement for EA credit 1.

 

Is this the correct approach? If you have any tips or tricks from
previously modeled CEPs please share.

 

Thanks in advance.

Amarpreet,
In terms of installers, I would recommend looking for NABCEP certification. 
The American Solar Energy Society (ASES) runs a fantastic website http://www.findsolar.com/
 
It has great cost estimators specific to utilities and regions, as well as finding installers (it will tell you if they are NABCEP certified) in your area.

Dr. Abaza :

The TREAT (Targeted Residential Energy Analysis Tool) whole building
energy simulation software package can determine a building's balance
point (both heating and cooling) given the building description. One can
construct a 'simple' model of a typical house in about 15 minutes, and
TMY2 weather files for all 50 states are included for driving the model.
It would be pretty simple to make some parametric runs varying both
climate and envelope /infiltration to produce a range of balance point
temps. We have found both insulation levels and air infiltration
(tightness of the envelope) often have the greatest effect on the
balance point of a given structure, along with the temperature setpoints
used for heating and cooling. Significant internal gains, of course, can
also drive the balance points.

A 30 day fully functional version (free download) of the TREAT software
is available from http://www.treatsoftware.com

Vikram -

The balance point tool looks extremely useful during the building design stages when it wpould be much more practical than a detailed energy model.
I look forward to its availability.
Do you intend it to be for commercial as well as residential buildings?  
In that case it would need a way to input code-required minimum ventilation rates with some heat exchange options.
The formula Qint = M*Cp UAbld x (Tdes-Tbal) looks odd. Maybe I don't understand the units, but should that be Qint = (M/hr*Cp + UAbld) x (Tdes-Tbal)?

Thanks,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED exceptional calc guidelines for purchased chilled
	water and heating water?
Message-ID: <328706.67616.qm@web45102.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

Hi All,
I have heard that LEED has published exceptional calculation guidelines for determining/demonstrating the cost of "purchased" chilled water and hot water when your building is served by an existing central plant.? I looked on the LEED website but could not find anything.? (I found guidelines for calculating and modeling a?CHP plant but not for a regular chilled water and hot water plant).? Does anyone know if LEED has published any guidelines for calculating these costs???If so, could you please point me to where they are located on the website.
What are other people's experiences with LEED v2.2 with respect to demonstrating the cost of "purchased" chilled and hot water?from an existing central plant?? Have you just had to?indicate the cost of chw and hw on the template like?you would for electricity or gas???Or, have you been required to?submit additional documentation and calculations?? 
Thanks for your help.

David,
Thanks for pointing that out - there is a typo in the paper. The formula
should read
 
 
QSOL + QEQU + QPPL = (M*CP + UABLD) x (TDES - TBAL)

The software uses the correct formula though. At this point we (Lord
Aeck Sargent & The Rocky Mountain Institute) use this as a schematic
design tool on quite a few projects, and find its quite useful. The plan
is to ultimately make this available freely (I would like to make it
work with the new TMY3 files before I start giving it away though). 

Once again - thanks for pointing out the typo - sharp eyes (sharper than
mine when I was typing out the paper at 2am).

Vikram -
The balance point tool looks extremely useful during the building design
stages when it wpould be much more practical than a detailed energy
model.
I look forward to its availability.
Do you intend it to be for commercial as well as residential buildings?

In that case it would need a way to input code-required minimum
ventilation rates with some heat exchange options.
The formula Qint = M*Cp UAbld x (Tdes-Tbal) looks odd. Maybe I don't
understand the units, but should that be Qint = (M/hr*Cp + UAbld) x
(Tdes-Tbal)?
Thanks,

	Dr. Abaza :
	
	The TREAT (Targeted Residential Energy Analysis Tool) whole
building
	energy simulation software package can determine a building's
balance
	point (both heating and cooling) given the building description.
One can
	construct a 'simple' model of a typical house in about 15
minutes, and
	TMY2 weather files for all 50 states are included for driving
the model.
	It would be pretty simple to make some parametric runs varying
both
	climate and envelope /infiltration to produce a range of balance
point
	temps. We have found both insulation levels and air infiltration
	(tightness of the envelope) often have the greatest effect on
the
	balance point of a given structure, along with the temperature
setpoints
	used for heating and cooling. Significant internal gains, of
course, can
	also drive the balance points.
	
	A 30 day fully functional version (free download) of the TREAT
software
	is available from http://www.treatsoftware.com

Christian,

The roof monitor you add to the building should be added to the space and not to the plenum. The roof of the monitor can be constructed using a horizontal exterior wall and specified the construction used for the general roof of the building.

Note the roof that you think will act as a barrier in the model is not a part of the space but of the plenum. The space simply has a vertical glazing above from which the light is coming. So it doesn't know there is a barrier.
However it is recommended that you create the four planes of the roof using exterior wall surfaces to estimate the conductance from the roof surfaces correctly.

Do you actually have a plenum in this scenario where you have a roof monitor. If not all the roof surfaces should be a part of the space and not the plenum to account for the correct heat load from the roof.

Hopefully this helps

Message-ID: <69a9bc0a0805110657m114a4e34t6c835b22ac0ae23d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm working on a system where a geothermal loop and a cooling tower both
supply cooling to a WSHP loop.  I am trying to control the loop so that
cooling load goes first to the geothermal loop and second to the cooling
tower as the ground loop will not be sufficient to provide cooling
year-round.

I have run up against some funny things.

1.  If I let the program auto-size the cooling tower and use it's default
control, I get a negative number for heat rejection energy (the cooling
tower is given a capacity of -10 MBTU/hr with fan energy listed at -41 kw)

2.  If I size the cooling tower according to design at 4.2 MBTU/hr, the
entire program shuts down

3.  If I try to run the model without the cooling tower, the entire program
shuts down

Any thoughts?

Thank You,

I suspect the problem is with how the geothermal loop is being sized. Is
the loop size based on the heating load?

In-Reply-To: <48286E13.5050308@hvacware.net>
Message-ID: <21B0B92BAE9B75458CA9781211D5330301EDEF77@CD1001-M200.corp.ads>

Does anyone have any information on any ASHRAE 90.1-2004 addenda that addresses G3.1.2.8 Design Air Flow Rates.
 
The 2004 standard uses a 20?F delta T to size the supply air flows.  
 
I have a lab project where the supply air needs to be 100% OA and 8 AC per hour.
 
I read here: http://www.i2sl.org/eleclibrary/documents/maor.pdf See page 22 that supposedly there is an Addendum that addresses this issue.
 
Does anyone know where I can find that?  I have looked through all the Addendum on the ASHRAE website and came up empty.
 
I guess the only other thing I think is a loophole is G3.1.2.5: which states that the baseline and proposed must have the same ventilation rates.  This to me reads that if you are required to supply say 100% OA then both case should have it.
 
Any suggestions?
 
Thanks!
 
Tim.

I know it is a DOE based program but would like to know more from anyone
out there using it. Would you recommend it? I imagine this is mostly used
by consultants in Canada? The price is right, but so is the price of

I am a regular EE4 user.  The primary benefit of using EE4 is that when 
you enter your building's parameters, it automatically creates a 
reference building that meets the Canadian Model National Energy Code 
for Buildings (MNECB).  It is a graphical interface which runs the 
DOE-2.1e calculation engine.  It comes bundled with CWEC weather for 43 
Canadian sites.  By default, it deletes the supporting DOE files, but 
clearing a check box will give you the raw DOE input and output files 
for both the reference and proposed  buildings (proposed being the 
entered building, reference being the MNECB building).  Data entry is in 
either of SI or IP units.  One of the best features is the wall U-value 
calculator.  It explicitly demonstrates the impact of either wood or 
steel framing passing through insulation layers.  There is a useful 
modeling guide online. 

On the downside, EE4 has a tree-structured data entry with no CAD 
interface.  (In fact, there is no X-Y coordinates to any of the exterior 
surfaces.)  Thus, building envelope take off data entry is much slower 
than in a tool such as eQUEST or VisualDOE where the CAD drawing can be 
imported and traced.  There are less mechanical systems in EE4 then the 
DOE-2.1e engine and there are some workarounds embedded in the 
software.  (e.g. heat recovery on zonal type systems is achieved by 
reducing the supply fan volume in the proposed building.)  There is no 
provision for running parametric runs within EE4.  If your project is 
not in Canada, you may have to define the building and then run DOE as a 
standalone to use weather data not included in the Canadian data set.

On the whole, I prefer eQUEST and will use it first -- primarily for the 
greater speed in defining the building and doing the envelope take 
offs.  Unless you are creating models and comparing them to the Canadian 
MNECB (which I do fairly frequently), there is no significant advantage 
to EE4. 

Hope this helps.

Message-ID: <55BA83825A482144A8637F9CAA981F7610326276@las-mail.lordaecksargent.internal>

I am modeling an apartment style dormitory for a project in Atlanta, GA.
Each of the 45 units is served by its own heat pump, along with a few
zones for public areas. For an energy efficiency grant application I
have compared the designed system, a ground source heat pump, with an
air source heat pump prescribed by 90.1. Other than the systems, the
models are identical. 
The energy use for space cooling is significantly higher for the GSHP
system (24,000 kWh vs. 17,000 kWh). Because the power required to run
pumps offsets the savings in heating energy, this destroys the rationale
for spending the extra money on the Ground Source Heat Pump, as well as
our chances of receiving the grant.
Has any one encountered this issue?

As far as cooling energy goes, what are your design case cooling EIR with the geothermal system, and your baseline case cooling EIR for the air-to-air selections?

Is the heat pump fan power parameter the same in both cases, and modeled separately from the cooling energy?

Thomas:

The EER and the COP for the GSHP should be substantially higher than the 
air source unit.  Your heat pump manufacturer should have separate ARI 
ratings for air source and GSHP heat pumps.  This is a large source of 
added efficiency.  If your EERs and COPS are not higher with GSHP, you 
are missing out on the advantage entirely.  You should contact your heat 
pump manufacturer for this information.  Both Climate Master and Florida 
Heat Pump have separate ratings for their systems and the GSGHP ratings 
are even higher than the water source heat pump ratings.  Air source 
will be much lower, I believe.  Please check your EERS!

Other areas to increase efficiency modeling accuracy:
VFD on the main circulating pump:  Be sure to use an accurate horsepower 
ratio.
Use the actual HP fan wattages, not the nominal horsepower.  This can 
make a big difference on some units.

Thomas, 

 

You should definitively have more savings than that, even if there is
the pump energy. 

One first thing to check: the efficiency of GSHP should be much higher
than that of air-source heat pumps in both heating and cooling modes.

The efficiency of any water source heat pump is dictated by the temperature
of the water loop.  Create an hourly report output showing geothermal loop
temperatures.  You can then check this against the heat pump chart to
determine if your heat pumps are operating efficiently.  Depending on the
ground temperature, a geothermal system can start to heat up, lowering the
efficiency of attached equipment.  However, I would still be surprised to
learn that an air source heat pump still performed better.

Also, in order to make variable volume pumping work properly, you must
specify Isolation valves on the heat pumps.  This allows water to bypass any
heat pumps that are not calling for water flow.  This lowers the pressure in
the system.

Good morning,

 

I am having similar results with a ground-coupled heat pump and am
following this thread closely. I am only realizing savings of about 5%
to 10% over an air-source HP.

 

I believe I am incorrectly separating out the fan-energy on the
air-source units. What is the procedure for getting the fan and
compressor energy separate on the air-source units (12 SEER air-source
unit per 90.1-2004, baseline design)? If I understand correctly, the
GCHP efficiency stated under ARI 13256 does not include external fan
energy or external pump energy, and therefore, the stated GCHP
efficiency can be converted into EIR directly. Correct? 

 

Also, for the GCHP the correct number to use is the "GLHP EER" value
from the manufacturer based on ARI 13256, which is higher than the
water-loop HP (WLHP) ARI EER? Is that correct?

 

Experience tells me a GCHP should realize more savings than what I am
getting, which leads me to believe I am inputting "garbage" into the
model. Thanks for your help!

 

Adam Young

Thomas, 

 

You should definitively have more savings than that, even if there is
the pump energy. 

One first thing to check: the efficiency of GSHP should be much higher
than that of air-source heat pumps in both heating and cooling modes.

I am modeling an apartment style dormitory for a project in Atlanta, GA.
Each of the 45 units is served by its own heat pump, along with a few
zones for public areas. For an energy efficiency grant application I
have compared the designed system, a ground source heat pump, with an
air source heat pump prescribed by 90.1. Other than the systems, the
models are identical. 

The energy use for space cooling is significantly higher for the GSHP
system (24,000 kWh vs. 17,000 kWh). Because the power required to run
pumps offsets the savings in heating energy, this destroys the rationale
for spending the extra money on the Ground Source Heat Pump, as well as
our chances of receiving the grant.

Has any one encountered this issue?

Message-ID: <69a9bc0a0805140750h4502444fv7ce330664bb4cdfe@mail.gmail.com>

In the past week I have been comparing a GSHP to a WLHP system with a
cooling tower system and it seems to me that eQuest is underestimating
cooling tower energy use, particularly fan energy use.  Are there any
resources that explain how eQuest calculates cooling tower energy use, or
has anyone done tests to confirm cooling tower energy use?

I am concerned that the cooling tower allows the fan to operate at below
0.01% of it's design airlfow in a given hour, this means that when there are
low cooling loads, the fan is allowed to short-cycle--a condition not
allowed in the real world.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <cdf76d820805140912s7b954b2bo89d736b9c3a5646@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm working on the energy model for a school building with 43 zones with
each zone connected to a ground source heat pump. Right now the model is for
design development but eventually the same model could be used for LEED.

I can't seem to get the percent of hours any system zone outside of
throttling range below 48%. The system sizing ratio of all airside systems
is currently at 2. As per HVAC design, the depth of ground source loop is
400 ft and I tried increasing it to 600 ft and that only helps a little.

In the SS-R report, the undercooled hours for different zones are in the
200+ range while the underheated hours are in the range of 200 to 500. I'm
using the Dodge City, KS weather file.

Also the current annual energy consumption is as low as 18.1 kBtu/ft2, I
know that will change as the % hours outside the throttling range changes
but still seems very low.

Thanks for your help,

Great news on the TMY3 weather data.  We want to start using it in eQuest.

However, FYI... in order to test the new TMY3 files out, we downloaded a TMY3
weather file for Little Rock, AR.  Then we converted the TMY3 file to TMY2
(using same name as TMY2 --> LITTLEAR.BIN ), placed it in a new folder under
eQuest weather (Weather\TMY3) then tried to use in eQuest and got an error,
and the simulation would not run.

Is there any additional information that we need to know in order to make
this work?

Any information would be appreciated.

Thanks!

NREL Releases Updated Typical Meteorological Year Data Set
May 1, 2008

The U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory (NREL) today released an updated typical 
meteorological year (TMY) data set derived from the 
1991-2005 National Solar Radiation Data Base update. The 
TMY3 data and user's manual are available at

http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3

The new data sets update and expand the TMY2 data sets 
released by NREL in 1994. The TMY3 data sets provide greater 
geographical coverage than previous TMY sets with 
information on 1,020 locations in the United States, project 
leader Steve Wilcox said. Only 239 locations were listed in 
the TMY2 data set.

A TMY data set contains typical meteorological values for 
specific locations. TMY data sets are widely used by 
building designers and others for modeling renewable energy 
conversion systems. Although not designed to show 
meteorological extremes, TMY data sets hold hourly values of 
solar radiation and meteorological elements for a one-year 
period that typify climate based on a much longer period of 
time.

Unless they are revised, computer programs designed for 
previous TMY data sets will not work with TMY3 data. NREL 
provides a software utility that allows reformatting of the 
TMY3 data to the TMY2 format at the TMY3 link above.

The TMY3 data sets and the users manual were produced by 
NREL's Electric and Systems Center under the Solar Resource 
Characterization Project, which is funded and monitored by 
DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Office.

NREL is the U.S. Department of Energy's primary national 
laboratory for renewable energy and energy efficiency 
research and development. NREL is operated for DOE by 
Midwest Research Institute and Battelle.

Be aware that what NREL calls TMY2 weather data is true text based TMY2 
weather data per their original definition.  DOE2 (eQuest) uses a binary 
version of the TMY2 weather files.  The binary version is about 1/10th

another weather processor to convert the true TMY2 into a binary version 
(xxxxxx.BIN) for use with eQuest.  You can't just rename the file as it 
sounds like you did.

step 1 - Get the TMY3 weather file for your location
step 2 - Use NREL's TMY3toTMY2 converter to convert it to TMY2
step 3 - Use DOE2 or EnergyPlus weather utilities to convert the text 
based TMY2 weather file to a binary version for use with DOE2 (eQuest)

I think you skipped step 3.

Dear all,

I'm working on the energy model for a school building with 43 zones with
each zone connected to a ground source heat pump. Right now the model is for
design development but eventually the same model could be used for LEED.

I can't seem to get the percent of hours any system zone outside of
throttling range below 48%. The system sizing ratio of all airside systems
is currently at 2. As per HVAC design, the depth of ground source loop is
400 ft and I tried increasing it to 600 ft and that only helps a little.

In the SS-R report, the undercooled hours for different zones are in the
200+ range while the underheated hours are in the range of 200 to 500. I'm
using the Dodge City, KS weather file.

Also the current annual energy consumption is as low as 18.1 kBtu/ft2, I
know that will change as the % hours outside the throttling range changes
but still seems very low.

Thanks for your help,

I am attempting to follow these steps, but I can't seem to figure out how to use the DOE2 unilities.  It looks like it is only DOS based and I am not familiar with DOS.  Could you walk me through the steps to convert from .TM2 to .bin using the DOE2 utility?
Thanks,
Tim

I've just gone through this procedure, i.e., creating *.BIN versions, for 50 
of these new TMY3 weather files, using the TMY3toTMY2 and doewth programs. 
Please note that doewth reads only a 5-number station number, while these 
new TMY3/TMY2 files use a 6-number station number. Thus, you need to delete 
the last number from the station number both on the INPUT.TMP and the first 
line of the raw TMY2 weather file.

Ramana,
Check your schedules - make sure you are ramping up (or down) your
temperatures in a reasonable increment. Also - make sure your fans are
allowed to turn on at the appropriate times too.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQUEST - percent of hours outside throttling range


Dear all,

I'm working on the energy model for a school building with 43 zones with
each zone connected to a ground source heat pump. Right now the model is
for design development but eventually the same model could be used for
LEED.

I can't seem to get the percent of hours any system zone outside of
throttling range below 48%. The system sizing ratio of all airside
systems is currently at 2. As per HVAC design, the depth of ground
source loop is 400 ft and I tried increasing it to 600 ft and that only
helps a little.

In the SS-R report, the undercooled hours for different zones are in the
200+ range while the underheated hours are in the range of 200 to 500.
I'm using the Dodge City, KS weather file.

Also the current annual energy consumption is as low as 18.1 kBtu/ft2, I
know that will change as the % hours outside the throttling range
changes but still seems very low.

Thanks for your help,

Be aware that what NREL calls TMY2 weather data is true text based TMY2 
weather data per their original definition.  DOE2 (eQuest) uses a binary

version of the TMY2 weather files.  The binary version is about 1/10th 
the file size of the original text based TMY2 file.  You need to use 
another weather processor to convert the true TMY2 into a binary version

(xxxxxx.BIN) for use with eQuest.  You can't just rename the file as it 
sounds like you did.

step 1 - Get the TMY3 weather file for your location
step 2 - Use NREL's TMY3toTMY2 converter to convert it to TMY2
step 3 - Use DOE2 or EnergyPlus weather utilities to convert the text 
based TMY2 weather file to a binary version for use with DOE2 (eQuest)

I think you skipped step 3.

I am attempting to follow these steps, but I can't seem to figure out
how to use the DOE2 unilities.  It looks like it is only DOS based and I
am not familiar with DOS.  Could you walk me through the steps to
convert from .TM2 to .bin using the DOE2 utility?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Vertical butt joint glazing - thermal bridging
Message-ID: <705380.50717.qm@web44804.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

Hello Chris,

Seems like you would need to (appropriately) average out "edge of
glass" 
and "center of glass" u-values. This may be a function of the size of 
the glass plane, i.e. a large glass plane will have predominantly 
"center of glass" u-value characteristics rather than "edge of glass". 
My question back to the bldg-sim(ers) will be -- are there any studies
/ 
empirical data drawing relationship between edge effects and center of 
glass conductance values with respect to different types of glazings
and 
their sizes.

Neeraj is correct regarding the size (and aspect ratio) of the pane making a difference. Essentially - the ratio of perimeter to area s a bid riving factor. I think you could arrive at the overall U-value using Window 5.2 by LBNL - it allows for different window sizes, and you can customize your frame conductance.
 
With regards to frame conductance, most manufacturers will give you those numbers if you ask them - they should have it for butt glazed systems too (I assume you mean structural silicone glazing where the frame is behind the glass).

and if the project is not very complicated, Trace is pretty good program.
It can rotate the building for you, calculate the unmet hours, calculate the baseline fan power. It can do simply daylighting modeling.
It can't simulate solar panel and radiant cooling system. I am not sure about the displacement ventilation.
Also, using it for LEED modeling is totally a different complexity level compared using it for load calculation. If you plan to use for LEED modeling, you should keep it separated from load calculation.

The DOE2 documentation is a little confusing in this regard. Here are
the general steps:

1. Copy your TMY2 file to DOE2's EXENT directory and rename to
WEATHR.TMP
2. Create a file called INPUT.TMP in the EXENT directory
3. In the INPUT.TMP file, put the following text. Be sure to replace the
city, state, and station number as appropriate for your location. You
can find this information in the first line of the TMY2 file.

PACK
PHOENIX AZ TMY2
TMY2  23183
STAT
END

4. Run the DOEWTH.EXE executable (it will automatically use the
WEATHR.TMP and INPUT.TMP files above as inputs). This will create a
NEWTH.TMP file in the EXENT directory that is your bin weather file for
use with DOE2. Just rename to Location.bin and you're set.

As I mentioned in a previous BLDG-SIM post yesterday, you must change the 
station number from 6 numbers to 5 in both the INPUT.TMP file and the first 
header line of the TMY3/TMY2, i.e., WEATHR.TMP, file. If you don't, you will
either get a warning that the station number in the INPUT.TMP is too big, or 
another one that the station number doesn't exist on the WEATHR.TMP file.

Is the room's ventilation controlled to maintain a maximum temperature for the animals, or only for ventilation rates?

However, I think there is a little bit of a disconnect in submitting the simulation as if it were cooled, and then having results with no cooling energy.  Maybe this topic is suitable for a credit interpretation request?

Allan,
 
No.  There are no requirements in ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G for cooling
space thermostat settings; therefore you are allowed to set the cooling
thermostat to any temperature that you choose as long as the settings are
the same for both the baseline and proposed models.  You did not mention
whether or not your models are being used for LEED certification, but this
method of setting cooling thermostat setpoints high enough to eliminate
cooling energy has been accepted by USGBC Energy and Atmosphere TAG and LEED
reviewers on other LEED projects.  Note that this is my personal opinion and
should not be taken as an official ruling from ASHRAE or USGBC.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED eQuest model - no heating designed
Message-ID: <17731.38472.qm@web45106.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

Hello all --
I am doing this eQuest model for LEED purpose. In the
current mechanical design, there is no heating system.
Per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the baseline model in this
climate is Packaged Terminal AC with Electric Heat
Pump. Now, I got two questions:

1. What should the heating system be in the proposed
model? Supposely fan coil units are providing cooling.

2. There is still some heating energy consumption(1%)
for the baseline building, even if I gave a very low
heating thermostat (38oF). Any suggestions for this? 

Thanks for any suggestions. 

Regards, 
Anna

Not having looked too closely at the options, I would suggest not centrifugal.  

Centrifugals are almost always water cooled, have modulating capabilites from10% to 100% capacity, and generally dont go below 200 tons capacity.  They are positive displacment compressors and will follow the "fan laws", meaning there is a cubic relationship between energy used and cooling capacity (tons).  Similar to a centrifugal pump and fan.

Scrolls are (until the very near future) air cooled and on/off control.  They are staged.  You wont see them over about 150 tons total chiller size.  Part load capacity is pretty constant, in terms of kW/ton.  There are usually multiple stages.  At 50% load, half the compressors (therefore power requirement) is used.

Generally speaking, scroll IPLVs run about 1.1 kW/ton
water cooled centrifguals operate at around .50 kW/ton.  But cooling towers need to be added, as well as condenser water pumps.  

Lots of variables to consider.  

Hope this was helpful.

Thanks Bill, that is correct.  Scrolls (reciprocating, screw) ARE positive displacment compressors.  

As I was writting I had a sense I typed this incorrectly.  But I knew what I meant and did not read what I wrote.

If anyone cares to learn more, read ASHRAE Handbook Chapter S34 for details.

  Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Scroll Chiller

   

  Not having looked too closely at the options, I would suggest not centrifugal.  

   

  Centrifugals are almost always water cooled, have modulating capabilites from10% to 100% capacity, and generally dont go below 200 tons capacity.  They are positive displacment compressors and will follow the "fan laws", meaning there is a cubic relationship between energy used and cooling capacity (tons).  Similar to a centrifugal pump and fan.

   

  Scrolls are (until the very near future) air cooled and on/off control.  They are staged.  You wont see them over about 150 tons total chiller size.  Part load capacity is pretty constant, in terms of kW/ton.  There are usually multiple stages.  At 50% load, half the compressors (therefore power requirement) is used.

   

  Generally speaking, scroll IPLVs run about 1.1 kW/ton

  water cooled centrifguals operate at around .50 kW/ton.  But cooling towers need to be added, as well as condenser water pumps.  

   

  Lots of variables to consider.  

   

  Hope this was helpful.

    SIM List,

                    I need to model a scroll chiller (. Does anyone have an opinion on which eQUEST chiller is a reasonable choice for this? I was thinking that centrifugal would be the closest but this is simply based on mechanical operation. I would like to choose the closest model based on performance.

Dear Engaged Participants:

The conversation we've been having since we started to work 
on LEED 2009
has gone something like this:

Person A: ?Global warming doesn't give us much time.?
Person B: ?But we can't address much of anything, let alone 
global
warming, if we're only dealing with a small fraction of the 
entire built
environment. We need to get everyone involved.?
Person A: ?Yes, but why get them involved in a system that 
doesn't take
them far enough to save us from ourselves? We need our 
buildings to be
restorative.?
Person B: ?LEED can't save us from ourselves. LEED, as a 
tool, can
engage the market in transformation. That transformation is 
about
people. It is not about LEED credits.?
Person A: ?You're missing the point. We have to be tougher. 
We have to
go beyond.?
Person B: ?No, you're missing the point. We have to find 
ways to engage
a market that has never thought about these issues before.?
Persons A and B: ?Let's find a way to do both.?

These documents 
<http://lists.usgbc.org/t/725549/8700478/439/0/> try to
do just that. They incorporate new science and reflect a new
understanding of the priorities of our world. They 
synthesize the
countless days and nights of conversations, thoughts and 
ideas that have
been exchanged since the inception of LEED and then build 
bold action
steps around them.

It's a response of big ideas: a restructuring of the system 
that allows
it to be more nimble; a mechanism for incorporating 
bioregional issues;
a framework that supports rapid response to changes in the 
market and in
our environment; a process for introducing the new 
technologies that
support those changes.

You won't see the full impact of these ideas until you see 
how it all
fits together with the new LEED Online and the certification 
process,
but these shifts allow us to begin to address how human systems
integrate with natural systems. Some of the changes are 
purely technical
and some provide a platform for a new direction that will 
dramatically
alter how we launch our collective concerns and common goals.

Provided here 
<http://lists.usgbc.org/t/725549/8700478/439/0/> are
redlined changes to the rating systems, new scorecards and a 
framework
for the introduction of regional credits, along with background
documents that can help you understand how we got here.

You are being asked to fully engage as a participant in this 
discussion
and tell us what you think. I, personally, can't wait to 
hear what you say.

Yours,
Scot Horst

Hello All,
 
I know that this question has been asked on here before, but in looking through past archives I found that several of the website links either did not exist any longer, or that the weather data I was searching for was not available. If anyone knows of a good link for finding Dubai weather data, I'd appreciate your feedback.

Dear All,
I am trying to simulate a 60000 sq ft office building located in Houston, in eQuest that has packaged air cooled DX units and electric heat. It is a 3 story building and there is one unit on each floor. The proposed has been simulated with a system per floor.
The baseline equipment is packaged rooftop heat pump. It has been simulated with a system per zone.The percent of hours not meeting the throttling range are 14.9%.
When adding more core zones, the % of hrs is in the range of 32%. The core zones are undercooled, and so on adding more core zones and more units for those - the % of hours are increasing, not decreasing.
Please advise.
Thanks,
Ruju.

The eQuest library contains a curve set for an air-cooled scroll chiller. There is no indication if this represents multiple compressors or not, but if you compare the EIR-fPLR curve outputs w/other chillers you might be able to tell. These curves would be selected from the custom curves list in the chiller window / performance curve tab in eQuest, then from each drop down, "library" -> "chiller," after which the curve appears. 

Otherwise the multiple-compressor "reciprocating" chiller curves might provide a reasonable representation of typical scroll chillers, at least w/o the effort of making custom curves. These are selected by eQuest automatically when the user selects the "type" & compressors/ckt from  the main chiller window. Check the default minimum cycling and hot gas bypass ratios.

Hello All,

 

I am in the planning stage of modeling a campus boiler plant. I have two
questions as follows:

 

1)       ASHRAE/LEED require a minimum process energy of 25% of the
total building energy. I am predicting that my plant (15 boilers plus
pumps etc.) process load will be 95% of my buildings energy use if not
more. Is there a way to reduce the process energy use of the plant for
energy modeling purposes other than an exceptional calculation method? 

2)       Is this a situation where I could perform an exceptional
calculation and compare a "standard" boiler plant to the high efficiency
one that is being installed?

 

Thanks in advance for your help.

Dear Seth,

 

What makes you think that process loads must be a minimum of 25%?  As I
understand process load, there's often NO such load in a building... and
I did not think that there was any requirement to model it if it did not
exist.

 

Got a paragraph number in 90.1 which refers to that?  (I cannot find
one.)

Message-ID: <001501c8ba7f$d498dd60$0a00a8c0@LakeWaubesa>

SIM List,

 

We are modeling a GSHP system in eQuest.  After selecting the options in the
wizard and running the model we noticed that the space heating was quite a
bit lower when compared to a VAV system for the same project.  

 

We then went into detailed mode and started to look into what performance
curves the heat pumps had defaulted.  It seemed that the default part load
curve (HEAT-EIR-FPLR) that eQuest selected, seemed very aggressive.  It is
my understanding that the heat pumps cycle on and off when needed, and when
they cycle on and off they operate at 100%.  So, should the part load curve
be changed to be 100%, (ie it shouldn't have a part load curve)?  Or should
we be looking at something else.

 

Thanks,

Two things could be throwing off your comparison.

Not knowing what your baseline heating system is, the ground source heat pump will have a lower heating energy usage compared to conventional systems at the building line (electricity used at some COP compared to 80%-90% boiler/furnace or electric resistance heat at 100%).  Relative costs of each depending on your location.

Also the VAV system may have reheat where the zonal system will only be providing heat to meet the loads.

David

Also, several manufacturers have started using dual stage compressors giving
them part load ability.

SIM List,

 

We are modeling a GSHP system in eQuest.  After selecting the options in the
wizard and running the model we noticed that the space heating was quite a
bit lower when compared to a VAV system for the same project.  

 

We then went into detailed mode and started to look into what performance
curves the heat pumps had defaulted.  It seemed that the default part load
curve (HEAT-EIR-FPLR) that eQuest selected, seemed very aggressive.  It is
my understanding that the heat pumps cycle on and off when needed, and when
they cycle on and off they operate at 100%.  So, should the part load curve
be changed to be 100%, (ie it shouldn't have a part load curve)?  Or should
we be looking at something else.

 

Thanks,

Does anyone have or know of a process for documenting an Exception

previous threads and several people have mentioned the process, but I 
would greatly appreciate any info regarding documentation for LEED

Usually when you specify a heat pump system, the cooling compressor type is
specified as single speed (under airside HVAC, Cooling, Unitary Power).  I
believe that the part load ratio is based on how often the compressor cycles
over the hour simulated.

Also, even though the system is PVVT, default minimum airflows are given at
a ratio of 1.

The simulation time step in DOE2 is 1 hour and heat pumps won't run all
the hour if you are in part load conditions; so they don't operate at
100 %.

As during the hour, they cycle many times, there are losses and you need
the curve HEAT-EIR-FPLR for that.

Message-ID: <F94102E3F5278A41AE61586593CB4844028FA39F@sv04005.rmf.com>

Hello all,

I am performing an energy model on a central energy plant in Florida and
this is the situation.  I have modeled it for one chiller, pump, and
cooling tower but actually it has 3 primary CHW pumps, 2 secondary, 3
cooling towers, and 3 chillers.  I have one AHU and two FCU's all three
have electric reheat and on the chilled water loop.  I have an already
calculated process load of the building by the electrical engineer so
therefore I don't want to account for the same process loads more than
once.  I've have metered the building as EM1 and the chiller, pump, and
cooling tower as EM2.  I'm stumbling on how to run the process load of
EM2 without having count towards the total energy consumption.  ASHRAE
90.1 states that 25% of the buildings process load has to be used in the
proposed design and I'm trying to account for that.  I ran a simulation
and it attached for anyone's viewing pleasure.  I'm trying to lower the
space cooling, ventilation fans, and pumps &aux and to eliminate the
heat rejection from the cooling tower(s).  If anyone could give some
advice I would greatly appreciate it.  Thanks.

I am modeling a data center which consists of 5 attached buildings. There is
one central chiller plant and all AHUs, CRACs are cooling only (w/ chilled
water coils).

 

Central plant has 4 centrifugal and 3 direct fired absorption chillers. I
completed the model with DD wizard. But I can't define the base case chiller
run logic into the model. Building operators run absorption chillers during
the summer peak periods and doesn't let more than two electric chillers to
come online. They don't run the absorption chillers outside the summer
months. e-Quest is running absorption chillers all the time.

 

How can I enter the base case chiller run schedule into the model.

 

Thank you in advance for your help.

You will now enter the magical world of Detailed Interface, never to

Without taking the time to spell it all out (see DOE-2 Help in the

chillers (gas or electric in any order or bunches you choose), and
LOAD-MANAGEMENT to tell eQuest what times of the year to run each

                    "Expectations and realities: building performance in

                    the age of consequences"

Simulation has proved invaluable in helping designers to choose between
options.  It has been less good at predicting actual outcomes,
particularly for energy use in commercial buildings.  There are many
reasons for this.  The utility meters measure all the energy used,
simulations usually don't account for all the various end uses.
Simulators expect buildings to work in accordance with design intent,
usually discrepancies arise.  Buildings are tending to get more
complicated, but complication gets in the way.  Intelligent controls
often have hidden overheads and confuse occupiers and management.

Until now this credibility gap hasn't mattered much: energy was cheap,
few people measured in-use performance, and peak oil and climate change
were somewhere over the horizon. But buildings are now in the frame and
politicians and the public expect new buildings will automatically
perform radically better than older ones.  Not necessarily!  How can we
change the process, set stretching but realistic targets, and manage
expectations through to a satisfactory completion, and learn from the
process?

Bill Bordass is currently visiting LBNL from the UK, to provide some
input to work on building energy performance reporting and benchmarking.
Initially a physical chemist, he joined the A&E firm RMJM London to work
on technical support and user requirements, and became responsible for
developing its in-house environmental engineering team.  In the 1980s he
set up his own business, doing strategy, monitoring, and
troubleshooting, including reviewing the performance of low-energy
buildings and technologies for government clients and preparing
benchmarks and technical guidance.  He was responsible for the survey
methods in the Probe series of published post-occupancy evaluations and
has has recently been working on building energy certification in the UK
and Europe.  He is also research director of the Usable Buildings Trust,
a not-for-profit organisation that promotes better building performance
through understanding what actually works, see

Hi everyone,



I?m trying to model a ground source heat pump system in eQUEST using a
Water Loop Heat Pump system attached to a ground source heat exchanger.
The system seems to work fine during occupied hour but it just can?t meet
morning warm-up loads.  I?m doing a systems energy analysis for our local
energy code compliance and there is a mandatory night setback of 55 ?F
from 70 ?F in heating.  During winter months the system doesn?t seem to be
able to jump from 55 ?F to 70 ?F space temperature in less than 1-2 hours.
I?ve double checked the fan schedules and the system is allowed to come on
during this time.



Does anyone have any suggestions for getting the system to meet these
unmet load hours?

Message-ID: <A6D2CA56F188534E9C3AA144D5305BDC046565A3@pae-mail.pae.com>

SIM List,

                I have run into a situation where I am able to get
negative energy use under cooling by specifying a cold water reset
schedule for my chiller (Type: Electric Screw). I am using eQUEST 3.61e,
the chiller has a part load curve specified as well.

Is this a valid and if so, how?

 

Thanks

I?ve never used an optimum start schedule before.  I tried inputting the
-999 flag in the schedule but without much luck.  It reduced the number of
load hours from around 1100 total to 800, but did not eliminate the
problem.  So far I?ve found that increasing max zone entering temperature
and increasing the supply cfm lowers the unmet load hours, but I?m afraid
of increasing the energy use unnecessarily.  I?ve got the same building
using a different system to meet all of its unmet load hours with similar
CFM and btu-h heating/sf.

Hi everyone,



I?m trying to model a ground source heat pump system in eQUEST using a
Water Loop Heat Pump system attached to a ground source heat exchanger.
The system seems to work fine during occupied hour but it just can?t meet
morning warm-up loads.  I?m doing a systems energy analysis for our local
energy code compliance and there is a mandatory night setback of 55 ?F
from 70 ?F in heating.  During winter months the system doesn?t seem to be
able to jump from 55 ?F to 70 ?F space temperature in less than 1-2 hours.
I?ve double checked the fan schedules and the system is allowed to come on
during this time.



Does anyone have any suggestions for getting the system to meet these
unmet load hours?

Try putting in more heat exchanger capacity in the ground. Morning warm-ups are always a "bear" anyway.

Message-ID: <cdf76d820805220910h6939a232o9d23b67065da9e96@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

For benchmarking a building's energy performance, I understand that Target
Finder helps with proposed designs and portfolio manager helps with existing
buildings.

Is the set of background information against which a building in question is
benchmarked same for both the processes? If one needs to do a quick and
dirty calculation for an existing building even before officially starting
work on a project, would it be acceptable to run the existing building
utility information via target finder to see where it stands in relation to
regional average and in terms of energy star score? (I ask this because
setting up a project in portfolio manager takes considerable time).

I understand that the basis of both EPA ENERGY STAR programs 
is the same DOE database of existing buildings called CBECS. 
I also believe that EPA tries to keep the two programs 
consistent since they are meant to be used on the same 
building during design and then during occupancy.

I would give Portfolio Manager a try. I used it extensively 
a few years ago and it does not really take that long to set 
up and it sounds like what you really want.

Robby,

 

This is a typical, real world issue with heat pumps.  We typically advise
owners not to use an aggressive night setback (more than 2 or 3 degrees)
because of this exact problem.  We usually have a control sequence put in
place that limits the night setback if the outdoor air temperature falls
below a certain level (say 30 degF). Can you apply for a variance under the
local building code? If this is how the building will be operated in real
life with a 15 degree setback, you will probably get too cold complaints
from the occupants.

 

One way around the modeling problem would be to use perimeter baseboard in
the model.  I would set it to electric, and schedule the baseboard to only
to be available during the morning warm-up period.  It shouldn?t add too

Subject: [Bldg-sim] eQUEST GSHP Unmet Load Hours

 

Hi everyone,

 

I?m trying to model a ground source heat pump system in eQUEST using a Water
Loop Heat Pump system attached to a ground source heat exchanger.  The
system seems to work fine during occupied hour but it just can?t meet
morning warm-up loads.  I?m doing a systems energy analysis for our local
energy code compliance and there is a mandatory night setback of 55 ?F from
70 ?F in heating.  During winter months the system doesn?t seem to be able
to jump from 55 ?F to 70 ?F space temperature in less than 1-2 hours.  I?ve
double checked the fan schedules and the system is allowed to come on during
this time.  

 

Does anyone have any suggestions for getting the system to meet these unmet
load hours?

Hi everyone,

I've been working on a model of a school for quite a while.  What has me stumped is how to model demand control ventilation.  When I add DCV via the parametric run screen my gas load drops by 50%.  It just doesn't seem possible that I would get that degree of savings.  My base system is Packaged VAV with hot water reheat.  I've included perimeter radiation but have the program sizing it.  Has anyone else ever run into this and if so how have you resolved it.  Thanks in advance for your help.

I'm curious - with the simplified glass model does eQUEST calculate the variable reflectance as a factor of the incident angle? (It was my impression that it did this only with the detailed option).

Josh,

 

Those are the numbers Equest uses.  You need to adjust (de-rate) your
proposed assembly numbers ("NFRC 100: Procedure for Determining Fenestration
Product U-Factors" is a good source). You can back the glass conductance
(and shading coefficient?) out using this procedure.

 

Good luck.

 

-Jon

  I apologize if this has been discussed before, but I couldn't find it in the archives.

  Is there a way to rotate the camera view of the 3D model in eQuest (detailed mode)?  

  Or does the model always set up the 3D view so that you're looking at what would be considered the "plan south" view of the building based on the X,Y coordinates entered for the floor polygon vertices?

  Thanks!

Will the glass-conductance conversion method give the "assembly"
U-value?  I thought assembly U-value included the frame.  Also, what
would you do to get the assembly SHGC?

 

Why not just pick an existing glass type code after finding one that
most closely matches the desired assembly U-value and assembly SHGC?  I
can usually find one that is close to, if not exactly the same as, the
required values.  The best match I see from the DOE glass library for
U=0.57 and SHGC=0.39 is GTC 6840 - Double Pilkington Arctic
Blu/Air1/Clr6.

 

Select "Create another Glass Type Code" by right clicking on an existing
code in your component tree.  Then "Load Component from Library" and
pick 6840.  Then change the properties of the affected glass types to
reflect the change in glass type code (above the glass type codes as
listed in the component tree).

I'm to the point in an Energy Model where I'm changing my 'Proposed

Message-ID: <B48F2F9E06614945A93A1D0C1929146CB21D6D@DHOST001-36.DEX001.intermedia.net>

All,
I am simulating a building which has three water-cooled centrifugal
chillers and one loop-to-loop heat pump. The baseline building has three
equally sized cent. chillers. I am seeing an increase in cooling energy
for the system of about 18%. eQUEST is also crashing about every third
run even though the only changes I am making are to the capacity ratios.
Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Details: 
The centrifugal chillers are connected to a condenser water loop with
cooling tower and the chilled water loop with a CHW temp of 44F.  
The loop-to-loop heat pump is connected to a lake/well loop with high
and low temps of 110 and 30.  It provides heating to a separate lower
temperature hot water loop at 130F and CHW to the main CHW loop at 44F.

The engineer has sized the proposed system for 225 tons on the ground
loop/loop-to-loop heat pumps, and 450 tons split between the other three
chillers.  I applied capacity ratios for all four pieces of equipment to
split the loads accordingly.

The loop-to-loop is running for most of the hours between 10 and 30%
part load even if I size the heat pump well below its maximum capacity.

Thanks in advance,

Sam

Since the glazing needs to be modeled as an assembly, you also have to
verify the correct frame conductance is being used.  This value is found in
the detailed edits under the window details.  

 
Frame Conductance= 1 / [(1/u-value) - 0.197] 

 

So, by example, if the ASHRAE 90.1 fenestration assembly u-value = 0.57, the
frame conductance should = 1/ [(1/0.57) - 0.197] = 0.642 

 

When this is used in conjunction with the correct glass conductance (as
previously described), the output file will give the proper u-value averages
on the LV-D report.

Will the glass-conductance conversion method give the "assembly" U-value?  I
thought assembly U-value included the frame.  Also, what would you do to get
the assembly SHGC?

 

Why not just pick an existing glass type code after finding one that most
closely matches the desired assembly U-value and assembly SHGC?  I can
usually find one that is close to, if not exactly the same as, the required
values.  The best match I see from the DOE glass library for U=0.57 and
SHGC=0.39 is GTC 6840 - Double Pilkington Arctic Blu/Air1/Clr6.

 

Select "Create another Glass Type Code" by right clicking on an existing
code in your component tree.  Then "Load Component from Library" and pick
6840.  Then change the properties of the affected glass types to reflect the
change in glass type code (above the glass type codes as listed in the
component tree).

GLASS-CONDUCTANCE


The conductance of the glazing, excluding the outside air film coefficient.
The conductance given in glass manufacturers' data sheets usually includes
the outside air film resistance for a wind speed of 7.5 mph (summer) or 15
mph (winter). Table 10 <javascript:TL_5625.HHClick()>  can be used to obtain
the corresponding value of GLASS-CONDUCTANCE. For example, if U(7.5 mph) =
0.64 Btu/ft2-hr-F, then GLASS-CONDUCTANCE = 0.79 (by interpolation). For
U-values of different glazing types, see manufacturers' data sheets or the
ASHRAE 1989 Handbook of Fundamentals, p. 27.16-17.

All-

I'm looking to use "if statements" within DOE2.  For example, I'm trying to
input a specific LPD based on the type of lighting schedule that is
specified.  Ideally, I would like to couple multiple if statements together
but I can't even get this one to work:

{if(#L("LIGHTING-SCHEDULE")=Classroom InstLt Sch)
then 1.2
else 0
endif}

Any ideas on how this could work?

Thanks,

(I'm not an Equest user, so, my question is strictly coming from?a glazing and window assembly composite U-value standpoint).??
I don't see how there can be a single formula?to characterize the frame conductance.? Wouldn't the conductance of the frame be a function of the frame materials and construction....i.e. if it is insulated, thermally broken, wood, metal, pvc.....etc?

When the assembly u-value of the glazing system (window + frame) is
determined, the frame properties you described are taken into account.  The
equation below is just to convert all of this to something that eQuest will
use...
 
In the baseline case, ASHRAE 90.1 stipulates what the assembly value needs
to be.  For the actual design, an assembly value will need to be determined
using real frame data and center of glass u-values.  Check out LBNL's Window
5 software for more info.

(I'm not an Equest user, so, my question is strictly coming from a glazing
and window assembly composite U-value standpoint).  
I don't see how there can be a single formula to characterize the frame
conductance.  Wouldn't the conductance of the frame be a function of the
frame materials and construction....i.e. if it is insulated, thermally
broken, wood, metal, pvc.....etc?

Since the glazing needs to be modeled as an assembly, you also have to
verify the correct frame conductance is being used.  This value is found in
the detailed edits under the window details.  

 
Frame Conductance= 1 / [(1/u-value) - 0.197] 

 

So, by example, if the ASHRAE 90.1 fenestration assembly u-value = 0.57, the
frame conductance should = 1/ [(1/0.57) - 0.197] = 0.642 

 

When this is used in conjunction with the correct glass conductance (as
previously described), the output file will give the proper u-value averages
on the LV-D report.

Will the glass-conductance conversion method give the "assembly" U-value?  I
thought assembly U-value included the frame.  Also, what would you do to get
the assembly SHGC?

 

Why not just pick an existing glass type code after finding one that most
closely matches the desired assembly U-value and assembly SHGC?  I can
usually find one that is close to, if not exactly the same as, the required
values.  The best match I see from the DOE glass library for U=0.57 and
SHGC=0.39 is GTC 6840 - Double Pilkington Arctic Blu/Air1/Clr6.

 

Select "Create another Glass Type Code" by right clicking on an existing
code in your component tree.  Then "Load Component from Library" and pick
6840.  Then change the properties of the affected glass types to reflect the
change in glass type code (above the glass type codes as listed in the
component tree).

GLASS-CONDUCTANCE


The conductance of the glazing, excluding the outside air film coefficient.
The conductance given in glass manufacturers' data sheets usually includes
the outside air film resistance for a wind speed of 7.5 mph (summer) or 15
mph (winter). Table 10 can be used to obtain the corresponding value of
GLASS-CONDUCTANCE. For example, if U(7.5 mph) = 0.64 Btu/ft2-hr-F, then
GLASS-CONDUCTANCE = 0.79 (by interpolation). For U-values of different
glazing types, see manufacturers' data sheets or the ASHRAE 1989 Handbook of
Fundamentals, p. 27.16-17.

Convert your GLASS-CONDUCTANCE to come up with the appropriate U-Value.

See the attached for an ASHRAE window I did.

Why didn't you start with the ASHRAE run as Base, rather than the Proposed

I'm to the point in an Energy Model where I'm changing my 'Proposed Model'
to my 'Baseline Model' and I'm having issues changing the window data.  For
the ASHRAE 90.1 region, the Assembly U value needs to be set to 0.57 and the
Assembly SHGC needs to be set to 0.39.where do I input these numbers??  The
only window data values eQuest is letting me change is Glass Conductance,

Thanks Brian-

aaahhh...I guess DOE2 doesn't read strings without using the 'SymIndex'
keyword and for some reason eQuest only reads the "LIGHTING-SCHEDUL" keyword
not "LIGHTING-SCHEDULE".

Thanks again for your help.

Brian's suggestion is a good one, but requires the use of global parameters.

This correction however will fit directly into your particular project:

if (#L("LIGHTING-SCHEDUL",0) ==
    #SI("Classroom InstLt Sch","SPACE","LIGHTING-SCHEDUL"))
then  1.2
else  0
endif

Things to note:
- DOE-2 keyword names are limited to 16 characters, hence the use of 
"LIGHTING-SCHEDUL" in place of your "LIGHTING-SCHEDULE"
- LIGHTING-SCHEDUL is actually an array of 5 individual schedule 
assignments, so we specify the optional second #L() argument of "0" 
indicating that we are interested in retrieving the first (0-based, not 
1-based) element in the list (which is the default).
- Use of the #SI() function so that we are comparing a symbol table 
index to another symbol table index.

Message-ID: <9E3464C4BE9E8447B2DEBFEB0E296F9B0CD8ACCA@FKENTERPRISE.FKUSA.ORG>

Hi, 

I have a question about the chiller EIR curve in eQUEST. In the
attachment, there are two curves of chiller EIR. One is the kWH/Ton
curve from chiller manufacture. One the normalized EIR curve from eQUEST
default. These two curves showed quite big difference when the chiller
PLR drops to 30% or lower. 

 

In my simulation, I used manufacturer data and this equation to
calculate the EIR, and then normalized the EIR to get the curve. 

Cooling EIR = 0.941 * (1/(SEER/3.413))

 

Because about 20% of the chiller hours ran at less 20% of PLR, using two
different curves (calculated manufacturer curve and eQUEST default
curve) caused huge difference of chiller electricity consumption. So my
question is which curve is right for the chiller performance? Thank you
very much.

I have not spent much time researching the eQuest EIR curve origins, but I have spent years performing chiller ratings and analyzing centrifgual chiller part load curves under many circumstances.

In my opinion, the CVHE curve is much more representative of what the energy use will be for (1) chiller operating, than the eQuest curve.  The nature of centrifugal chiller is, below 25% loading the kW/ton increases.  Basically, system inefficiencies, which are relatively minor compared to power of compression at higher loads, are a bigger percentage of work input (kW) at low loads.

If you have mulitple chillers, more information is needed to make a determination of what your part load efficiency would be.

It would be good to get feedback from someone more familiar with eQuest EIR.

SEER is calculated differently than water cooled chiller performance, so that could be a source for differences as well.

I hope this helps,
Regards,

Zeina,

Did you try to generate it by "Meteonorm" or some other weather generator
software?
I'm not an expert to say how far the generated weather information can be
reliable. But trough our last experiences we get some good results.
Here is the site: http://www.meteonorm.com/pages/en/meteonorm.php

Good Luck,
Mostapha

Folks,
Don't be alarmed. The two curves in Xu's .pdf do not represent the same dependent value on the y-axis. The DOE-2 EIR f(PLR)curves essentially output kW (EIR(f)PLR x design kW) not kW/ton. The conversion to kW/ton has been discussed in previous posts, but, essentially, the "EIR"(kW) needs to be divided by the PLR (load, tons) to get kW/ton. The Trane curves probably include some condenser water reset, so a combination of DOE-2 curves would be needed to produce comparable outputs.

I have not spent much time researching the eQuest EIR curve origins, but I have spent years performing chiller ratings and analyzing centrifgual chiller part load curves under many circumstances.

In my opinion, the CVHE curve is much more representative of what the energy use will be for (1) chiller operating, than the eQuest curve.  The nature of centrifugal chiller is, below 25% loading the kW/ton increases.  Basically, system inefficiencies, which are relatively minor compared to power of compression at higher loads, are a bigger percentage of work input (kW) at low loads.

If you have mulitple chillers, more information is needed to make a determination of what your part load efficiency would be.

It would be good to get feedback from someone more familiar with eQuest EIR.

SEER is calculated differently than water cooled chiller performance, so that could be a source for differences as well.

I hope this helps,
Regards,

Hi, 
I have a question about the chiller EIR curve in eQUEST. In the attachment, there are two curves of chiller EIR. One is the kWH/Ton curve from chiller manufacture. One the normalized EIR curve from eQUEST default. These two curves showed quite big difference when the chiller PLR drops to 30% or lower. 
 
In my simulation, I used manufacturer data and this equation to calculate the EIR, and then normalized the EIR to get the curve. 
Cooling EIR = 0.941 * (1/(SEER/3.413))
 
Because about 20% of the chiller hours ran at less 20% of PLR, using two different curves (calculated manufacturer curve and eQUEST default curve) caused huge difference of chiller electricity consumption. So my question is which curve is right for the chiller performance? Thank you very much.

SimBuild 2008
 
IBPSA-USA will hold its third national conference from July 30 to August 1,
2008 on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley. The format
will be similar to the two previous SimBuild conferences held at the
University of Colorado at Boulder in 2004 and at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 2006.
 
The meeting is open to all, world-wide. Being near San Francisco, Berkeley
is a convenient destination for travelers from major cities in the U.S. and
in many other countries.  U.C. Berkeley is the oldest campus of the
University of California system, which also operates the well-known
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Lawrence Hall of Science, the
Space Sciences Laboratory, and the U.C. Botanical Garden. The city of
Berkeley contains a variety of neighborhoods with diverse character and
excellent restaurants.  The "Bay Area" is full of visitor attractions
accessible within 20 minutes, such as the city of San Francisco, scenic
mountains, and rich architecture (including the Frank Lloyd Wright Civic
Center).  Numerous wineries are within one hour travel to the Napa and
Sonoma valleys, where wine-tasting tours are available.
 
We look forward to welcoming you to Berkeley!

Message-ID: <483AD079.81E3.0083.0@deerns.nl>

Hello everyone,

I am a new user of VisualDOE 4 and I face the following problem. I find difficulties to design my HVAC system and the corresponded power plant. A system description follows:

1. A power generation system (power plant) that contains long thermal energy storage system in the ground, heat pump and gas boilers.

2. HVAC system consists of concrete core activation (radiant slabs), plus radiators for heating plus central air handling units with water coils (cooling/heating).

I saw some interesting suggestions for eQuest and I wonder how to treat the same problem in VisualDOE 4. Since the most subscribers are more experienced with the program, might have faced similar problems and have an idea to share with the rest on how to design them.

Message-ID: <3d2dfdf60805260720n660f0bcm63fb085a664680e@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sir,
Dubai has adopted a LEED standard for new buildings.  Your answer to my
previous question was very helpful.  But we have many other projects which
are entirely new construction and involve warehouse spaces with attached
offices.  From your previous answer, is it , is it safe to assume that all
warehouse areas are not LEED certifiable?  What if there are unconditioned
warehouse spaces with offices attached, the warehouse employing 10-50
people, the office areas employing 5-20 people.  The office areas are
conditioned spaces.  I'm concerned that some of the projects will not be
certifiable as a whole, or that separating the office spaces from the
warehouses from our LEED scope will not be acceptable.  Please provide
information as to whether such buildings are certifiable, or if only the
office spaces are certifiable, and whether LEED would accept separating the
warehouses from offices spaces from our LEED scope.

Thank you,
K.PAWAR

GLASS-CONDUCTANCE


The conductance of the glazing, excluding the outside air film coefficient.
The conductance given in glass manufacturers' data sheets usually includes
the outside air film resistance for a wind speed of 7.5 mph (summer) or 15
mph (winter). Table 10 <javascript:TL_5625.HHClick()>  can be used to obtain
the corresponding value of GLASS-CONDUCTANCE. For example, if U(7.5 mph) =
0.64 Btu/ft2-hr-F, then GLASS-CONDUCTANCE = 0.79 (by interpolation). For
U-values of different glazing types, see manufacturers' data sheets or the
ASHRAE 1989 Handbook of Fundamentals, p. 27.16-17.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] HP unmet hours
Message-ID: <22855.47618.qm@web51508.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

?I am simulating a 60000 sq ft office building, whose baseline is PSZ-HP. My proposed model has only 0.25 unmet hours but the baseline which is a water-source heat pump has 2.9% unmet hours. The building is located in Houston .
?
In the detailed mode, I tried to introduce a baseboard schedule for the morning hrs, but was unsuccessful. Could you please explain, how to introduce baseboard heating in the perimeter zones only and in the morning hrs. tagging to an existing schedule or creating a new one with end month as 12 and end day as 31 is not working out.
?
Can anyone tell me how to work with a baseboard schedule in detailed edit mode? 
?
Thanks,
Ruju.

Kevin,

I've modeled a SolarWall, aka "Solar Air Heating" or transpired air
collectors using RETScreen <http://www.retscreen.net/>.  They have a Solar
Air Heating module that is included in the RETScreen 4 download.  If you
don't mind modeling the SolarWall separate from the rest of the building,
then that should work pretty well.

You could also experiment with creating a space of type "plenum" with the
dimensions and properties of a solar wall.  If I were taking the
experimentation route, this is where I would start.

Yes, I have used RETScreen and understand a solar wall can be modeled within
it.  In fact, Conserval has already done this for us.  In considering
SolarWallR, all the air handlers have been sized down and when I enter in
the system inputs for capacity there isn't enough juice so I have to
incorporate solar air heating into this model.  Either that or autosize
everything to get 300 and subtract the retscreen model as an ECM.

 

So create a plenum for each air handler and then make all the plenum walls
Trombe-wall and just fiddle with it until it works, maybe.  I can spend a
minute on it and try.  Either way its modeling reality, right?  There should
be a lot more discussion on this.  Someone must have submitted an energy
model with solar air heating to USGBC using equest.

Undoubtedly the SolarWall will save energy, but due to the intermittency
of solar (especially at night!) I would be surprised if you could
actually downsize the heating capacity of your air handlers just by
adding the SolarWall.  Perhaps your model results are eluding to this.
It certainly deserves careful consideration.

They are the same concept, one applied to direct-fired gas heating in an air-handler, the other for boilers in a central heating system.

Hi Ramana,

 

There are a number of systems on the market, two brands that ive
researched recently are Fluke and FLIR.

We went with a camera that performs a number of functions for us eg
electrical safety, preventive maintenance and building energy losses.

It has a resolution of 1280 x 1024pixels, detector size of 160 x 120,
and a temperature resolution of 0.1C, stores >3000 IR / visible images. 

 

Field of view is critical also, especially for building heat and
ventilation losses - most cameras have a range of 23 x 17degrees

We have found it very convenient to use and we have trained all our
technicians and maintenance staff to use it.

 

Regards

Noel

Hey Ramana:

 

We are a building envelope consultancy and use infrared technology
regularly.  I strongly urge you to speak with multiple manufacturers (Fluke
and FLIR would be the two I would recommend) about your intended uses before
buying any camera from any source.  

 

There are many issues beyond just sensitivity and range and a variety of
features available.  Also, higher sensitivity and/or range are not always
better as they can cause meaningless static for some uses.  Some not often
thought about are whom all is going to need to access the images, from
where, what image data will they need to have available, and will they need
to be able to draft reports and/or edit images; what is your need to overlay
visible and Infrared imaging; and, do you need to be able to store just
images or images with all data over time?  There are many more.

 

If you speak with FLIR and Fluke you will get a sense of what you need in
terms of available features, they will be glad to give you specific unit
specifications once they have an understanding of what you need, and, you
can then let them and others (do a google and you will see there are more)
bid on your requirements both directly and through their local to you supply
chains.  Our last purchase we saved 25% by not buying direct but through
distribution and got the exact new unit with manufacturer warranty.  Go
figure.

 

Thanks and take care,

I am currently carrying out an ASHRAE 90.1 appendix G baseline model
which is showing me 350 unmet load hours. There is only one zone with
the unmet load hours, having looked at the Space temperature summary
SS-O for the zone it shows the hours are occurring before the fan
schedule switches on the fan, but my understanding of the unmet load
hours are only counted when the system is active.

 

If anyone has come across this previously and came up with a solution, I

I've been using IES for some time now and have gotten really good
experience with using FluxPro, Suncast, ModelIT and  Apache Thermal. I'm
unaware of any dedicated website to FAQ of IES. However if you were to
email IES directly in Scotland they will answer your question in regards
the temp reset. I think it's as simple as doing a profile that has a
"if" formula stating that if outside air is > x, result = 1.
 
IES has letters assigned to all parameters. It's a matter of asking IES
or reading the manuals to find what the letter representation for
"outside air" is.
I had to do something similar for daylight level. i.e.  if daylight lux
level in room is > 400, light load = 0. My formula looks like 
 
1.00-0.05*(144-29*IFH/(IGH+.001))*IFH
 
I done this some time ago, please don't ask what IFH, IFH stand for but
hopefully you understand what I'm getting at.
 
Shall you have any other question, please feel free to consult me.

Dear All,

 

I know that most of us here are eQuest or Trace users, but does anyone
know if there are any IES VE mailing lists on the WWW?  

 

Also for IES VE users: Was anyone able to model the chilled water and
hot water supply temperature reset based on outdoor temperatures as
required in the baseline case in ASHRAE90.1-2004 Appendix G? 

 

Thank you,

Jason, et al

As an ex-IES employee (Consultancy Manager England & Wales - a couple of
years ago) I'd be more than happy to see and contribute to an IES email
list.

I think I would be able to contribute fairly well as I know the software
well having used it for about 8 years now.  We also have other engineers in
our organisation that might be able to pitch in as well (my business Partner
is also another ex IES employee and we have 2 other accredited and
proficient users of the software).

Ronan - Regarding that profile stated - IFH stands for diffuse radiation on
the horizontal plane in W/m2 or BTU/h.ft2.  I would use that profile with an
element of caution though, as someone forwarded me an email from IES stating
that this was not correct.  It's the way it used to be done with the
software, but technically you have to work out the daylight level for each
room and then modify that profile accordingly and most people don't do that
step. Now that apache links with Radiance that is the way it is meant to be
done.

Paul

                    Technical Director, Usable Buildings Trust
                    "Expectations and realities: building performance in
                    the age of consequences"

Simulation has proved invaluable in helping designers to choose between
options.  It has been less good at predicting actual outcomes,
particularly for energy use in commercial buildings.  There are many
reasons for this.  The utility meters measure all the energy used,
simulations usually don't account for all the various end uses.
Simulators expect buildings to work in accordance with design intent,
usually discrepancies arise.  Buildings are tending to get more
complicated, but complication gets in the way.  Intelligent controls
often have hidden overheads and confuse occupiers and management.

Until now this credibility gap hasn't mattered much: energy was cheap,
few people measured in-use performance, and peak oil and climate change
were somewhere over the horizon. But buildings are now in the frame and
politicians and the public expect new buildings will automatically
perform radically better than older ones.  Not necessarily!  How can we
change the process, set stretching but realistic targets, and manage
expectations through to a satisfactory completion, and learn from the
process?

Bill Bordass is currently visiting LBNL from the UK, to provide some
input to work on building energy performance reporting and benchmarking.
Initially a physical chemist, he joined the A&E firm RMJM London to work
on technical support and user requirements, and became responsible for
developing its in-house environmental engineering team.  In the 1980s he
set up his own business, doing strategy, monitoring, and
troubleshooting, including reviewing the performance of low-energy
buildings and technologies for government clients and preparing
benchmarks and technical guidance.  He was responsible for the survey
methods in the Probe series of published post-occupancy evaluations and
has has recently been working on building energy certification in the UK
and Europe.  He is also research director of the Usable Buildings Trust,
a not-for-profit organisation that promotes better building performance
through understanding what actually works, see

Message-ID: <AF462D832A1F6E4E89B059E045A87E3A01514423@db-exch.darbeirut.com>

Dear all,

 

I am currently working on a project located at Saudi Arabia in Jeddah.

I found 2 different weather data files for this same location, the first
in the weather data folder of the 'ecotect' software and the second on
the EnergyPlus website that I converted into .wea to use in the 'weather
tool'. Both files display very different results in psychrometry, wind
analysis, solar position...

Where does this discrepancy come from?

Could you please suggest which one is more exact?

 

 

Regards,

Zeina Alwan
