Subject: [BLDG-SIM] eQuest Savings By Design
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200511301836.AA3651343pd80000881474@gard.com>

Has anyone modelled a Savings by Design project in eQuest?  If so, do you know what the assumptions are that are used to generate the T-24 equivalent building model?  I've found that my results are making some assumptions about the T-24 reference model that I cannot verify.

Any thoughts or help would be appreciated.

Hi folks,

I am currently modeling energy-saving mechanical retrofits for buildings 
using eQuest. The retrofits are modeled using parametric runs.

In the end, I want to have sitting in front of me a table with all of 
the savings broken up by AHU.

i.e.             steam savings     elec savings     gas savings     etc...
     AHU-1      ....                      ....                   ....
     AHU-2      ....                      ....                   
....                 
     AHU-3      ....                      ....                   ....

eQuest only displays savings by type of enduse.

Does anyone have any recommendations or strategies for obtaining this 
data? I should add that I have 80+ buildings to do, so I am looking for 
a method that is most efficient. One possibility is to do each of the 
AHU retrofits as a separate parametric run. However, this will lead to 
an overlap in savings. Since I have so many files to do, I am also 
considering writing a small C++ program.

thanks in advance,

 - Grant

typical house heating and cooling loadsForgot to add a couple of things about RESFEN:

  1. RESFEN contains all 239 TMY2 locations, so you should be able to find all the locations that you listed, except Astoria.
      For that, use Portland.
  2. RESFEN uses DOE-2.1E as its simulation engine. Each run will take a few seconds.

  Ian,

  You can also use the RESFEN program that is meant to analyze residential window performance, but has embedded in it prototypical building conditions for old and new vintage houses.  You can input the floor area, type of house (1-story or 2-story), and the window size and properties by orientation, and RESFEN will spit out the simulated annual and peak heating and cooling energy consumptions of the house.  Everything else (equipment specs, internal gains, etc.) are defaulted.

  You can download a copy of RESFEN from the LBNL Windows Group web site, but I don't have that handy. Just do a search either with your search engine, or with LBNL's internal search engine after going to www.lbl.gov.

    I'm interested in comparing my heating and cooling loads for a typical ~2000 ft2 home in the following cities:

    Jacksonville, FL       
    Charleston, SC 
    Memphis, TN    
    Astoria, OR    
    Pittsburgh, PA 
    Minneapolis, MN

    I was wondering if anyone could direct me to some good published data on loads for these areas.  I have already looked at the RECS data. I was hoping to compare to something else.

I am working with a client who has a small 2 storey (~4000 sqft) assembly building applying for LEED certification here in Upstate NY. The building is heating only, with energy recovery ventilators supplying 'neutral' or untempered air to the occupied zones. The lower floor has 3 radiant floor slab zones fed by a condensing boiler. The upper floor has low temp baseboard heat. 

Does anyone out there have any successful experience modeling radiant floor (slab)heating systems in a manner that USGBC will accept w/o resulting to using EnergyPlus..?

If so, could you please share your general approach, modeling software used, simplifications, and/or methodologies used? References are greatly appreciated. 

Thanks in advance for responses..

The performance of spandrel panels is very poor depending on the curtain 
wall thermal break.  The typical commercial curtain wall has a 3 mm 
polyvinyl strip punctured by bolts.  Depending on the size of spandrel 
panel, the overall R-value will be 50-70% less than the insulation 
value.  If the curtain wall has a good thermal break - 19 mm is typical for 
best systems, then you will see a reduction of about 35%.

For an accurate estimate of curtain wall performance (spandrel and glazing) 
see http://p10a.enermodal.com/WebFPlus/

Subject: [bldg-sim] Sunspace heat redistribution
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200511191049.AA4928703pd80000869736@gard.com>

Hi folks
   
We're currently working on a project in which we are trying to collect 
and redistribute passive solar thermal energy from an E-W 2-story sunspace 
(300' in length) to an adjacent main building.  For programmatic 
reasons, a typical passive approach, with mass storage and 
re-radiation, is not practical. 
   
Is anyone aware of existing projects that use simple air-air heat 
exchangers, or heat pump loops, to accomplish something like this at this 
scale?
   
Thanks,
   
Adam

If you use the design day routines that use the design day schedules for
internal loads then you can get reasonable airside design values, but they
do need to be reviewed.

If you have a design to work from then check your models CFM/SQFT by zone to
the design and adjust sizing ratios to match the design; if the sizing
ratios are greater than 1.2 then you need to start asking yourself questions
on why the two sets of figures are that different ...

Allowing DOE-2.2/EQuest to then autosize on parametric runs that may be
varying internal loads, envelope performance, shading, design temperatures
etc will give reasonable relative results for energy use and peak loads.
The key is in getting the base case model to be representative of the
building and well behaved and then reasonable results should follow.

Regards,
Graham

Vision panels should be modelled as windows, but the spandrel (opaque) areas will be external walls.  In this case your spandrel glass will be conductive and absorptive, but will not transmit as it isn't a window ... Spandrel glass is often colour back and will thus is usually very absorptive.  Layering of the external wal layers will be like any other construction, but be mindful of the aluminium bridging if there are no thermal breaks.

(G.3.1.2.2) and delta T (G 3.1.2.8) sections seem to be pretty key.

I was just having a similar problem using Appendix G. For the proposed
design you are to use the CFM of the design; for the base design you are
supposed to let eQuest autosize with a supply air reset delta T of 10 F.
eQuest still predicts much lower CFMs than the design engineer, so it
results in a net energy penalty.

Dear Sirs/Madams,

 

I am using eQuest to model an existing office zone with VAV system and
have performed a parametric run with different shading coefficient for
the glazing.  My problem is the large inconsistency when I model the
case with the VAV supply air fan design CFM defined and when I model the
case with the VAV supply air fan design CFM not defined.  For the run
that have the design flow rate defined, the fan energy (SS-L report) and
cooling energy (SS-A report) of the VAV system stays relatively constant
for different parametric scenario.  However, when the supply flow rate
is not defined, the fan energy and cooling energy varies significantly
with different parametric scenario (in which I think it is more
reasonable).  Does anyone have similar experience or comments on the
case.

Dear Martin:

I NEVER let DOE-2.1e or eQuest size my airflow. The
sizing program ALWAYS seems to under-size the fan,
based on the max space load conditions, which may or
may not represent ASHRAE design airflow conditions.

Stick with the Design sizing fans and fly with those.
You still may have the opportunity to use variable
volume to reduce airflows (and thus energy) during
many hours of the year.

But DON'T use DOE-2 or eQuest to size this stuff. My experience.

with eQUEST & Energy plus.

Dear users of EnergyPlus,

I have new questions for you.
I'm simulating a building with two thermal zones and I'm using
EnergyPlus with IDF-editor.

My desired outputs are:
- air temperature of each zone;
- relativ humidity of each zone air;
- sensible energy demand of each zone;
- latent energy demand of each zone.

Is it possible to get and to graphically visualize these outputs? How do you do?

Can someone help me?

Thank you in advance.

Vaibhav,

 

ASHRAE sponsored a research project on this issue:  RP-763 - "Impact of high
use automatic doors on infiltration" (final report in July 1996).  The
project included a field study of automatic door use in retail stores.  I
believe that the report can be purchased from ASHRAE's online bookstore.  As
Shruti pointed out, this topic is also summarized in the Handbook of
Fundamentals chapter on Ventilation and Infiltration.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Retail Store Infiltration

 

Hello Bldg_simers,

Can anyone point me to any re/sources for diversity factors or schedules of
air infiltration through doors for a large single retail store?

I am developing a DOE2 schedule and would like to have some practical
numbers to start with. If anybody has a method to determine such factors or
any relevant data-sets that they can direct me to that would be great.

Thank you all. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Vaibhav

The percentage of infiltration through a retail door could be determined by 
using ASHRAE fundamentals, chapter 26 (refer to page 26.25, 2001 
fundamentals). You can use the equations and the referenced graphs to 
calculate the flow.

The infiltration would depend on
1. the door area
2. the fraction of time it is open
3. and also an estimate of the number of people who would be using the 
door/hour (an approximation based on the retail space area being modeled 
etc). This factor would be the variant over the day and would determine your 
schedule.

(A vestibule might reduce the infiltration).

Hope this helps.

Christine,

You might also get some fruitful responses from the Society of Building
Science Educators (SBSE).  The SBSE members are mostly architects who are
very keen on sustainability and green architecture.  Their web site is
http://www.sbse.org.  To add your name to the listserv, contact Bruce
Haglund (bhaglund at uidaho.edu), or maybe you can add yourself at the web
site: http://www.lists.uidaho.edu/mailman/listinfo/sbse

Hello everybody,
 
In eQuest I notice that there are 3 different colors (red, blue, and green)
to differentiate methods of inputs. I have encountered purple. I am trying
to assign a zone to be unconditioned from conditioned. Every time I tried to
change the "Zone Type", component linkage window pops up saying I have to
remove the linkage before altering the zone type. I have gone through all
systems and found no linkage to this zone. Yet, I still can't change the
zone type. Has anybody seen this before? How do I fix this? Thank you for
your help and suggestions in advance. I appreciate all help and suggestions.

Bright Red    User value
Pink          User Expression
Bright Blue   User Default value or expression

These are user changeable, but we do not recommend color changes except to
allow brightness or shading differences between values and expressions.  Selections
are in the eQUEST.ini file (make a backup before changing anything)


To "break" the link on a component (it being LIKE'd to another same TYPE
component) right click on the component in the component tree, select define
link and change that assignment to - none -  ... you will then be prompted for any
resultant "required" values due to the linkage removal leaving required items
as unspecified.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Purple color than red, blue or green

In eQUEST, green inputs are default values, red are user entered
values and pink have user expressions defining them.  User expressions
are very useful - sort of like putting formulas into a spreadsheet
cell.  For example, I usually enter chiller EIR as 1/6.7 (where 6.7
would be the peak chiller COP).  You can go one further and define
global variables and then use the global variables in the user
expressions.

 

Purple fields are linked (as you observed) - that is, the element
(zone in this case) is linked to another and is getting its values
from that other zone.  I would suggest looking at the .inp text file
to determine which zone this zone is linked to.

 

I hope this helps.

Hi Albert-

 

Have you also changed the associated space to conditioned?  Both the
space and its zone must be designated the same way.  I usually delete
the zone, change the space to conditioned, then recreate the zone.

 

I have never seen purple inputs.

Hello everybody,

 

In eQuest I notice that there are 3 different colors (red, blue, and
green) to differentiate methods of inputs. I have encountered purple.
I am trying to assign a zone to be unconditioned from conditioned.
Every time I tried to change the "Zone Type", component linkage window
pops up saying I have to remove the linkage before altering the zone
type. I have gone through all systems and found no linkage to this
zone. Yet, I still can't change the zone type. Has anybody seen this
before? How do I fix this? Thank you for your help and suggestions in
advance. I appreciate all help and suggestions. 

 

Sincerely,

 

Albert Sitorus.

You can create new items in DOE2.2 by "linking" them to a previous item.
This way when you change the original item all the items "linked" to it
will also change.  equest shows linked items as purple.  Who ever set up
your model probably did so using a text editor and not the equest
wizard.  The easiest way to remove the link and make the change you want
is to go into the .inp file rather than trying to do it via the windows
interface.

You could also try using an economizer for the system. This would simulate
the opening of windows by occupants and keep temperatures down in the space.
Set the DRYBULB-LIMIT to a high value to keep the free cooling on in warmer
temperatures.

Hi Albert:

I am going to try to revert back to the netherworld of
DOE-2.

If the 2nd and 3rd floors have no cooling, the out of
throttling range should be meaningless cooling wise.
An uncooled area is at the mercy of the elements; ie,
solar, transmission, people, lights, etc..

Try increasing infiltration, which should be natural
to an apartment building opening its windows.

Don't get hung up on EVERYTHING DOE-2/eQuest says.
Think about what should REALLY happen, and adjust
inputs to create that scenario.

Chris,

First, what specifically were the errors?
(Look at the .ERR file created by EnergyPlus.)

If these are clear, then we may be able to solve
them by some minor editing.

In any case, you should get in touch with SquareOne

Hello everybody,

I am simulating 3D-model using EnergyPlus. For geometry, I used Ecotect.
But, after I simulate the exported model from Ecotect, EnergyPlus
shows an error message to say "fatal error and 2 warning ". I just
tested a smple 3-D box. I have no idea why there is an fatal error.
I would appreciate it if anyone who has encountered this type of
problem can know the solution.

Thank you very much in advance for your help. I appreciate any help or
suggestions.

Thank you again.

Sincerely,

Chris

For EnergyPlus, there are a number of tools.

You can create a building in CAD and export
to EnergyPlus using either the Green Building
Studio or the IFCtoIDF tool.

Two other tools are more oriented to design
and energy analysis:   ECOTECT and
DesignBuilder.  I recently saw an image of
a 20+ story building created in DesignBuilder.

Links to more information on these and other
tools for EnergyPlus is available here:

Dear all,

I have a new question. I'm using EnergyPlus with IDF-editor.
I should simulate an enough complex building.Which software could I
use for drawing a complex building?
So if I draw the building and then I export it in EnergyPlus I have to
insert the coordinates of the vertexes of the surfaces or it is not
necessary?

I have asked this question because if I have to insert the coordinates
of a complex building it is very expensive in terms of time.

Best regards,

Davide Marino.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200511161139.AA3921625pd80000864419@gard.com>

Hello everybody,
 
In eQuest I notice that there are 3 different colors (red, blue, and green)
to differentiate methods of inputs. I have encountered purple. I am trying
to assign a zone to be unconditioned from conditioned. Every time I tried to
change the "Zone Type", component linkage window pops up saying I have to
remove the linkage before altering the zone type. I have gone through all
systems and found no linkage to this zone. Yet, I still can't change the
zone type. Has anybody seen this before? How do I fix this? Thank you for
your help and suggestions in advance. I appreciate all help and suggestions.

 
Sincerely,
 
Albert Sitorus.

Subject: [bldg-sim] software for drawing a complex building
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200511160357.AA5706171pd80000863898@gard.com>

Dear all,

I have a new question. I'm using EnergyPlus with IDF-editor.
I should simulate an enough complex building.Which software could I
use for drawing a complex building?
So if I draw the building and then I export it in EnergyPlus I have to
insert the coordinates of the vertexes of the surfaces or it is not
necessary?

I have asked this question because if I have to insert the coordinates
of a complex building it is very expensive in terms of time.

Best regards,

Davide Marino.

Hi Albert:

I am going to try to revert back to the netherworld of
DOE-2.

If the 2nd and 3rd floors have no cooling, the out of
throttling range should be meaningless cooling wise.
An uncooled area is at the mercy of the elements; ie,
solar, transmission, people, lights, etc..

Try increasing infiltration, which should be natural
to an apartment building opening its windows.

Don't get hung up on EVERYTHING DOE-2/eQuest says.
Think about what should REALLY happen, and adjust
inputs to create that scenario.

Hello everybody,

I am simulating 3D-model using EnergyPlus. For geometry, I used Ecotect.
But, after I simulate the exported model from Ecotect, EnergyPlus
shows an error message to say "fatal error and 2 warning ". I just
tested a smple 3-D box. I have no idea why there is an fatal error.
I would appreciate it if anyone who has encountered this type of
problem can know the solution.

Thank you very much in advance for your help. I appreciate any help or

Thank you again.

Sincerely,

Depends on what you're trying to do. 

If you want "typical" schedules, then I'd suggest any of the ASHRAE papers from 1093-RP Diversity Factor study. This has 40+ hourly profiles from S,M,L building in selected climates. It also has a swell lit review. The ELCAP study also had some useful profiles for buildings in the Pacific Northwest. There are also profiles in the 90.1 1989 Standard If you want to roll-your own (I.e., if you have hourly data), you can get a copy of the final report of 1093 from Mike Vaughn at ASHRAE for $30. This comes with a spreadsheet w/macros that make the 24 hour profiles and makes schedule  snippets for import into DOE-2, BLAST, or EP. These should help with lighting, and receptacle loads, and can be used for occupancy profiles. 

If you have an HVAC system with ventilation air that puts the building in positive pressure, the prevaling wisdom is to shut-off the infiltration when the system is on, although I don't recall ever seeing any data to buttress this claim.   

Hope this helps.

If you mean schedule information used in DOE. You can first switch mode to
Detailed Data Edit, then in the component tree display window , you will
find annual schedules,week schedules and daily schedules for occupancy,
equipment and infilltration etc. They can be edited.

I have tried both with and w/o the night cycle cooling controls (for all 4
types, i.e stay-off, cycle on any, etc) before posting this question. But it

If the apartment units have no cooling, then you shouldn't experience any
hours outside of the throttling range because there will be no cooling
setpoint.  Make sure that the cooling temperature schedule (COOL-TEMP-SCH)
for all zones on the second and third floors are undefined.

Hello everybody,
 
I am modeling a 3-story building mixed-used LEED building. The first floor
is used as classrooms and retails. The 2nd and 3rd floors are used for
residential units. Most of the systems on the first floor are air-cooled
condensing unit with electric heat-pump heating, and the rest are exhaust
fan systems. For the 2nd and 3rd floors, the apartment units use unit
heaters  without any cooling. Corridors on these floors are served by
make-up air units with gas-fired heating. There is not any warning or error
when I simulate the model. 
 
The problem is that I can't reduce the "percent of hours any system zone
outside of throttling range" to an acceptable value. I have tried adjusting
air flow, throttling range, etc w/o achieving the desired results. I looked
at SS-O report and the problem is there are too many hours when the cooling
isn't satisfied for 2nd and 3rd floor. In other words, for all zones on 2nd
and 3rd floors there are many hours when the units are over 80 - 85F or even
above 85F. I also tweaked the fans night control cycle, infiltration
schedule, set-point temperature, and zone entering max supple temp but the
out of throttling range is still exceptionally high. 
 
I have no idea how to fix this error. Without cooling in these units, should
I not expect such large out of throttling range issues? Has anyone
encountered this kind of problem before? Can anyone share their experience
or solution? Has anyone done LEED model w/o cooling? I would appreciate any
response, idea or hints that would help solve this problem. I have described
the problem as clear as I can but I am sure there are things that I may have

You would need to follow the ECB method in ASHRAE 90.1 2001 or Appendix G of
ASHRAE 90.1-2004, depending on which LEED version you were using. In either
case you would need to model the base case building and the design case
building with a cooling system defined by the ECB or Appendix G for the base
case, even if there isn't one. This is unfortunate since buildings using
natural ventilation do not gain a benefit from an energy perspective. I have
heard that there is some lenience by the energy reviewers for naturally
ventilated buildings, but it may depend on which person is doing the LEED
energy review for the USGBC.

Are we sure this is a bug?  Sometimes simulation can make it a little too easy to get results.

I don't work daily with the evaporative cooling add-on but have modelled direct and indirect evaporative cooling systems and passive enthalpy wheels successfully in 2.2/Equest with results that I can believe.  The initial results were unexpected but by adjusting the various control types / parameters I was able to get the hourly results to match more or less my intent.

The DOE-2.2 Dictionary explains the numerous control keywords.

Regards,
Graham

  There is a bug in eQuest which apparently hasn't been fixed. It happens to me too except the heating usually goes way down. So maybe they haven't fixed it yet. I usually just model the building twice - once with a typical cooling system and then with evaporative and take the heating load from the building with the typical system, and the cooling load from the evaporative system. Has anyone else found a way around this?

  I am trying to model Add-on evaporative cooling in a building in Denver. Interestingly, even though the cooling energy goes down, there is an increase in heating energy. Why should that happen?

  If the apartment units have no cooling, then you shouldn't experience any hours outside of the throttling range because there will be no cooling setpoint.  Make sure that the cooling temperature schedule (COOL-TEMP-SCH) for all zones on the second and third floors are undefined.

    Hello everybody,

    I am modeling a 3-story building mixed-used LEED building. The first floor is used as classrooms and retails. The 2nd and 3rd floors are used for residential units. Most of the systems on the first floor are air-cooled condensing unit with electric heat-pump heating, and the rest are exhaust fan systems. For the 2nd and 3rd floors, the apartment units use unit heaters  without any cooling. Corridors on these floors are served by make-up air units with gas-fired heating. There is not any warning or error when I simulate the model. 

    The problem is that I can't reduce the "percent of hours any system zone outside of throttling range" to an acceptable value. I have tried adjusting air flow, throttling range, etc w/o achieving the desired results. I looked at SS-O report and the problem is there are too many hours when the cooling isn't satisfied for 2nd and 3rd floor. In other words, for all zones on 2nd and 3rd floors there are many hours when the units are over 80 - 85F or even above 85F. I also tweaked the fans night control cycle, infiltration schedule, set-point temperature, and zone entering max supple temp but the out of throttling range is still exceptionally high. 

    I have no idea how to fix this error. Without cooling in these units, should I not expect such large out of throttling range issues? Has anyone encountered this kind of problem before? Can anyone share their experience or solution? Has anyone done LEED model w/o cooling? I would appreciate any response, idea or hints that would help solve this problem. I have described the problem as clear as I can but I am sure there are things that I may have left out, please don't hesitate to ask me. Again, I am trying to get some ideas, hints or methods so I will provide as much info as anyone want in order to help me solve this.

    Thank you very much in advance for your help. I appreciate any help, hints or suggestions. Thank you again.

Dear Sasa,
   Our company developed a series of PV / Thermal components for TRNSYS 
some time ago. They perform an energy balance on the PV layer, the fluid 
channel behind the PV and take into account interaction between the air 
channel and the thermal zone behind that channel (if applicable). If you 
are interested in more information, you can visit 
http://www.trnsys.com/green.htm and look at the descriptions of Types566 - 569.
Kind regards,
   david

Sasa,

We have done it in the past. You can write your own model for PV-Thermal in 
FORTRAN as a new TYPE according to the Input/output schemes of TRNSYS. Then 
you have to recompile all TRNSYS files along with this new TYPE to get a 
new trnlib.dll.

Sorry I forgot to mention that I was using eQUEST to mode the add on
evap cooling.

 

Thanks

I am trying to model Add-on evaporative cooling in a building in Denver.
Interestingly, even though the cooling energy goes down, there is an
increase in heating energy. Why should that happen?

Hello,
   
  I am developing a PV thermal component (in Visual Basic or Fortran) that will be inserted into TRNSYS as a DLL.
  Did anybody do something similar? Could you give me some hints how to do it or where to read about it?
  What software would be more  recommended for programming Visual Basic or Fortran?
   
  Thank you for your time and consideration!

Thanks, Mike for the guidance. Picking up on what you've said, I have a
notion that curves for my heating system equipment might be the culprit,
since I'm also seeing heating loads not met in several zones.

I generally get the CURINV error from bad pump operation/specification.  In
this case with so many custom curves it's impossible to know what the
culprit is.  The X, Y and Z suggest that the curve causing the problem is
one of the bi-quadratics you have used.  Unfortunately resolving the problem
isn't easy.  You can do 1 of 2 things; 1- reset all the custom curves to
default curves and see if the problem goes away, if it does start adding
curves in one piece of equipment at at time until the error re-appears.
Then you know which curves are the culprit.  2 - reset curves back to
default one piece of equipment at a time untill the problem goes away.  If
you reset all the curves and still have a problem I would look at pumps,
chillers, boilers to see if you have specified any variables that may result
in unstable operation.   
 
Remember that for most pieces of equipment there are multiple curves that
describe operation and unless you create custom curves for each one of these
curves you can get really bad modeling results.

Greetings, fellow modelers:
 
In running an old eQUEST model, one that I did not develop so I'm not too
familiar with the strategies used to develop the inputs. I'm getting a
boatload of WARNING messages for curve fits along the following lines:
 
CURINV: Result out of limits for CURVE: 

92.768181********** 0.500614 0.005883 0.000216 -0.019132 0.000224 0.001061

X, Y, and Z: 23.077501 24.000000 4.939843 MMDDHH: 1 4 1

Can you guys advise me about what these messages mean and how to interpret
them: what is the curve number (92.76181), what are the next six values on
the first line, and what is that X, Y, Z all  about in the last line? [I'm
betting that last set, MMDDHH: 1 4 1, is the date/time: January 4, at 1 AM
in the morning.]
 
My model has quite a few curve fit assignments under the PERFORMANCE CURVE
folder of the Water-Side HVAC frame (33 to be exact). Also, these curves run
the gamut of linear, quadratic, bi-quadratic, and cubic. 
 
For all but two of the curves the MINIMUM OUTPUT and MAXIMUM OUTPUT values
are -1,000,000 and 1,000,000 respectively. There are two exceptions: the
range for the Variable Speed Drive is 0.10 to 1.00, the range for the
HW-Coil-Cap-fdT curve is 0.01 to 1,000,000.
 
Help?!

Actually, the modeling can't really be done in DOE-2.1e, since this would involve a system for the exhaust fan and make-up air fan., with the savings from the exhausting of make-up air vs conditioned air. However, you could get some idea of the AC and heating savings by running it with and without the exhaust, and then calc the extra fan by 2x the fan difference....something like that.

Subject: [bldg-sim] LEED Kitchen Exhaust Fan Modeling

Hi all,

 

I?m trying to simulate a teaching kitchen in eQUEST.  LEED Credit Interpretations Rulings have said that we can take credit for exhaust energy savings.  We have modeled our hoods as variable volume exhausts and put them on a typical use schedule.  ASHRAE 90.1 Section 6.3.7.1 only gives specifics for kitchen hoods over 5000 cfm (which we don?t have).  Am I to assume that we can model the hoods as constant volume in our baseline model?  The energy savings between the two seem somewhat unrealistic.  Has anyone come across this situation and do you have advice?

 

Thanks,

But what do you get as a result?  If it's only the stead-state conductance, then the dynamics of thermal mass, diffusivity, etc., which are quite important for walls, esp. heavy-mass walls, will be lost. There has been work done at Oak Ridge and here (LBNL) on modeling 2-D heat flows dynamically, and then creating either equivalent one-dimensional wall layers (the Oak Ridge approach) or equivalent one-dimensional response factors (the LBNL approach).

Under "Glass Type Properties" Component Details tab, glass layers and
emissivity values are listed. Glass layers are indicated from outside to
inside.
For DOE-2 library glass types, front and back emissivity is indicated.
Low emissivity value is always listed on surface 2 (back of outside
panel) independent of glass type.  Is this an error, as glass types
(such as 2663-2665) have low emissivity coating on surface 3; so low
emissivity value should be on front of glass layer in second row.

You obviously never "flew" DOE-2.1C on an PC-AT 6 Mhz.
Try 12 hour runs..and God help you if you screwed up..

THEN complain about run time...

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200511081119.AA1933781pd80000853556@gard.com>

Hello everybody,
 
First of all thank you so much for the responses. Although, I may have left
out some important info. These 3 systems are the same systems with different
capacities. I could make three different zones entirely, but it would effect
the simulation run-time at the end. Another reason is that these three
systems serves common areas which will have the same temperature set points,
controls, etc. To lump these three zones is a good way to cut down on
simulation run-time and set-up time. Last but not least, It is also
encouraged to lump the same systems together from training that my colleague
had in the past. However, please let me know if this practice is not
appropriate. If so, I will raise this question during eQuest training in the
coming week (11/18 in Portland). 
 
The area of this zone is small comparing to the entire building. I agree
with Bob, to add and average the EER/HSPF sounds like a fine method for a
quick and dirty simulation for one out of 10 zones. But if there are other
methods, I am still interested to hear them. Once again thank you so much
for the responses.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200511080859.AA5936234pd80000853359@gard.com>

Hi all,

 

I'm trying to simulate a teaching kitchen in eQUEST.  LEED Credit
Interpretations Rulings have said that we can take credit for exhaust energy
savings.  We have modeled our hoods as variable volume exhausts and put them
on a typical use schedule.  ASHRAE 90.1 Section 6.3.7.1 only gives specifics
for kitchen hoods over 5000 cfm (which we don't have).  Am I to assume that
we can model the hoods as constant volume in our baseline model?  The energy
savings between the two seem somewhat unrealistic.  Has anyone come across
this situation and do you have advice?

 

Thanks,

can you control three simulataneously operating

In-Reply-To: <MDAEMON-F200511072100.AA0033515pd80001138727@gard.com>
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200511080044.AA4427859pd80000852817@gard.com>

Hi Nicole:

Simple, simple, simple..

Unconditioned zones (in DOE-2 or eQuest) may be
assigned to ANY SYSTEM. But they must be assigned to
SOME SYSTEM (at least in DOE-2.1E). They just don't
contribute to the SYSTEM heating and/or cooling load.
Just ancillary electric or gas load. Like
OUTSIDE-LIGHTS. It could also be kitchen cooking load,
that doesn't add to internal load, but must be
accounted for somehow.

Also, if an unconditioned space abuts a conditioned
space, one describes the unconditioned space, then
attaches it (NEXT-TO) to the appropriate wall of the
conditioned zone. The time dependent heat tranfer rate
will add heat at the appropriate time to the
unconditioned space, and thus transfer the load to the
conditioned space.

Forgot if this is a DOE-2.1E or eQuest question....

Hello everybody
 Can you tell how you resolve unconditioned zones when simulation? Do you
arrange those unconditioned zones with their adjacent conditoned zones to a
same air system? Or group all those unconditioned zones to an individual air
system like SUM? Is there much difference in result ?
 Thank you for your help in advance!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200511071645.AA4540843pd80000852284@gard.com>

We need to model a water source heat pump system consisting of boiler, cooling tower with a "Heat Pump" equipped with fan, hydronic heating coil and a compressor for cooling.  Heat is taken from the water loop for heating through hydronic heating coils and heat is rejected into the same loop from compressors providing cooling.
"Heat Pump" heating mode - valve open to let water into the a hydronic heating coil.   
"Heat Pump" cooling mode - valve open to let water into the condenser for heat rejection from compressor.
 
Don't see any systems options for the DOE (HP) system that doesn't use the compressor for heating.
 
Any tips or hints of how such system could be modeled would be appreciated.
 
Thanks,
Peter

Hello everybody,
 
I have a question regarding multiple systems in one zone. I have a zone that
has 3 systems in eQuest. They all have different sizes therefore different
EER/HSPF. How do I solve this problem? One suggestion is to calculate the
EIR for each system and weigh the number to satisfy both systems. However, I
am not too sure how to explain this in a report. Has anyone encountered this
problem before? I would appreciate it if anyone who has encountered this
type of problem can share their experience. 
 
Thank you very much in advance for your help. I appreciate any help or
suggestions. Thank you again. 
 
Sincerely,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200511031515.AA1555328pd80000848136@gard.com>

Hello,

 

Has anyone ever looked at or designed a system where the cooling tower was
used for heat recovery? i.e. in most cases the exhaust from the building is
routed via an energy or heat recovery unit for energy recovery and in the
process the incoming outside air is tempered. This exhaust air could be
routed to the cooling tower air supply stream. The exhaust from the building
is nominally at 75 deg F and 50% RH which would make the cooling tower
operate efficiently during the summer. The downside to this is that it would
not work during the winter and also the exhaust air flow is generally a lot
smaller than the cooling tower cfm. Not sure if there are any code
restrictions to this sort of thing. 

 

Has anyone done any analysis on such a system?

Dear users,

I'm a new user of Energy Plus and I'm prooving to use the DesignBuilder Beta 
Version Interface. I'm not sure if I have to buy the interface yet, because 
of different causes:

a) I need to draw boundary walls. In TRNSYS there is a specific type of wall 
that allows that. So, if I have to simulate a single zone of a whole 
building, can I separe it with a boundary wall and specific the boundary 
temperature.

b) Is it possible to draw perimetral walls of different tickness?

c) Can I consider thermal bridges? How?

d) Can I use Design Builder to generate a file and only after to modify it 
directly in Energy Plus?

e) Have you another different (from Design Builder) and simple solution to 
use Energy Plus?

Is there someone who can help me? Thank's to all,

Alpana,
   TRNSYS 16 also has a series of fuel cell and related (alkaline and PEM 
fuel cells, power converters, electrolyzer, gas compressor, hydrogen 
storage, etc.). The components were developed by the Institute for Energy 
Technology in Norway. I am not sure whether anyone has implemented phase 
change materials in buildings in TRNSYS. Our firm recently developed a 
series of PV/PCM components - photovoltaic panels that include a layer of 
phase change material to damp the changes in cell temperature.
Kind regards,
  david

Dear Alpana,

Further to Jon's and Dru's responses, the focus of IEA/ECBCS Annex 42 is the
development and validation of building simulation models for predicting the
energy performance of residential cogeneration systems, with an emphasis on
fuel cells.  You can learn more about its ongoing efforts at
www.cogen-sim.net.

There is also a SOFC fuel cell in the latest release

purposes as the model continues to evolve within the
IEA Annex that it was developed in.

Hi,

How can one model fuel cells and phase change materials for buildings? Is
there a way?

I'd appreciate any help on this.

Mike,

 

Switching the units in WINDOW5 will not create the report in IP. The DOE2
reports from WINDOW5 are always created in SI units. eQuest will take care
of units conversion.

In Window 5 under the tools menu is an option for switching units.  Switch
to IP before running the DOE report and you should be all set for importing
into eQuest.

Dear bldg-sim members,

 

I came across the same problem when I tried to import glazing system from
window 5.  The file created by window 5 is in SI unit.  Thus when importing
to eQuest, the results were not correct.  Can anyone give suggestion on
that?  Thank you for your attention.

There is a generic fuel cell model in ESP-r which, depending on
the specific type of fuel cell you want to model. The fuel cell
component could be linked in with an electrical network of
ESP-r as well as the environmental system network so that the
co-generation can be tested under complex demand patterns. 
I know that Natural Resources Canada have been 
active in this area and might be in a position to assist with
such a model. Iain Beausoleil-Morrison at NRCan would be
a useful contact <ibeausol at NRCan.gc.ca>.

ESP-r can also accept descriptions of various
phase change materials. It is quite amazing to see
surfaces with phase-change layers taking a massive heat 
load with only a slight drift in temperatures. A good contact 
for this would be Dariusz Heim <darkheim at p.lodz.pl> to 
check to see whether the type you have in mind is already 
encoded and to get advise on setting up models.

In Window 5 under the tools menu is an option for switching units.
Switch to IP before running the DOE report and you should be all set for
importing into eQuest.

Dear bldg-sim members,

 

I came across the same problem when I tried to import glazing system
from window 5.  The file created by window 5 is in SI unit.  Thus when
importing to eQuest, the results were not correct.  Can anyone give
suggestion on that?  Thank you for your attention.

 

Regards

Hi,

 

How can one model fuel cells and phase change materials for buildings?
Is there a way?

 

I'd appreciate any help on this.

Is there a way to change eQUEST into metric units? I
can see the options under project properties in the
detailed interface but the pull down menu is not
activated.
