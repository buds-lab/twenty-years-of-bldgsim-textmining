Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200405281229.AA2954359pd80000183221@gard.com>

The responses to the previous below request 
came largely from vendor or government
agencies.


I am also interested in discussing direct 
customer experiences with wireless 
implementations -- including:

   .   Heating Controls
   .   Computers, networks.
   .   Printers
   .   Alarms

Let me know by email if you have 
something that you would like to share...


            * * * * * * * * 

I am writing an article on wireless building audits 
for a major energy publication. 

I would like to include a few experiences from others 
as sidebars in this article [rather than just using our 
own customers' experiences]. 

If you recently have implemented building-based 
wireless tools, *especially* audits/inspections/punch lists, 
and would like to share your experience for this 
article -- would you please contact me off-list? 


Thank you, 
~Bill

One minor addition to Brian's first "Ctrl-C" suggestion - this is specific to the 3-D display and does not work for the 2-D display.
And one other 3-D display option - again click in the background of the 3-D display view (so that this view receives keyboard inputs) and press "j".  This automatically generates a JPEG image and posts it into the project directory by the name "<project name> - 3d-#.jpg", where # is a unique integer, counting up from 1 to preserve previsouly stored images.  Also regarding the JPEG export - whatever portion of the construction/glass legend that overlays the 3-D diagram will also get stored to the JPEG.

I also second Mike's suggestion about changing the background color to white before storing and using these images.  The option to toggle the 3-D background color from balck to white is on the "3-D View Details" tab of the Project Data tabbed dialog.

The results summary reports can also be copied and pasted.  Right-clicking on a graph in the summary report gives the option to Copy the graph which can then be pasted as a bitmap.  Right-clicking on the summary report tables allows you to copy either the entire table or the selected cells and will paste them (parsed!) into Excel etc.

 

Hope this helps.

Use the Print Screen feature on your keyboard and then paste the result
into a picture editing program.  I use Photoshop.  If you change the
background to white first the pictures come out a lot better.

Hi Raquel,

There is no TMY, TMY2, TRY, DAT data for Dubai that i know of,

however, there is EPW data for Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates...about 100 Km west of dubai) 
that Ecotect can read in.

Does the air need to flow through the corridor, or simply across the
corridor from one set of classrooms to classrooms on the other side?  If
across, then the corridor fire enclosure can be the walls on each side and
the corridor ceiling (in other words, the corridor walls do not go floor to
roof; only floor to corridor ceiling).  Air can then flow over the top of
the enclosed corridor from one side of the building to the other.

If the air must flow through the corridor instead of over it, the problem is
much more difficult; if not impossible.  This technically makes the corridor
a duct, and may be subject to duct construction standards.  Also, the intent
of the code is that occupants and the fire department have an escape route
free of fire for one hour; additional restrictions may require that this
escape route be free of smoke for one hour as well.  You don't want to
violate the intent of the code, as public safety takes precedence over
potential energy savings.  (You also don't want to be sued in the event
someone dies in a fire!)  My understanding of the local requirements in my
area is that a fire-rated corridor CANNOT be used as part of an air supply
or air return.

Code requirements can vary from one jurisdiction to the next, and
interpretations of the same code also vary.  You should definitely meet with
the local plan checkers, and/or the local Fire Marshall to determine the
applicable criteria for your building; the earlier in your design the
better.

If you want to dust off your microfiche reader, two older articles, neither
of which is cited in the ASHRAE Fundamentals chapter, are:

"Air Infiltration Through Revolving Doors," Schutrrum, L. F., N. Ozisik, J.
T. Baker, C. M. Humphreys, No. 1760, ASHRAE Transactions Vol 67, 1961.

"Winter Infiltration Through Swinging-Door Entrances in Multi-Story
Buildings," T. C. Min, No. 1643, ASHAE Transactions, 1958.   (The professor
worked at Alabama Polytechnic Institute, since renamed).

The papers provide relationships to estimate losses as a function of number
of people per hour passing through the doors and as a function of building
height, among other things.

...or see the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals (2001), pages 26.24-26, which
summarizes the results of the same ASHRAE research project.

One of the difficulties of dealing with doors is the large difference in
leakage area between when they are open and closed and determining how much
of the time they are opened.

My first guess would be that a revolving door is easier to estimate because
there is always a seal and a relatively small amount of outside air would be
transferred by leakage or in bulk due to the rotation of the door.

Ahmad,

A significant portion of energy loss through a door is air leakage.  I am
aware of a study that examined this issue for automatic doors:   "Air
Leakage Through Automatic Doors," G. K. Yuill, Rebecca Upham, and Chen Hui,
ASHRAE Transactions, V106, Pt 2, 2000.  This might be a starting point.

Dear All,

     I have a case in which an owner of a building needs to know which type
of outside doors will be more energy efficient (i.e. which type is more
effective to reduce the load of the Air Conditioning system).

    He asked me about three door types: Automatic sliding doors, rotating
doors and hinged doors.

   So, can anyone provide me with a method to calculate the energy losses
through each type? or is there any study that has been made for such case?

Your help will be highly appreciated

Thanks & Best Regards

Ahmad,
 
A significant portion of energy loss through a door is air leakage.  I
am aware of a study that examined this issue for automatic doors:   "Air
Leakage Through Automatic Doors," G. K. Yuill, Rebecca Upham, and Chen
Hui, ASHRAE Transactions, V106, Pt 2, 2000.  This might be a starting
point.

David Yuill

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Energy losses through outside doors
 
Dear All,
 
     I have a case in which an owner of a building needs to know which
type of outside doors will be more energy efficient (i.e. which type is
more effective to reduce the load of the Air Conditioning system).
 
    He asked me about three door types: Automatic sliding doors,
rotating doors and hinged doors. 
 
   So, can anyone provide me with a method to calculate the energy
losses through each type? or is there any study that has been made for
such case?
 
Your help will be highly appreciated
 
Thanks & Best Regards

I would agree that infiltration is a guess at best and
go further in saying that it would be relatively easy
to stick a number in a base model that would represent
excessive infiltration in order to get unjustified
credit.  

Typical engineering practice these days is to maintain
a slight positive pressure during normal building
operation.  This aids in comfort by eliminating cold
drafts in winter climates and assisting in control of
moisture in wet ones.  Infiltration at worst should
thus only occur during unoccupied periods.  That said,
high-rise buildings often have enough stack effect
that this moderate positive pressure is overwhelmed on
the first floor with people opening doors, etc.  

It should be assumed that in new buildings, especially
those being considered for LEED credit, people will be
paying attention to the tightness of the shell during
construction.

Varkie,
 
If you review Addendum E of ASHRAE 90.1-2001 (available as free download
from ASHRAE website) it addresses these issues you are asking.  While
LEED has not officially adopted this addendum as a simulation
methodology it is my understanding that that is why it was developed.
If you follow the approach outlined in this document I don't think USGBC
will take issue with your simulation.  Please don't quote me on that, I
am certainly not trying to speak for USGBC.  
 
I have used the methodology several times and it provides clear guidance
on how to create the baseline model and the proposed building model.
Most importantly you can easily document your modeling assumptions so
that when questioned you can reference the methodology.
 
Good Luck,
 
Mike

The EA-TAG should also consider that the infiltration due to stack
effect in a high-rise building is affected by having entrances with a
vestibule and revolving doors.  

 

Can occupancy based lighting and occupancy based ventilation be
considered for LEED credits under "Optimize Energy Performance"?   How
should these options be modeled?  In DOE2 the design ventilation value
can be varied by using the occupancy schedule for the minimum OA
schedule.  Occupancy based lighting would have to be "on-off" depending
on occupancy = 0 or occupancy > 0.   This can vary with the space type
and it is difficult to determine for buildings zoned as perimeter and
interior only.  Can we assume say an average 5% off the lighting
schedule for installing occupancy based lighting controls?  How would
you model daylighting controls for LEED credits?  In DOE2 you can locate
the light sensor close to the window and assume it represents a
perimeter space with any depth.  Are there limits on lighting sensor
location and perimeter space depths, areas and volumes?  The ASHRAE
STD90 prescriptive standards are stringent in all categories of
envelope, lighting and mechanical systems.  From the responses I have
received so far, significant energy cost savings (such as 60%) can be
achieved with daylighting controls (not accepted by most energy codes),
renewable energy sources such as PV and GSHP, and thermal storage in
situations where there is a big difference between peak and off-peak
electric rates.  

 

I think that different types of standard building models should be
defined with case studies.  It is difficult to figure out the intent of
STD90 and to convert STD90 legal descriptive language into a base
prototype building model.  10CFR435 is more precise.  I think that the
"Energy & Atmosphere" section of LEED should be explained in more detail
and with examples.

Occupancy based controls require the modification of schedules and/or 
ventilation rates which is not allowed by the modeling protocols.

For LEED one can claim credit for these items by following Section 11.5 
Exceptional Calculation Methods in 90.1.  You have to do separate 
calculations and submit them for consideration by the review 
team.  Separate modeling runs can be an acceptable methodology as long as 
you explain the modeling procedure followed.  These are then subtracted 
from the original energy modeling like Renewable Energy.

Regarding daylighting modeling the review of LEED projects does not get to 
this level of depth.  We will not ask you the location of the sensor in the 
room.  We do use our experience to try and determine if the energy 
efficiency measures you have employed produce a reasonable savings.

For USGBC members you can join in some of the discussions of the EA TAG by 
signing up for the EA listserv.  Log in, visit your account and sign up for 
various committees.  Also check out the Credit Interpretation Requests 
(CIRs) where you can find many answers like the one regarding occupancy 
based controls I responded to above.

The EA TAG was also seeking new members very recently but I think the 
nominations/applications are closed.  The best way to have an effect on 
LEED is to get involved.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Infiltration: Standard versus Proposed Design

 

Right now infiltration reduction is not an eligible item for energy cost
reduction for LEED.  Infiltration rates must be the same in the proposed
and budget buildings.

My understanding is that the Energy & Atmosphere Technical Advisory
Group (EA TAG) of the USGBC is considering this issue with an eye toward
developing a modeling protocol.

I am aware of at least two projects that have applied for savings in
this area which have been put on hold (the LEED points were denied
pending further input from the EA TAG).  


As At 10:33 AM 05/19/2004, you wrote:



Can infiltration be considered in comparing standard versus proposed
design models using the ECB method and for LEED credits under "Optimize
Energy Performance"?  Typically we use the same criteria in both models,
but this is a particular case of a proposed double-wall building.
"10CFR435 Table 402.2.1. - Air Leakage for Fenestration & Doors Maximum
Allowable Infiltration Rate" provides standard model information for
federal buildings.  For example, the infiltration rate is 0.15 cfm/ft2
for fixed aluminum windows.  Can this be used for LEED standard design
and can a lower rate be used for double wall buildings?
 
The CFR table does not account for Heating & Cooling Degree Days as with
Table-B Building Envelope Requirements of STD90.  In my opinion, the
peak design infiltration rate should be varied from maximum in winter to
minimum in summer (typically zero for pressurized buildings) using a
schedule.  The maximum, of say 0.15 cfm/ft2, would apply to a cold
climate such as Chicago and it should be scaled down for warmer
climates.  Since DOE2 does not allow infiltration rates on the basis of
cfm/ft2 of wall or window area or cfm per lineal foot of window
perimeter, we create a typical perimeter space and convert the window
based infiltration rate to cfm/ft2 of space area or space air changes.
We then look at the results in "REPORT- LS-C BUILDING PEAK LOAD
COMPONENTS" of the DOE2 output to see if the infiltration load looks
reasonable (relative to the other loads) for the location and type of
building and make adjustments by trial and error.  Judgment and
experience is considered more reliable than theoretical mathematical
models.  The BEPS and BEPU reports in DOE2 should separate out the
infiltration loads from the heating & cooling loads.  Any comments?
 
Thanks for the comments and suggestions to using different utilities in
standard versus proposed design.  They were very helpful in making some
decisions here.  Most of the responses seem to go directly to the person
asking the question.

Is it the sense of the group that infiltration can be predicted well enough
in commercial buildings to take credit for energy savings in this area?  I
considered this issue a few years ago, and the literature seemed to indicate
that prediction was very poor, and that field work indicated that
infiltration would vary substantially, in the same building under similar
outside temperatures due to small differences such as a few windows or doors
opended differently, and that it was in most cases unclear what the
differences were due to.

Right now infiltration reduction is not an eligible item for energy cost
reduction for LEED.  Infiltration rates must be the same in the proposed and
budget buildings.

My understanding is that the Energy & Atmosphere Technical Advisory Group
(EA TAG) of the USGBC is considering this issue with an eye toward
developing a modeling protocol.

I am aware of at least two projects that have applied for savings in this
area which have been put on hold (the LEED points were denied pending
further input from the EA TAG).

buildings.  For example, the infiltration rate is 0.15 cfm/ft2 for fixed
aluminum windows.  Can this be used for LEED standard design and can a lower
rate be used for double wall buildings?
 
The CFR table does not account for Heating & Cooling Degree Days as with
Table-B Building Envelope Requirements of STD90.  In my opinion, the peak
design infiltration rate should be varied from maximum in winter to minimum
in summer (typically zero for pressurized buildings) using a schedule.  The
maximum, of say 0.15 cfm/ft2, would apply to a cold climate such as Chicago
and it should be scaled down for warmer climates.  Since DOE2 does not allow
infiltration rates on the basis of cfm/ft2 of wall or window area or cfm per
lineal foot of window perimeter, we create a typical perimeter space and
convert the window based infiltration rate to cfm/ft2 of space area or space
air changes. We then look at the results in "REPORT- LS-C BUILDING PEAK LOAD
COMPONENTS" of the DOE2 output to see if the infiltration load looks
reasonable (relative to the other loads) for the location and type of
building and make adjustments by trial and error.  Judgment and experience
is considered more reliable than theoretical mathematical models.  The BEPS
and BEPU reports in DOE2 should separate out the infiltration loads from the
heating & cooling loads.  Any comments?

Dear All,
 
     I have a case in which an owner of a building needs to know which type of outside doors will be more energy efficient (i.e. which type is more effective to reduce the load of the Air Conditioning system).
 
    He asked me about three door types: Automatic sliding doors, rotating doors and hinged doors. 
 
   So, can anyone provide me with a method to calculate the energy losses through each type? or is there any study that has been made for such case?
 
Your help will be highly appreciated

Dear colleagues,
 
I am looking for typical occupancy profiles for classrooms in North America.
On the web I found some cumulative numbers for classrooms in elementary

Varkie,

Figure 11.4.3 and Table 11.4.3.a in ASHRAE Standard 90.1 
Section 11 together show that the heating energy source for 
the proposed design and the energy cost budget building 
should be the same type: electric resistance is compared 
against electric resistance, heat pumps against heat pumps, 
and fossil fuel is compared against fossil fuel.  This 
approach in the Standard is intended to be "fuel neutral" 
and not penalize any fuel selection during the building 
design.  

A proposed design using multizone commercial building using 
a cooling system with a cooling tower maps to an energy 
cost budget using Figure 11.4.3 as System 1, VAV with 
parallel fan powered boxes with electric resistance.

As far as the use of Section 11 in LEED, I know that they 
have other provisions so you should review those carefully, 
my comments are related to Standard 90.1 only.

Trying to answer some of your other questions. ECB's 
purpose is a fair treatment of designs that don't meet all 
of the prescriptive sections of the standard but exceed 
requirements in other sections. It is not demand oriented 
at all but energy cost oriented.  ECB uses actual utility 
tariffs that are approved by the adopting authority. In the 
case of LEED, that would be USGBC.  TOU may or may not be 
acceptable, ask USGBC. Fluctuations in rates are a reality 
but I would suggest the rates that would be submitted are 
in affect when the application is submitted. No LCCA 
analysis is need since ECB is just looking at matching 
annual energy costs for a single year. 

I would be very suspicious of 60% savings over 90.1 unless 
some very significant investment is made in energy 
efficiency in the building.  I may be possible without 
PV/renewables but it would be difficult.

Hope this helps

Jason

Varkie:

The foreward of the 16 page Addendum E for Std 90.1-2001
(http://www.ashrae.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/30208)
addresses many of your questions. I would expect LEED 2.2 to reference
this "Informative Appendix G" performance Rating Method when describing
how to use simulation to determine a building's performance rating and
thus capture a number of Energy and Atmosphere points.  

In terms of LCCA, I was at a recent presentation on Std 90 by the
former chair of the committee. My understanding from this presentation
is that results from custom written software (NOT DOE2 or BLAST, I
asked) are used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of proposed changes
to 90.1. A fixed rate for fuel prices and electrical rates was used (for
the entire nation) and the effect on energy consumption of our nations
building stock (dominantly retail and small commercial) was estimated.
As far as differences in "wire to wire" efficiencies between nuclear,
gas, oil, coal, etc) are concerned, despite intense pressure from
industry, Std. 90 does not account for energy consumption using source
efficiency in any appreciable way. 

I'll send you his presentation if you would like (it's 30+ mb, too
large to e-mail).

Thanks,

When comparing standard design based on ASHRAE ST90 and a proposed
design for LEED points under "Optimize Energy Performance" using the
ECB
method, can the fuel types in both cases be made the same?  Does STD90
ECB method require natural gas equipment to be used for the standard
design if it produces lower energy costs?  
 
For example, three years ago, gas prices were at a record high and
electricity was relatively cheaper.  So a building was designed based
on
all electric equipment.  The proposed design saved about 30% in energy
usage per year and about the same in cost over the standard design
(electric or gas).  
 
Gas prices have since dropped significantly. The proposed design still
saves about 30% in energy compared to standard design.  The energy
cost
of the proposed all-electric design is now higher if it is compared to
the standard design based on current natural gas rates.  Can the
proposed electric design be compared to the standard model that also
uses all-electric equipment for LEED points? 
 
On page 63, Table 11.4.3A, Budget System Descriptions of ASHRAE
Std90-2001, System-1 is VAV with parallel fan-powered boxes and
electric
resistance heating (electric) and System-2 is VAV standard boxes with
hot water heating using fossil fuel boiler (gas).  If the proposed
design used System-1 (electric) then can the standard be System-1
although System-2 will use less energy and also cost less?
 
In comparing energy costs, does LEED consider the difference in source
energy efficiency between gas and electric?  What about long-term
reliability?  Electricity can be generated using a variety of fuels
including nuclear, whereas natural gas resources are limited and the
costs will therefore increase in the future with diminishing supplies. 

 
Is the purpose of the Energy "Cost" Budget method to reduce the energy
demand based on TOU rates?  Is the comparison between standard and
design for LEED points based on conditions at the time of design or at
the time of occupancy? Does ECB consider future fluctuating gas and

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Energy Cost Budget (ECB) Method & LEED
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200405171231.AA3152343pd80000159186@gard.com>

When comparing standard design based on ASHRAE ST90 and a proposed
design for LEED points under "Optimize Energy Performance" using the ECB
method, can the fuel types in both cases be made the same?  Does STD90
ECB method require natural gas equipment to be used for the standard
design if it produces lower energy costs?  
 
For example, three years ago, gas prices were at a record high and
electricity was relatively cheaper.  So a building was designed based on
all electric equipment.  The proposed design saved about 30% in energy
usage per year and about the same in cost over the standard design
(electric or gas).  
 
Gas prices have since dropped significantly. The proposed design still
saves about 30% in energy compared to standard design.  The energy cost
of the proposed all-electric design is now higher if it is compared to
the standard design based on current natural gas rates.  Can the
proposed electric design be compared to the standard model that also
uses all-electric equipment for LEED points? 
 
On page 63, Table 11.4.3A, Budget System Descriptions of ASHRAE
Std90-2001, System-1 is VAV with parallel fan-powered boxes and electric
resistance heating (electric) and System-2 is VAV standard boxes with
hot water heating using fossil fuel boiler (gas).  If the proposed
design used System-1 (electric) then can the standard be System-1
although System-2 will use less energy and also cost less?
 
In comparing energy costs, does LEED consider the difference in source
energy efficiency between gas and electric?  What about long-term
reliability?  Electricity can be generated using a variety of fuels
including nuclear, whereas natural gas resources are limited and the
costs will therefore increase in the future with diminishing supplies.  
 
Is the purpose of the Energy "Cost" Budget method to reduce the energy
demand based on TOU rates?  Is the comparison between standard and
design for LEED points based on conditions at the time of design or at
the time of occupancy? Does ECB consider future fluctuating gas and
electric rates?  Shouldn't there be a LCCA comparison of energy costs of
standard and proposed design using the DOE/FEMP future escalation rates?
 
Is it realistically possible to save over 60% in energy costs over STD90
design without using renewable energy such as PV-panels and GSHP?

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200405170408.AA0805734pd80000158317@gard.com>

Last week I submitted the message below, unfortunately my PC, including 
all your kind answers was stolen during this week-end.

So please, could those of you who kindly answered my request, send them
again.

Thank you in advance!

I am conducting a survey on passive cooling strategies, e.g. night cooling
of the building mass in order to reduce overheating the following day.

In this context I would like to know if anyone have knowledge of
surveys in the field of natural/night cooling where prediction of
the weather conditions for the coming day have been used to control the
flow of cool night air into the building?

Thank you in advance!

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200405121610.AA1013828pd80000149617@gard.com>

Dear colleagues,

The National Research Council Canada and Natural Resources Canada have
released a new version of our online RADIANCE-based daylighting analysis
tool Lightswitch Wizard  <http://www.buildwiz.com/> www.buildwiz.com. The
tool was developed to support daylighting-related design decisions in
commercial buildings during an early design stage. It offers a comparative,
reliable, and fast analysis of the amount of daylight available in
peripheral offices and classroom as well as the lighting energy performance
of automated lighting controls (occupancy sensors, photocells) compared to
standard on/off switches. Blinds are either manually or automatically
controlled. 
 
Features of the new version are:

*	

	added classrooms as a second building type
*	

	added 175 new sites outside of Canada and the US in the Northern
hemisphere
*	

	added a "Getting Started" section with two example applications to
give users ideas of how to use the tool 

Your comments/suggestions are appreciated. Greetings from Ottawa,

We have just completed the final report of a multi-year California Energy 
Commission PIER funded project known as "Alternatives to Compressor 
Cooling", the goal of which is to reduce or replace residential air 
conditioning through the use of nighttime ventilation. The NightBreeze 
system we developed under the project uses predictions of the next day's 
weather to calculate a ventilation temperature goal and to set ventilation 
fan speeds.

The final report and other information on the project can be found at:
http://www.energy.ca.gov/pier/reports/500-04-009.html
Information on the NightBreeze can be found at:
http://www.davisenergy.com/nb_page.htm

I would be very interested in the results of your survey. Please feel free 
to contact me if you need further information.

The controller is meant for residential fan-assisted night cooling, but 
I believe it incorporates some kind of self-predictive algorithms to 
control the rate. For use of weather service-issued forecasts, I'm not 
aware of anything, though it is likely some larger facilities in 
high-cooling cost areas may do this manually.

My PhD thesis (2001) addressed the topic of optimal predictive control 
in passive solar buildings. While the main emphasis was on controlling 
the heating plant in order to prevent afternoon overheating in 
mid-season conditions, the developed controller is suitable to control a 
mechanical or natural ventilation system in order to benefit from 
"optimal" night cooling. It uses (or generates) weather forecasts for 
the next 12 to 36 h. The thesis includes a literature review.

The format of the IWEC weather files is identical to that of TMY2, with two
minor differences - (1) the year is in four digits instead of two, and (2)
there is an extra field for visibility (?). What I did was to use an awk
script or shell editor to modify IWEC to TMY2 format, and then packed the
file with the DOE-2 weather packer (doewth) as TMY2 files.  I then wrote a
batch file that processed all 200 some IWEC files at one shot. Very
painless.  Having said that, I'd add a warning that the *.bin files loses
some precision, because the original IWEC have temperatures in tenths of
degrees C, while the *.bin files store them in integer degrees F.

The subject of my last message should have been "Moscow Weather" and not
"Radiant Heating/Cooling".  I did receive the Moscow weather in binary
format and the other information that I requested.  I think a program
that converts IWEC weather files into a "*.bin" files for use by the
DOE2 programs would be very useful.

Does anyone have the weather file (.bin format) for Moscow, Russia for

the raw TRY weather data from NCDC (.dat + .inp ?) into a .bin weather

I am trying to model a standard packaged Air Conditioner for my residence.  I am interested in the typical air conditions right after it exits the cooling coil.  I am mainly interested in how reduced the temperature should be below my set point temperature (I have seen roughly 15-25 F below), my air flow rate per ton of cooling (I have seen roughly 350-450 cfm/ton), and what the humidity ratio should be (right now I have set it at 0.0094).  Also, what is a typical Sensible Heating Ratio for a residential air conditioner (right now I'm geting ~75%) and if anyone could give me their estimation for the ton of cooling for a 2275 ft2 house in Atlanta would be that would be great.  Finally, other then ASHRAE Fundamentals, are there any other standard ratings for the exiting air conditions and where could I find them.

Thanks

Hi,
Is there any way I can assign an operation schedule for
exhaust fans in eQUEST? I am trying to model this facility
whos only heating source is a radiant slab, and the only
ventilation source is a series of exhaust fans.

Thanks

Samuel:

Both Mixing and CrossMixing in EnergyPlus have the feature you  
describe.  Both objects have a "delta temperature" field that sets the  
temperature difference for mixing. Look in the Input/Output Reference,   
Group Air Flow, Objects:  Mixing and Cross Mixing.

I am trying to simulate a Double Skin Building in Energy Plus and I have the fllowing dilema:

One can choose between Simple AIRFLOW and COMIS.

COMIS has the disadvantage that you have to simulate the whole building and will not accept non-communicating air paths - and besides cannot be used if you have a system simultaneously.

My best solution would have been if I could use with MIXING a MIXING RATE which depends on the temperature difference and can be stopped if the temperature difference is less than, say, two degrees. This is something that can be done with VENTILLATION but not with MIXING. Does any one know a way around this difficulty ?
