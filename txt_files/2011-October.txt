The building that I am working on will have upgrades to lighting and HVAC.
Running the proposed with both these systems as upgrades gives me ~40% cost
savings. This is more than the 40% that is needed (for lighting and HVAC
individually 20%). My question is if this is partially qualifying (less than
50%), then should I run lighting and HVAC separately? and each should be 20%
saving? In this case the benefit of lower lighting will not be available to
HVAC.

Thanks

Hi Rohini,

 

I haven't actually put together a final set of documentation for the modeling approaches, but having scoured the legislation & IRS clarification docs at one, here's my current understanding:

1.       "Running the proposed with both these systems as upgrades gives me ~40% cost savings."  ? This means the whole building approach is out (<50%).  You have to model the lighting/HVAC/envelope improvements independently ("partially qualifying").

2.       For each independently modeled component (lighting/HVAC/envelope) that pushes savings past the 16-2/3% improvement mark, you get to claim $0.60/SF for the deduction.  

3.       The improved HVAC run will not benefit from any lighting/envelope improvements for these partially qualifying runs, and so on.  

 

Not sure I recall a 20% improvement figure as part of the requirements, but I haven't brushed up on the particulars in a good while.

 

~Nick

Rohini,

We specialize in EPACT studies.  The IRS legislation is very complicated and vague.  However, to answer your questions:

1) Nick is correct.  If you cannot get to 50% with your model by combining all the improvements (HVAC, lighting, and envelope), then you must model them separately.  Remember, your baseline is not the building prior to the improvements.  Your baseline is an ASHRAE 90.1-2001 baseline.
2) You are looking for 20% improvement on building improvements placed into service in 2008 or later.  The 16 2/3% benchmark is only for years 2006 and 2007.
3) Nick is again correct.

We would be happy to work with you on future EPACT studies.  Best of luck.

Message-ID: <81CD81BB0AC1FF41B8F014BA7512A7400BF23F31@00mail.ad.fhai.org>

I am modeling a school that is 150,700 SF. There is a welding lab in the
school and it falls within the exceptions of ASHRAE 90.1 2007: G3.1.1
Exception b. ("Peak thermal loads that differ by 10 btuh/sf or more from
the average of the other spaces served by the system..."). The welding
lab is 3,500 SF and I would use System 3 (PSZ-AC) for this space.

 

When I refer to Table G3.1.1A, one of the notes reads "Where attributes
make a building eligible for more than one baseline system type, use the
predominant condition to determine the system type for the entire
building." Does this allow me to use System 5 (Packaged VAV with Reheat)
instead of System 7 (VAV with Reheat) since the predominant condition
serves 147,200 SF (150,700-3,500)? 

 

This is a LEED project and I would obviously rather use system 5 than
system 7 as my baseline HVAC system.

 

Thanks,

 

Otto

Hi Otto,

As per 90.1-2007 Addendum W, " Where attributes make a building eligible for
more than one *baseline *system type, use the predominant condition to
determine the system type for the entire building except as noted in
Exception a to Section G3.1.1." Since your lab < 20,000ft2, my understanding
is that you can use system 5.

My interpretation is that you determine your baseline system first
"based on usage, number of floors, conditioned floor area and heating
source", unless G3.1.1 exception a. applies. If, for example, your
school has 20,500 ft2 of classrooms with electric heating and the rest
of the school is gas, you could justify using both System 5 and System
6, instead of applying System 7 to the whole school. The note to Table
G3.1.1A only mentions exception a., so I don't think you can subtract
areas from other exceptions to G3.1.1 from the baseline system type
determination. If you're hoping to use System 5, carefully double-check
the conditioned floor area.

 

Regards,

Bill

Hi Otto, 

 

As per 90.1-2007 Addendum W, " Where attributes make a building eligible
for more than one baseline system type, use the predominant condition to
determine the system type for the entire building except as noted in
Exception a to Section G3.1.1." Since your lab < 20,000ft2, my
understanding is that you can use system 5.

Cheney

When I refer to Table G3.1.1A, one of the notes reads "Where attributes

serves 147,200 SF (150,700-3,500)? 

 

This is a LEED project and I would obviously rather use system 5 than
system 7 as my baseline HVAC system.

 

Thanks,

Thanks Bill,

 

I think you are right. I will have to use exception "a" from G3.1.1 in
order to use system 5. The academic portion of the building has a VRF
system with the outside air conditioned by hot water from a natural gas
condensing boiler. I am going to separate the spaces that have outside
air (classrooms, offices, corridors......) and spaces that has no direct
outside air (restrooms, technology rooms.....) in the model so I can use
system 5 and 6 if the areas that are conditioned with only electric is
over 20,000 SF. This should work because the spaces that have outside
are conditioned with natural gas/electric and many of the other areas
are conditioned with only electric.

Hi Josh!

 

I took this as a sign that I need to freshen up on the recent legislation/clarifications... I found the 20% reference, but I'm finding something a bit more nuanced than a blanket 20%:

 

Ref: IRS Notice 2008-40 (http://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-14_IRB/ar12.html), Section 7:

 

.01 Energy Savings Percentages. A taxpayer may apply section 2.05 of Notice 2006-52 by substituting "10" for "162/3" in section 2.05(1) of such notice. If a taxpayer makes this substitution, the taxpayer must apply sections 2.03 and 2.04 of Notice 2006-52 by substituting "20" for "162/3" in sections 2.03(1)(a) and 2.04(1) of such notice. If ? 179D is extended beyond December 31, 2008 [insert: it was, until December 31, 2013, by the same legislation introducing the TARP], the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department expect, in the absence of other changes to ? 179D, that the substitute percentages set forth in this section will be the only percentages used in determining whether property placed in service after December 31, 2008, is partially qualifying property.

 

Having gone back and revised my copy of 2006-52 per the above, my interpretation is that improvements put into service after 2008 need to demonstrate a 20% improvement for lighting and/or HVAC, but only 10% for envelopes.

 

Partially qualifying installations put into service after December 31, 2008 have to submit for deductions using the 20/20/10 benchmarks.  Anything prior has the option of submitting under either set.

 

That said, is there more recent legislation or an IRS "clarification" (haha) that mandates 20% for envelopes as well?

Rohini,

 

We specialize in EPACT studies.  The IRS legislation is very complicated and vague.  However, to answer your questions:

 

1) Nick is correct.  If you cannot get to 50% with your model by combining all the improvements (HVAC, lighting, and envelope), then you must model them separately.  Remember, your baseline is not the building prior to the improvements.  Your baseline is an ASHRAE 90.1-2001 baseline.

2) You are looking for 20% improvement on building improvements placed into service in 2008 or later.  The 16 2/3% benchmark is only for years 2006 and 2007.

3) Nick is again correct.

 

We would be happy to work with you on future EPACT studies.  Best of luck.

Hi Rohini,

 

I haven't actually put together a final set of documentation for the modeling approaches, but having scoured the legislation & IRS clarification docs at one, here's my current understanding:

1.      "Running the proposed with both these systems as upgrades gives me ~40% cost savings."  ? This means the whole building approach is out (<50%).  You have to model the lighting/HVAC/envelope improvements independently ("partially qualifying").

2.      For each independently modeled component (lighting/HVAC/envelope) that pushes savings past the 16-2/3% improvement mark, you get to claim $0.60/SF for the deduction.  

3.      The improved HVAC run will not benefit from any lighting/envelope improvements for these partially qualifying runs, and so on.  

 

Not sure I recall a 20% improvement figure as part of the requirements, but I haven't brushed up on the particulars in a good while.

The building that I am working on will have upgrades to lighting and HVAC. Running the proposed with both these systems as upgrades gives me ~40% cost savings. This is more than the 40% that is needed (for lighting and HVAC individually 20%). My question is if this is partially qualifying (less than 50%), then should I run lighting and HVAC separately? and each should be 20% saving? In this case the benefit of lower lighting will not be available to HVAC.

 

Thanks

I would just add that the 10% makes a lot more sense than the previous benchmark.  We haven't had a project that came that close to 16-2/3% savings on the envelope, even with very high performance construction.  I suppose the more extreme the climate the better chance you have of hitting that benchmark...but it seems like the threshold wasn't fully thought out when the regulations were first written.

Hi Rohini,

 

I haven't actually put together a final set of documentation for the modeling approaches, but having scoured the legislation & IRS clarification docs at one, here's my current understanding:

1.      "Running the proposed with both these systems as upgrades gives me ~40% cost savings."  ? This means the whole building approach is out (<50%).  You have to model the lighting/HVAC/envelope improvements independently ("partially qualifying").

2.      For each independently modeled component (lighting/HVAC/envelope) that pushes savings past the 16-2/3% improvement mark, you get to claim $0.60/SF for the deduction.  

3.      The improved HVAC run will not benefit from any lighting/envelope improvements for these partially qualifying runs, and so on.  

 

Not sure I recall a 20% improvement figure as part of the requirements, but I haven't brushed up on the particulars in a good while.

The building that I am working on will have upgrades to lighting and HVAC. Running the proposed with both these systems as upgrades gives me ~40% cost savings. This is more than the 40% that is needed (for lighting and HVAC individually 20%). My question is if this is partially qualifying (less than 50%), then should I run lighting and HVAC separately? and each should be 20% saving? In this case the benefit of lower lighting will not be available to HVAC.

 

Thanks

Nick,

You are correct!  Prior to 2008, the energy savings targets are 16 2/3% across the board for envelope, HVAC, or lighting modeled individually.  IRS 2008-40 mandated the target to be 20/20/10 (lighting/HVAC/envelope) for all buildings placed into service in 2008 or later.  It also gave the option to use 20/20/10 or 16 2/3% for 2006 and 2007 so long as you don't mix and match.  For instance, you can't use 10% for the envelope and then use 16 2/3% for the HVAC for a building placed into service is 2006 or 2007.

There are no other hidden changes other than these.  Envelope is either 10% or 16 2/3% depending on the year placed in service and the standard that you choose to use.

Wow, I can't believe you would suggest that environmentalist would pass laws
and regulations without fully thinking out all the issues and ramifications.
Are you suggesting it was a knee jerk reaction? I'm sure there was a
consensus when they passed the regulation and you can't get more scientific
than that.

Now go put a mercury light bulb in your children's room, take a nice shower
with a low flow head, flush the low flow toilet 3 times to get it to work, go
for a ride in a fuel efficient rolling coffin and prepare for global warming.

Your big brother will take care of everything.

I would just add that the 10% makes a lot more sense than the previous
benchmark.  We haven't had a project that came that close to 16-2/3% savings
on the envelope, even with very high performance construction.  I suppose the
more extreme the climate the better chance you have of hitting that
benchmark...but it seems like the threshold wasn't fully thought out when the
regulations were first written.

Hi Josh!

 

I took this as a sign that I need to freshen up on the recent
legislation/clarifications... I found the 20% reference, but I'm finding
something a bit more nuanced than a blanket 20%:

 

Ref: IRS Notice 2008-40 (http://www.irs.gov/irb/2008-14_IRB/ar12.html),
Section 7:

 

.01 Energy Savings Percentages. A taxpayer may apply section 2.05 of Notice
2006-52 by substituting "10" for "162/3" in section 2.05(1) of such notice.
If a taxpayer makes this substitution, the taxpayer must apply sections 2.03
and 2.04 of Notice 2006-52 by substituting "20" for "162/3" in sections
2.03(1)(a) and 2.04(1) of such notice. If ? 179D is extended beyond December
31, 2008 [insert: it was, until December 31, 2013, by the same legislation
introducing the TARP], the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury
Department expect, in the absence of other changes to ? 179D, that the
substitute percentages set forth in this section will be the only percentages
used in determining whether property placed in service after December 31,
2008, is partially qualifying property.

 

Having gone back and revised my copy of 2006-52 per the above, my
interpretation is that improvements put into service after 2008 need to
demonstrate a 20% improvement for lighting and/or HVAC, but only 10% for
envelopes.

 

Partially qualifying installations put into service after December 31, 2008
have to submit for deductions using the 20/20/10 benchmarks.  Anything prior
has the option of submitting under either set.

 

That said, is there more recent legislation or an IRS "clarification" (haha)
that mandates 20% for envelopes as well?

Rohini,

 

We specialize in EPACT studies.  The IRS legislation is very complicated and
vague.  However, to answer your questions:

 

1) Nick is correct.  If you cannot get to 50% with your model by combining
all the improvements (HVAC, lighting, and envelope), then you must model them
separately.  Remember, your baseline is not the building prior to the
improvements.  Your baseline is an ASHRAE 90.1-2001 baseline.

2) You are looking for 20% improvement on building improvements placed into
service in 2008 or later.  The 16 2/3% benchmark is only for years 2006 and
2007.

3) Nick is again correct.

 

We would be happy to work with you on future EPACT studies.  Best of luck.

Message-ID: <3D39560EBFFAE546B42020BD8068801F7281D83556@extprdmbx01.bentley.com>

Bentley Systems released v1.0 of its new building performance simulation product, AECOsim Energy Simulator, on September 30th.  Energy Simulator is available now through the Bentley web site (www.bentley.com<http://www.bentley.com>) including a 30-day trial.  General information on Energy Simulator is available here:   www.bentley.com/en-US/Promo/AECOsim/aecosim+energy+simulator.htm<http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Promo/AECOsim/aecosim+energy+simulator.htm>

Energy Simulator incorporates the EnergyPlus V6.0  simulation engine for building performance calculations but also include steady state design methods including ASHRAE RTS and CIBSE Heat Gain/Heat Loss.  Built on top of Bentley's BIM platform, Energy Simulator allows users to work seamlessly between industry CAD, BIM, and AEC applications such as MicroStation, AutoCAD, Revit, and others and supports standard file formats such as gbXML, DXF, DGN, and DWG.

Energy Simulator features comprehensive HVAC systems capabilities - exposing all the inputs for EnergyPlus HVAC components and systems but also provides more than 17 preconfigured HVAC systems that require few users inputs. The HVAC designer also displays the loops and connections for the systems.  Energy Simulator automatically creates the baseline and budget buildings for ASHRAE Standard 90.1 (2004 and 2007) and creates energy performance data for use in AECOsim Compliance Manager for LEED 3.0 documentation.

Check out the video demos of Energy Simulator here:  www.bentley.com/en-us/promo/greenbuild/<http://www.bentley.com/en-us/promo/greenbuild/>

Bentley will be demonstrating Energy Simulator at GreenBuild in Toronto this week.

Please note that December 1st, 2011 is the deadline for all abstracts.     The conference organizers are limiting the number of peer-reviewed oral presentations in order to maintain a high level of quality in the papers. Submissions will therefore be rigorously peer-reviewed. Paper submissions should deal with computer-based building performance simulation (BPS) with the scope ranging from individual building components to whole buildings and neighborhoods. Basic phenomena of interest include the modeling of heat and mass transfer, air movement, natural and electric light as well as controls and occupant behavior. Other suitable topics include new developments in tools for modeling and simulation, automated optimization during des
 ign and operations, stochastic modeling and data visualization, the generation of climate datasets and successful applications of BPS in design practice (case studies), incentive programs, building operations and education.      In addition to the technical papers, a limited number of non-peer-reviewed oral presentations will be sought in order to enable practitioners and researchers to address simulation-related issues such as: the future of BEM software; modeling controls in BEM software; use of simulation in real-time to support building operation; dealing with uncertainty in building performance simulation; validation, calibration and verification of simulation using real time data; model predictive control in buildings; use of BEM in a building system fault finding capacity; appropriate modeling for the different phases of a building design; and case studies of the application of modeling in building design.  The meeting is open to all, world-wide. Madison is located in
  the middle of the US near to Chicago and Minneapolis. The conference will be held at The Madison Concourse Hotel in downtown Madison.    Submission of Abstracts:    Abstracts are due by December 1st, 2011 and should be a maximum of 200 words. Abstracts should be submitted through the SimBuild 2012 website.

So far I have not been successful in obtaining the correct results for
PSI value calculation validation examples (EN ISO 10211:2007) using
THERM 6.3, although I have managed to calculate temperatures fairly
accurately.

 

Is anyone able to help with a THERM query or alternatively could someone
suggest a better software package for PSI calcs?

Sir -

I recently came across some briefings on PSI analysis using THERM for the North American market re: PassivHaus. The best I saw were from David White at Right Environments.

Not sure if this is relevant (generic v. specific, N Amer v Europe, PH analysis v. others), but perhaps you'll find the below procedures helpful?

I think something is missing in the story here...

 

A reduction of lighting consumption is claimed to reduce heating
consumption?

 

As you say, lights are an internal heat source to some extent...
reducing the lighting energy consumed by a significant fraction should
cause a relative increase in heating and a reduction of cooling
energies, right?  I'm going to assume the reviewer's vocabulary is
simply flipped around and this is the point they were trying to make:
Changing lighting should affect heating/cooling consumptions.

 

As to how you document this - It would seem simplest if you simply
worked your "exceptionally calculated" reduction back into the model.
>From your description I don't know exactly what your "hard-wiring"
strategy is that's chopping off 40%, but applying a factor to the space
LPD's may be a decent approach.  You could then demonstrate before/after
results showing lighting/heating/cooling consumptions moving about by
setting up  a parametric run and using those reports.

Well, my understanding is that exceptional calculation is used to document
meansres that may not be adequately modelled in a simulaiton program. Some
examples are lab exhaust system, appliance efficiencies in high-rise
residential building, etc. How do you define your hard-wired lighting
calculation from this point of view?

Remodeling with reduded LPD is necessary provided your hard-wired lighting
reduction affects internal heat gain and you would expect more heating
energy in this manner. I guess it is what the reviewer expect to see unless
you can  prove him/her that your reduction will not trigger heating/cooling
energy variation.

Good point Cheney!

 

I suppose I have a more general understanding that "exceptional
calculations" exist for when you have designed energy saving measures
which cannot be credited following 90.1/LEED "to the letter."

 

To use your example of improved appliance efficiencies, my intuition
would be to produce extra documentation/calculations to substantiate a
certain % reduction in installed plug loads, then I'd apply that
reduction to the proposed model.  These calculations and a brief
description of how they were compiled and applied to the proposed model
would be uploaded and referenced alongside the modeling templates.
Perhaps my terminology is off and this is not really an "exceptional
calculation?"

 

But to clarify for the topic at hand, I suppose my response might best
include another query: what is this hard-wiring strategy and why isn't
it already in the model?  It's possible an LPD reduction would not
adequately reflect whatever is really going on.

Hi Nick,

I can not agree with you more. Ashraf will have to answer why such 40%
reduction is not reflected in the original energy modeling.

The only divergence is the example with which you believe the appliances
fall into "plug loads" whereas I believe they could be "process one". Again,
it really depends on which LEED system (2009 or older version) we are using.
No process loads will be included in modeling under the old LEED system. In
another words, no penalty for heating due to reduced process load. However,
your methodology is accurate under the new LEED since both plug load and
process load should be involved in energy modeling.

Regards,

Cheney

Exceptional calculations performed for Residential building, LEED NC V2.2.
Interior lighting calculations performed based on the CIR dated on
3/23/2007.

 

As CIR states that all hard-wired lighting in living units that is shown on
the building plans should be modeled identically in the Baseline and
Proposed building simulations as shown in the plans. This lighting shall be
considered process energy. Also it states that credit can be taken for an
efficient lighting design in the living unit using the Exceptional
Calculations Methodology. It suggests the figures schedule near 2 hours a
day or less for hard-wired residential fixtures. 

 

For an example in Bedroom baseline calculated as 2 W/sqft with occupancy of
2 hours a day and for propose case 1 W/sqft with same 2 hours a days. A
similar calculation has performed for entire building and I achieved 40%
savings in wattages.

 

Then reduction of wattage we are showing in Section 1.7 - Exceptional
Calculation Measure Summary. So leed reviewer is requesting to provide
heating impact on cooling and shown the calculations with zone wise and to
incorporate in energy model and Template.

Ashraf

Good point Cheney!

 

I suppose I have a more general understanding that "exceptional
calculations" exist for when you have designed energy saving measures which
cannot be credited following 90.1/LEED "to the letter."

 

To use your example of improved appliance efficiencies, my intuition would
be to produce extra documentation/calculations to substantiate a certain %
reduction in installed plug loads, then I'd apply that reduction to the
proposed model.  These calculations and a brief description of how they were
compiled and applied to the proposed model would be uploaded and referenced
alongside the modeling templates.  Perhaps my terminology is off and this is
not really an "exceptional calculation?"

 

But to clarify for the topic at hand, I suppose my response might best
include another query: what is this hard-wiring strategy and why isn't it
already in the model?  It's possible an LPD reduction would not adequately
reflect whatever is really going on.

Well, my understanding is that exceptional calculation is used to document
meansres that may not be adequately modelled in a simulaiton program. Some
examples are lab exhaust system, appliance efficiencies in high-rise
residential building, etc. How do you define your hard-wired lighting
calculation from this point of view? 

 

Remodeling with reduded LPD is necessary provided your hard-wired lighting
reduction affects internal heat gain and you would expect more heating
energy in this manner. I guess it is what the reviewer expect to see unless
you can  prove him/her that your reduction will not trigger heating/cooling
energy variation.

As you say, lights are an internal heat source to some extent. reducing the
lighting energy consumed by a significant fraction should cause a relative
increase in heating and a reduction of cooling energies, right?  I'm going
to assume the reviewer's vocabulary is simply flipped around and this is the

As to how you document this - It would seem simplest if you simply worked
your "exceptionally calculated" reduction back into the model.   From your
description I don't know exactly what your "hard-wiring" strategy is that's
chopping off 40%, but applying a factor to the space LPD's may be a decent

lighting/heating/cooling consumptions moving about by setting up  a

I have performed Exceptional calculations in EAC1 credit for internal
hard-wired lighting. I achieved savings up to 40%. 

 

In Preliminary review, I received below comment 

 

"It is does not appear as if the reduction in heating consumption was
considered. Address the reduction in space heating and ensure the
consumption is appropriately reduced, and provide a revised template and
updated energy model output summaries reflecting the changes."

 

 

As light generates heating, so leed reviewer is requesting to provide the
heating consumption calculations and to achieve more savings as it directly

Could you please guide how to perform these heating consumption calculations
and how to incorporate in energy model and Template with reference?

Hello all,

For EQc7.1 in LEED NC 2009, I need to provide detailed calculations for
"operative temperature".
ASHRAE 55 appendix C gives you the formula to calculate operative
temperature, but that requires mean radiant temperature. And the formula for
"mean radiant temperature" requires globe temperature.
I am trying to find a graph/chart/table from which I can obtain the "globe
temperature" or do I even need to find globe temperature ?
Any insights, suggestions would be appreciated.

I never knew that the MRT calculation would require Globe Temp.  My
understanding of this is that the Globe Temperature is actually a function
of Air Temp, MRT and the convection (air speed effects.)  The MRT is
calculable from the temperature of the surrounding surfaces.  If the Op Temp
calculation includes air temp, MRT, RH, and air speed, then there is no need
to ever know Globe Temp.   Opinions here, maybe not facts!

Yes, MRT needs Globe Temperature.
Globe temperature requires a Globe Thermometer.  Radio Shack used to carry them.
There are no tables that could give you a Globe Temperature, because the reading depends on the specific space you're studying.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Comfort calculation (globe temperature)

Hello all,

For EQc7.1 in LEED NC 2009, I need to provide detailed calculations for "operative temperature".
ASHRAE 55 appendix C gives you the formula to calculate operative temperature, but that requires mean radiant temperature. And the formula for "mean radiant temperature" requires globe temperature.
I am trying to find a graph/chart/table from which I can obtain the "globe temperature" or do I even need to find globe temperature ?
Any insights, suggestions would be appreciated.

Right,
Because if you see the formula for MRT, as the air velocity approaches to
zero, MRT gets closer to globe temperature.
So MRT is equal to globe temperature, but only with zero air movement.

I am still not able to figure out a way to document the MRT calculations as
there is no way I would be able to measure the actual globe temperature.
How am I suppose to show the PMV/PPD calculations and operative temperature
calculations in LEED documentations ?

Ashraf -

I believe it is acceptable for your "exceptional calculation" to actually be an additional energy model case.

I agree that you are taking the right approach with respect to the CIR mentioned.

Based on earlier correspondence I'm assuming you have provided adequate documentation assuring the reviewer that your selected lighting power reductions are justified.

Could you then incorporate these revised LPD numbers into an additional case of the proposed model, done to the side?

This would give you an "exceptional savings", incorporating lighting savings as well as potential cooling savings / heating increases...

Exceptional calculations performed for Residential building, LEED NC V2.2. Interior lighting calculations performed based on the CIR dated on 3/23/2007.

As CIR states that all hard-wired lighting in living units that is shown on the building plans should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed building simulations as shown in the plans. This lighting shall be considered process energy. Also it states that credit can be taken for an efficient lighting design in the living unit using the Exceptional Calculations Methodology. It suggests the figures schedule near 2 hours a day or less for hard-wired residential fixtures.


For an example in Bedroom baseline calculated as 2 W/sqft with occupancy of 2 hours a day and for propose case 1 W/sqft with same 2 hours a days. A similar calculation has performed for entire building and I achieved 40% savings in wattages.



Then reduction of wattage we are showing in Section 1.7 - Exceptional Calculation Measure Summary. So leed reviewer is requesting to provide heating impact on cooling and shown the calculations with zone wise and to incorporate in energy model and Template.

Ashraf

Hi Nick,

I can not agree with you more. Ashraf will have to answer why such 40% reduction is not reflected in the original energy modeling.

The only divergence is the example with which you believe the appliances fall into "plug loads" whereas I believe they could be "process one". Again, it really depends on which LEED system (2009 or older version) we are using. No process loads will be included in modeling under the old LEED system. In another words, no penalty for heating due to reduced process load. However, your methodology is accurate under the new LEED since both plug load and process load should be involved in energy modeling.

Cheney

Good point Cheney!

I suppose I have a more general understanding that "exceptional calculations" exist for when you have designed energy saving measures which cannot be credited following 90.1/LEED "to the letter."

To use your example of improved appliance efficiencies, my intuition would be to produce extra documentation/calculations to substantiate a certain % reduction in installed plug loads, then I'd apply that reduction to the proposed model.  These calculations and a brief description of how they were compiled and applied to the proposed model would be uploaded and referenced alongside the modeling templates.  Perhaps my terminology is off and this is not really an "exceptional calculation?"

But to clarify for the topic at hand, I suppose my response might best include another query: what is this hard-wiring strategy and why isn't it already in the model?  It's possible an LPD reduction would not adequately reflect whatever is really going on.

Well, my understanding is that exceptional calculation is used to document meansres that may not be adequately modelled in a simulaiton program. Some examples are lab exhaust system, appliance efficiencies in high-rise residential building, etc. How do you define your hard-wired lighting calculation from this point of view?

Remodeling with reduded LPD is necessary provided your hard-wired lighting reduction affects internal heat gain and you would expect more heating energy in this manner. I guess it is what the reviewer expect to see unless you can  prove him/her that your reduction will not trigger heating/cooling energy variation.

I think something is missing in the story here...

A reduction of lighting consumption is claimed to reduce heating consumption?

As you say, lights are an internal heat source to some extent... reducing the lighting energy consumed by a significant fraction should cause a relative increase in heating and a reduction of cooling energies, right?  I'm going to assume the reviewer's vocabulary is simply flipped around and this is the point they were trying to make:  Changing lighting should affect heating/cooling consumptions.

As to how you document this - It would seem simplest if you simply worked your "exceptionally calculated" reduction back into the model.   From your description I don't know exactly what your "hard-wiring" strategy is that's chopping off 40%, but applying a factor to the space LPD's may be a decent approach.  You could then demonstrate before/after results showing lighting/heating/cooling consumptions moving about by setting up  a parametric run and using those reports.

I have performed Exceptional calculations in EAC1 credit for internal hard-wired lighting. I achieved savings up to 40%.

In Preliminary review, I received below comment

"It is does not appear as if the reduction in heating consumption was considered. Address the reduction in space heating and ensure the consumption is appropriately reduced, and provide a revised template and updated energy model output summaries reflecting the changes."


As light generates heating, so leed reviewer is requesting to provide the heating consumption calculations and to achieve more savings as it directly impact on cooling, even though calculations performed exceptionally.

Could you please guide how to perform these heating consumption calculations and how to incorporate in energy model and Template with reference?

Are you able to claim that the operative temperature equals the air
temperature based on the 4 criteria listed in Appendix C?  All my LEED
projects have met those criteria and GBCI accepted it.  Don't know what to
tell you, though, if the criteria do not apply . sorry.

Globe temperature requires a Globe Thermometer.  Radio Shack used to carry

There are no tables that could give you a Globe Temperature, because the

I never knew that the MRT calculation would require Globe Temp.  My
understanding of this is that the Globe Temperature is actually a function
of Air Temp, MRT and the convection (air speed effects.)  The MRT is
calculable from the temperature of the surrounding surfaces.  If the Op Temp
calculation includes air temp, MRT, RH, and air speed, then there is no need
to ever know Globe Temp.   Opinions here, maybe not facts!

Whether the models already incorporate these loads in some fashion will
determine whether you need to add or subtract to illustrate the point.  

 

Aaron's suggestion should be fairly straightforward:

*         Save a copy of your proposed/baseline models as they are -
you'll reference them later.

*         Either add the loads under discussion to both models or make
them distinct from other lighting/miscellaneous loads as appropriate.  I
would intuitively use an additional line under space lighting inputs -
but keep in mind you're being told to report these as a process energy,
in LEED terms... I expect this is a matter of terminology for your
calculations.

*         Space equipment loads and lighting loads will by default
reject wattage as sensible heat to the space and/or plenum in some
fraction.  Modify if necessary.  Defining these as a lighting load would
make inputs simpler if you desire to reject a percentage to plenum.  

*         Since this tangent came up recently on another thread:  Note
that treating lighting input wattages as a 100% sensible heat load is
entirely appropriate for conventional lighting sources in a building.
Generally only a small fraction of input watts is converted into light
energy in our visible spectrum.  Some (not most) LED solutions, green
lasers and oddball stars in the sky are exceptions to the rule in strict
terms of luminous efficacy, but even then it's a moot point unless
you're largely directing your lights outside a window - it's all
ultimately a heat load in your space.

*         These loads should have unique scheduling assigned to match
your description/calculations

*         The baseline and proposed loads should differ in magnitude per
your description/calculations

*         When done, your models will reflect the savings targeted, and
these lights' effects on cooling/heating consumption.  The models figure
out the heating/cooling impact stuff in the course of an ordinary
simulation

*         When done, set up a few parametric runs in any one model: Use
that "based on another file" parametric run option, and simply reference
your proposed/baseline models (.inp) with and without the
added/re-defined loads.  A parametric run will result in reports that
show all consumptions for all 4 iterations side-by-side.  Should be a
perfect illustration to include with your response.

Ashraf - 

 

I believe it is acceptable for your "exceptional calculation" to
actually be an additional energy model case.

 

I agree that you are taking the right approach with respect to the CIR
mentioned.

 

Based on earlier correspondence I'm assuming you have provided adequate
documentation assuring the reviewer that your selected lighting power
reductions are justified.

 

Could you then incorporate these revised LPD numbers into an additional
case of the proposed model, done to the side?

 

This would give you an "exceptional savings", incorporating lighting
savings as well as potential cooling savings / heating increases...

Exceptional calculations performed for Residential building, LEED NC
V2.2. Interior lighting calculations performed based on the CIR dated on
3/23/2007.

 

As CIR states that all hard-wired lighting in living units that is shown
on the building plans should be modeled identically in the Baseline and
Proposed building simulations as shown in the plans. This lighting shall
be considered process energy. Also it states that credit can be taken
for an efficient lighting design in the living unit using the
Exceptional Calculations Methodology. It suggests the figures schedule
near 2 hours a day or less for hard-wired residential fixtures. 

 

For an example in Bedroom baseline calculated as 2 W/sqft with occupancy
of 2 hours a day and for propose case 1 W/sqft with same 2 hours a days.
A similar calculation has performed for entire building and I achieved
40% savings in wattages.

 

Then reduction of wattage we are showing in Section 1.7 - Exceptional
Calculation Measure Summary. So leed reviewer is requesting to provide
heating impact on cooling and shown the calculations with zone wise and
to incorporate in energy model and Template.

 

Regards,

Ashraf

Hi Nick, 

 

I can not agree with you more. Ashraf will have to answer why such 40%
reduction is not reflected in the original energy modeling. 

 

The only divergence is the example with which you believe the appliances
fall into "plug loads" whereas I believe they could be "process one".
Again, it really depends on which LEED system (2009 or older version) we
are using. No process loads will be included in modeling under the old
LEED system. In another words, no penalty for heating due to reduced
process load. However, your methodology is accurate under the new LEED
since both plug load and process load should be involved in energy
modeling.  

 

Regards, 

 

Cheney

Good point Cheney!

 

I suppose I have a more general understanding that "exceptional
calculations" exist for when you have designed energy saving measures
which cannot be credited following 90.1/LEED "to the letter."

 

To use your example of improved appliance efficiencies, my intuition
would be to produce extra documentation/calculations to substantiate a
certain % reduction in installed plug loads, then I'd apply that
reduction to the proposed model.  These calculations and a brief
description of how they were compiled and applied to the proposed model
would be uploaded and referenced alongside the modeling templates.
Perhaps my terminology is off and this is not really an "exceptional
calculation?"

 

But to clarify for the topic at hand, I suppose my response might best
include another query: what is this hard-wiring strategy and why isn't
it already in the model?  It's possible an LPD reduction would not
adequately reflect whatever is really going on.

Well, my understanding is that exceptional calculation is used to
document meansres that may not be adequately modelled in a simulaiton
program. Some examples are lab exhaust system, appliance efficiencies in
high-rise residential building, etc. How do you define your hard-wired
lighting calculation from this point of view? 

 

Remodeling with reduded LPD is necessary provided your hard-wired
lighting reduction affects internal heat gain and you would expect more
heating energy in this manner. I guess it is what the reviewer expect to
see unless you can  prove him/her that your reduction will not trigger
heating/cooling energy variation.

I think something is missing in the story here...

 

A reduction of lighting consumption is claimed to reduce heating

As you say, lights are an internal heat source to some extent...
reducing the lighting energy consumed by a significant fraction should
cause a relative increase in heating and a reduction of cooling
energies, right?  I'm going to assume the reviewer's vocabulary is
simply flipped around and this is the point they were trying to make:
Changing lighting should affect heating/cooling consumptions.

 

As to how you document this - It would seem simplest if you simply
worked your "exceptionally calculated" reduction back into the model.
>From your description I don't know exactly what your "hard-wiring"
strategy is that's chopping off 40%, but applying a factor to the space
LPD's may be a decent approach.  You could then demonstrate before/after
results showing lighting/heating/cooling consumptions moving about by
setting up  a parametric run and using those reports.

I have performed Exceptional calculations in EAC1 credit for internal
hard-wired lighting. I achieved savings up to 40%. 

 

In Preliminary review, I received below comment 

 

"It is does not appear as if the reduction in heating consumption was
considered. Address the reduction in space heating and ensure the
consumption is appropriately reduced, and provide a revised template and
updated energy model output summaries reflecting the changes."

 

 

As light generates heating, so leed reviewer is requesting to provide
the heating consumption calculations and to achieve more savings as it
directly impact on cooling, even though calculations performed
exceptionally.

 

Could you please guide how to perform these heating consumption
calculations and how to incorporate in energy model and Template with
reference?

 

Thanks,

Ashraf Khan

Message-ID: <1317933706.68332.YahooMailNeo@web160613.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hi folks,

I'm currently involved with a prospective project to retrofit an existing urban office building in a robust four-season climate. The building is roughly 60 floors, circa early 1960's, with an original single pane, non-thermally-broken aluminum curtain wall, and anodized aluminum spandrel panels. We don't have exact glazing specs yet, but COG is likely in the range of: SHGC=0.43, Tvis=0.53, Uval=1.00


Here's the question: If you wanted to retrofit the facade to improve overall building energy / occupant comfort (heating, cooling, solar control, daylighting, MRT adjacent to glazing, etc.),?but were required to retain the original glazing (for architectural considerations, or due to impracticality of complete facade removal with existing tenants), what options might you pursue? Additional potential constraints of note (still to be determined) may include: mullion depth limitations, structural facade load limits. Also worth noting that the building's rectangular plan features a SW-facing long-axis orientation, so spring-through-fall cooling loads are likely to be enormous. Finally, if a second skin solution is to be pursued, we're also keen to keep an eye on condensation issues.

What's the latest, greatest thinking in this arena??Suggestions / comments much appreciated....

cheers,

Adam

Varun,

MRT, strongly depends on envelope properties and most of time Globe
temperature is considered as MRT but it is not acceptable always.  MRT
is calculated by three different ways-
-by calculating surface angle view factor
-through globe temperature
-using Rayman Model

hope this is useful to you.

How about adding a removable lite of glass from the interior at vision
areas? Removable to allow cleaning in between lites should there be any
incidental scumming over time. Inner lite can be kept in place with a 2
piece stop and perimeter gaskets. The new inner glass lite can be coated
with a solar control pyrolytic low-e coating (Pilkington has one). Work
can be done at night to limit tenant disruption.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Curtain wall retrofit options

 

Hi folks,

 

I'm currently involved with a prospective project to retrofit an
existing urban office building in a robust four-season climate. The
building is roughly 60 floors, circa early 1960's, with an original
single pane, non-thermally-broken aluminum curtain wall, and anodized
aluminum spandrel panels. We don't have exact glazing specs yet, but COG
is likely in the range of: SHGC=0.43, Tvis=0.53, Uval=1.00

 

Here's the question: If you wanted to retrofit the facade to improve
overall building energy / occupant comfort (heating, cooling, solar
control, daylighting, MRT adjacent to glazing, etc.), but were required
to retain the original glazing (for architectural considerations, or due
to impracticality of complete facade removal with existing tenants),
what options might you pursue? Additional potential constraints of note
(still to be determined) may include: mullion depth limitations,
structural facade load limits. Also worth noting that the building's
rectangular plan features a SW-facing long-axis orientation, so
spring-through-fall cooling loads are likely to be enormous. Finally, if
a second skin solution is to be pursued, we're also keen to keep an eye
on condensation issues.

 

What's the latest, greatest thinking in this arena? Suggestions /
comments much appreciated....

 

cheers,

 

Adam

Thanks to everyone for all the good responses on and off-list. It's an interesting little puzzle given some of the constraints. I'm responding individually off-list.?

Hi there,

is there anyone who knows about a tool or validation data to simulate or
estimate the effect of the temperature and RH on a green roof and what the
impact is of the temperature at the bottom-site of the green roof system?

Thanks already!

Dear all,

I am looking for data on the temperature at the roof-site of the solar
PV-panels when mounted on a horizontal, tilted or vertical surface as a
function of the intensity of the solar radiation and the outdoor conditions
(wind and tempearture). This both for PV with a ventilated space below and
for those mounted directly on the roof-surface.
This in order to simulate the performance of an alternative thermal solar
system.

Thanks already for any input!

Leen,

As Sasa pointed out you can model green roofs in EnergyPlus, you will need info regarding LAI, stomatal resistance, etc. I would also recommend looking at this study where I looked into those variables you are mentioning as well as validating a green roof model.

A heat transfer model for assessment of plant based roofing systems in summer conditions

Experimental quantification of heat and mass transfer process through vegetated roof samples in a new laboratory setup

Let me know if you have any questions

Leen,

A study of roof temperatures on a building in Michigan can be found at http://www.sustainablefacility.com/articles/testing-at-the-top.

A Canadian study has some roof temperature data in http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/pubs/nrcc46412/nrcc46412.pdf .

The best information I have seen regarding simulating vegetated roofs is from a presentation from the ASHRAE Energy Modeling Conference last April. The presentation is attached.

Hello Leen,

Are you referring to simulated or experimental data?
If you/University have subscription to Elsevier, you will find plenty of good papers dealing with BIPV systems. (Energy and Buildings , Solar Energy, Renewable Energy ). The answer is not straightforward and involves many parameters as you pointed out. I will add few more .. air speed in ventilated PV cavity, PV panel type, transparency, system configuration.

Date: Friday, October 7, 2011, 10:18 PM

Dear all,
?
I am looking for data on the temperature at the roof-site of the solar PV-panels when mounted on a horizontal, tilted or vertical surface as a function of the intensity of the solar radiation and the outdoor conditions (wind and tempearture). This both for PV with a ventilated space below and for those mounted directly on the roof-surface.

This in order to simulate the performance of an alternative thermal solar system.
?
Thanks already for any input!

Message-ID: <CAP9LdPPvHzwd9hzbFW8AZ5hzJ+jN9v7YYGBhaUpaQmeK_uHxqA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have some problem when using Ecotect to make thermal analysis.
In thermal calculation I can get some gains and loads as following:
1. in MONTHLY HEATING/COOLING LOADS, I can get the Max Heating/Cooling loads
and the time
2. in HOURLY GAINS I can choose the particular time in 1 and get the HVAC
load
3. I can get fabric, direct solar.... gains at some particular time and then
make a sum, so I get another gain

I thin there three gains or laods should be the same, but acturally they
aren't. I am confused.

Message-ID: <1AF72AA22F6D1B4CBA603B402ED47F046FB5E30570@AMXEXC02.global.arup.com>

I'm looking for some feedback from anyone who has used EE4 and/or modeled a building against the MNECB 1997 in Canada.


1.       How are the Energy Source Adjustment Factors used when modeling a building for LEED against the MNECB?  It appears that these factors are meant to be multiplied by the total energy cost from each type of use. I see that at least in LEED Canada NC 1.0/1.1, the calculations for EQ p2 require 25% improvement in energy consumption (not cost) over MNECB. Presumably this requires use of the ESAF in that calculation.  However, LEED also requires that calculations for energy savings are based on energy cost. When calculating energy costs, do you have to use the ESAF as well as the different utility rates? Or do you use the actual consumption (without using the ESAF) to figure the cost?

2.       The code appears to require use of baseline systems that completely mirror the proposed systems - boiler for boiler, chiller for chiller, multi-zone for multi-zone.  How have others found ways to show significant energy savings given this constraint?  The newer versions of ASHRAE allow comparison of a proposed ground-source heat pump system, for example, against a boiler heating baseline system, or a VAV system against a packaged system, depending on various factors.  But the MNECB and ASHRAE 90.1-1999 don't allow this.  I am struggling to see how it would be possible to get more than 20-30% savings given these rules.

Thanks,

Item 1 - the ESAF's are used in defining the reference building envelope 
parameters -- that is why you must define the primary heating source for 
each zone.  In practise, you just use the energy consumption & costs 
from EE4 to populate the LEED Canada letter template.  The ESAF's are 
not used in the EA-Cr 1 or EA Pr 2 calculations.

Item 2 - your interpretation is not correct.  There is a document called 
the Performance Compliance for Buildings which defines the reference 
building (automatically generated by EE4).  Roughly translated, the 
reference building has a single 80% efficient boiler (if you have 
hydronic heating in the proposed building, it has 1 or 2 chillers (2 if 
your plant exceeds 700 tons) with a COP of 5.2.  There are 3 reference 
building types -- single zone, residential (hotels, dorms etc) ... and 
everything else which has a VAV reference system type.

The MNECB is and old code very easy to beat.  Standard design should be 
25% better than the MNECB (due mainly to lighting).  Good HVAC design 
(e.g. condensing boilers, dedicated OA systems and ventilation heat 
recovery) can put you 50 to 60% better than the MNECB.  (My office is in 
a building >75% better than the MNECB, but that is another story).

Hi Chou,

I understand that the meaning of these loads are:
Monthly Heating/Cooling loads: it's the monthly average sume of all gains and loses of your space
Hourly gains: it indicates for every hour of a specific day what its the behaviuor of each kind of energy flow
Specific gain hourly or monthly allow you to know the behaviuor of that energy transferEach point allows you to know differents aspects. The first only gives you the total for every month, the second allows you analize what load is important in a specific day and the last aspect allows you to know the anual behaviuor of a specific transfer of energy.

I don't know if it's clearly now or I confuse you more

I know this has been covered before, but I just received the following
comment from a GBCI reviewer for a v3 Core and Shell project I'm working
on.  The project is basically an existing 5-story warehouse with almost
no windows.  Part of the renovation is adding windows.  The comment is
as follows:

 

Table 1.4.1B indicates that the window-to-gross-wall ratio is identical
in both cases; however it is unclear whether any fenestration was added
or removed as part of the renovation. The baseline ratio must reflect
the ratio as it existed prior to the renovation and the proposed ratio
must reflect the ratio as it exists after the renovation. Revise the
Baseline and/or Proposed cases as necessary so that the
window-to-gross-wall ratio is accurately modeled and provide a revised
prerequisite form and updated energy model output summaries as
necessary. 

 

I didn't think that this was the case - I thought that if you had an
existing building, any EXISTING-TO-REMAIN windows would show up as the
existing window type, but any NEW windows in the proposed alteration
would be matched in the baseline model and comply with the Table 5.5
requirements.  Meaning the WWR remained the 1:1 as long as it was < 40%
glass.

 

I think this is just a matter of educating the reviewer on our building,
but I wanted to make sure that there hadn't been a shift in how GBCI
reviews existing buildings.

 

Thanks!

I find existing envelopes always tricky because the information is not
delivered in the clearest manner.  However, I think in this case the
reviewer is correct, based on 90.1 Table G3.1.5 item f under "Baseline
Building Performance" and page G-17 of the User's Manual.  Also, in item c
they explicitly state that it applies to new buildings and additions, but do
not list existing (other than the little blip about alterations and 5.1.3.)

I know this has been covered before, but I just received the following
comment from a GBCI reviewer for a v3 Core and Shell project I'm working on.
The project is basically an existing 5-story warehouse with almost no
windows.  Part of the renovation is adding windows.  The comment is as
follows:

 

Table 1.4.1B indicates that the window-to-gross-wall ratio is identical in
both cases; however it is unclear whether any fenestration was added or
removed as part of the renovation. The baseline ratio must reflect the ratio
as it existed prior to the renovation and the proposed ratio must reflect
the ratio as it exists after the renovation. Revise the Baseline and/or
Proposed cases as necessary so that the window-to-gross-wall ratio is
accurately modeled and provide a revised prerequisite form and updated
energy model output summaries as necessary. 

 

I didn't think that this was the case - I thought that if you had an
existing building, any EXISTING-TO-REMAIN windows would show up as the
existing window type, but any NEW windows in the proposed alteration would
be matched in the baseline model and comply with the Table 5.5 requirements.
Meaning the WWR remained the 1:1 as long as it was < 40% glass.

 

I think this is just a matter of educating the reviewer on our building, but
I wanted to make sure that there hadn't been a shift in how GBCI reviews
existing buildings.

 

Thanks!

Thanks for the responses Anne and Bill.  But this seems ridiculous, and
goes against everything I've done to date.

 

So if we have an existing building with no windows, and we want to reuse
the building structure/skin (which LEED strongly encourages), we get
penalized for wanting some daylight in the building?  

 

I think all of the references to the "baseline building envelope shall
represent existing conditions" is intended to demonstrate that you can
use existing window and wall coefficients, NOT that you can't add
windows.  But what do I know...

 

Does anyone know for sure?

Message-ID: <002a01cc8845$bd4e0670$37ea1350$@sudassociates.com>

Hi Everyone,

 

I have not seen my specific situation adequately addressed in the LEED
documentation, so I would be interested to hear others' opinions on the
matter:  

 

I am modeling a building which relies on a central plant for heating and
cooling.  The plant serves only a few buildings.  Heating enters the
buildings as HW, not steam.  My building is designed such that there are no
hot water pumps.the BAS communicates back to the central plant pump system,
which adjusts flow appropriately.  All flow within the building is
controlled by valves.  My basic question is, in which models do I include HW
pump energy (that's 4 models.Step 1 Baseline and Proposed, and Step 2
Baseline and Proposed)?

 

Here are my thoughts.  For certain I need to include HW pumps in the Step 2
Baseline, as for any Baseline using System 7.  That leaves only 3 models to
ponder.  The LEED guidance I have read leads me to believe I should include
HW pumps in Step 1 Baseline as well.  The intention of Step 1 is to model
the buildings independent of the central plant, which would lead me to not
include the HW pump energy in my Step 1 Proposed model.  Am I now cheating
by including the pump energy in the Baseline but not the Proposed for Step
1?  

 

For Step 2, LEED documentation indicates that secondary pump energy needs to
be modeled in the proposed aggregate building/DES model.  This would lead me
towards not modeling the central plant pumps, but again, is that cheating?
A portion of the central plant pump energy is certainly being used to push
water through my building.

 

Thanks for any thoughts/opinions you may have,

Christian

I also agree with the reviewer.  The existing envelope condition stipulation is a double edged sword.   Do you truly think it is a net penalty on your LEED application to add windows?  Other LEED points reward daylight and views, and the thermal energy impacts of the windows are hopefully offset by electric lighting savings.

I've never done a core & shell model, so take this opinion with a grain
of salt  (it's only my opinion):

 

This reviewer's interpretation seems to make a lot of sense to me.  Have
the baseline represent the actual existing building, and have the
proposed match the actual design.  To my understanding, the only reason
we make them match 1:1 for new construction is there isn't a better
means (like when you have an existing building) to define a baseline
that would treat evenhandedly all building types/climates/circumstances,
so we have them match to at least ensure level playing field.

 

Put another way, and in response to James' query, I think if adding
windows (nice or not) cause the energy bills to go up in an existing
building, then that should be reflected in the energy model.
Simultaneously, if you are interested to add daylighting "in
moderation," and locate/orient glazing & shading devices in a fashion
that lowers the annual bills, then that should also be reflected in the
energy model.  

 

It's important to remember not all exterior glazing is bad from an
energy perspective, particularly when daylighting controls for the
building interior lighting are added into the mix.  WWR is one area
where "engineers and architects" (or "energy and aesthetics," if that
better describes your design team) do not need to be on opposite ends of
the table!

I know this has been covered before, but I just received the following
comment from a GBCI reviewer for a v3 Core and Shell project I'm working
on.  The project is basically an existing 5-story warehouse with almost
no windows.  Part of the renovation is adding windows.  The comment is
as follows:

 

Table 1.4.1B indicates that the window-to-gross-wall ratio is identical
in both cases; however it is unclear whether any fenestration was added
or removed as part of the renovation. The baseline ratio must reflect
the ratio as it existed prior to the renovation and the proposed ratio
must reflect the ratio as it exists after the renovation. Revise the
Baseline and/or Proposed cases as necessary so that the
window-to-gross-wall ratio is accurately modeled and provide a revised
prerequisite form and updated energy model output summaries as
necessary. 

 

I didn't think that this was the case - I thought that if you had an
existing building, any EXISTING-TO-REMAIN windows would show up as the
existing window type, but any NEW windows in the proposed alteration
would be matched in the baseline model and comply with the Table 5.5
requirements.  Meaning the WWR remained the 1:1 as long as it was < 40%
glass.

 

I think this is just a matter of educating the reviewer on our building,
but I wanted to make sure that there hadn't been a shift in how GBCI
reviews existing buildings.

Well wait a second - if I have a building with no windows, and I go to
one with say 40% glass, there is going to be a huge increase in energy
consumption, and we can't assume it will be offset by daylight
harvesting as that is an expensive thing for a spec office building
developer (as an example) to provide.  And this particular building is
not getting any of the daylight and views credits because of shape. (so
Paul, it is truly a net penalty to add windows, especially since we're
talking about at least 2 or 3 EAc1 pts).

 

There is only a 4% savings delta in the point thresholds for new
buildings vs existing buildings (3 pts under CS is 8% for existing
buildings and 12% for new buildings).

 

I can almost guarantee that if I am comparing a baseline existing
building with no glass to a proposed building with 40% glass, it will
show substantially worse savings than if I was comparing a baseline new
building with 40% glass to a proposed building with 40% glass.  And by
substantially, I mean more than 4% worse.

 

With that in mind, I would actually BENEFIT from treating the baseline
building as a new building.  That doesn't seem right ?? 

 

But I appreciate everyone's input.  I guess I've just "snuck" 3 or 4
existing building projects thru the system.

I've never done a core & shell model, so take this opinion with a grain
of salt  (it's only my opinion):

 

This reviewer's interpretation seems to make a lot of sense to me.  Have
the baseline represent the actual existing building, and have the
proposed match the actual design.  To my understanding, the only reason
we make them match 1:1 for new construction is there isn't a better
means (like when you have an existing building) to define a baseline
that would treat evenhandedly all building types/climates/circumstances,
so we have them match to at least ensure level playing field.

 

Put another way, and in response to James' query, I think if adding
windows (nice or not) cause the energy bills to go up in an existing
building, then that should be reflected in the energy model.
Simultaneously, if you are interested to add daylighting "in
moderation," and locate/orient glazing & shading devices in a fashion
that lowers the annual bills, then that should also be reflected in the
energy model.  

 

It's important to remember not all exterior glazing is bad from an
energy perspective, particularly when daylighting controls for the
building interior lighting are added into the mix.  WWR is one area
where "engineers and architects" (or "energy and aesthetics," if that
better describes your design team) do not need to be on opposite ends of
the table!

I also agree with the reviewer.  The existing envelope condition
stipulation is a double edged sword.   Do you truly think it is a net
penalty on your LEED application to add windows?  Other LEED points
reward daylight and views, and the thermal energy impacts of the windows
are hopefully offset by electric lighting savings.

Thanks for the responses Anne and Bill.  But this seems ridiculous, and
goes against everything I've done to date.

 

So if we have an existing building with no windows, and we want to reuse
the building structure/skin (which LEED strongly encourages), we get
penalized for wanting some daylight in the building?  

 

I think all of the references to the "baseline building envelope shall
represent existing conditions" is intended to demonstrate that you can
use existing window and wall coefficients, NOT that you can't add
windows.  But what do I know...

 

Does anyone know for sure?

I find existing envelopes always tricky because the information is not
delivered in the clearest manner.  However, I think in this case the
reviewer is correct, based on 90.1 Table G3.1.5 item f under "Baseline
Building Performance" and page G-17 of the User's Manual.  Also, in item
c they explicitly state that it applies to new buildings and additions,
but do not list existing (other than the little blip about alterations
and 5.1.3.)

I know this has been covered before, but I just received the following
comment from a GBCI reviewer for a v3 Core and Shell project I'm working
on.  The project is basically an existing 5-story warehouse with almost
no windows.  Part of the renovation is adding windows.  The comment is
as follows:

 

Table 1.4.1B indicates that the window-to-gross-wall ratio is identical
in both cases; however it is unclear whether any fenestration was added
or removed as part of the renovation. The baseline ratio must reflect
the ratio as it existed prior to the renovation and the proposed ratio
must reflect the ratio as it exists after the renovation. Revise the
Baseline and/or Proposed cases as necessary so that the
window-to-gross-wall ratio is accurately modeled and provide a revised
prerequisite form and updated energy model output summaries as
necessary. 

 

I didn't think that this was the case - I thought that if you had an
existing building, any EXISTING-TO-REMAIN windows would show up as the
existing window type, but any NEW windows in the proposed alteration
would be matched in the baseline model and comply with the Table 5.5
requirements.  Meaning the WWR remained the 1:1 as long as it was < 40%
glass.

 

I think this is just a matter of educating the reviewer on our building,
but I wanted to make sure that there hadn't been a shift in how GBCI
reviews existing buildings.

 

Thanks!

One more follow up question:  what if the entire building skin was
removed and replaced with new?  What the skin go to the minimum ASHRAE
90.1 values and whatever glass percentage is in the proposed building?

Hi James,

In oder to answer your last question, two things should be clarified as
flollows:

1. Appendix G is designated for New and Major renovation Projects;
2. As per SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE TO THE MINIMUM PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS (R2), "
*Major Renovation: *Includes extensive alteration work in addition to work
on the exterior shell of the building and/or primary structural
components and/or
the core and peripheral MEP and service systems and/or site work. Typically,
the extent and nature of the work is such that the primary function
space cannot
be used for its intended purpose while the work is in progress and where a
new certificate of occupancy is required before the work area can be
reoccupied."

Your project falls into an existing building undergoing renovation or major
renovation will make big difference, I guess.

Regards,
Cheney

James, your logic and resulting conclusions appear spot on to me, for
what it's worth =).

 

NC buildings do seem to have an easier time being designed as a fishbowl
than existing buildings turning into one (speaking qualitatively here).
I could only speculate as to whether that's by design or accident on
USGBC's part.  My guess is it's an unintentional result of NC baselines
being necessarily more arbitrary-to-reality.  Perhaps this
"difficulty-gap" between NC and EB modeling is something the EA tag
committee could or has already addressed? 

 

I think you can take your conclusions a step further and say that the
present LEED system holistically, through the energy modeling credits
and their relative importance in v3 onwards, is very much discouraging
allocating your project budget towards converting existing buildings
envelopes to glass walls, and conversely encouraging spending your
dollars elsewhere to net a "more green" energy result...  In the "spec
office scenario" below with daylighting credits out of the picture, it
would appear LEED is giving a clear NO signal to any window/shading
upgrade that doesn't provide a net energy benefit on its own.  

 

Speaking outside of the confines of LEED, I won't say this is
necessarily reasonable... I personally would work more productively in a
relatively inefficient office with a great view than a more efficient
cave - which would result in more quality building systems getting
designed for the world to enjoy ;).  LEED by its nature has an
inescapable "social policy" side where value judgements are being made
in spite of what building design professionals and owners know/ think.
Constructively, perhaps the rules could be improved from "never install
glazing" to encourage "install glazing and do a quality job of
minimizing the negative energy impact."  That's what we'd do without
such constraints.  Then again, perhaps the powers-that-be cannot accept
that daylighting/views have an impact that is not measureable in a
utility bill... or perhaps those powers need to spend some extended time
in a cubicle farm?  :-)  

 

Again, haven't done a LEED-EB model myself, so I'm only speaking from my
"outside the LEED box" renovation modeling experience.

 

I also emphatically agree daylighting controls are not a panacea to
energies burned/lost with windows (and even if they were, they're too
expensive to be treated that way responsibly), but should be budgeted
and considered as part of a cohesive & deliberate window/shading/space
layout strategy.  The concept of "ideal WWR" becomes a very dynamic,
complex and climate/project-specific problem when daylighting controls
are involved...  All the more reason to engage (and compensate) your
energy modelers early in design, though I know I'm preaching to the
choir!

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] LEED and existing envelopes

 

Well wait a second - if I have a building with no windows, and I go to
one with say 40% glass, there is going to be a huge increase in energy
consumption, and we can't assume it will be offset by daylight
harvesting as that is an expensive thing for a spec office building
developer (as an example) to provide.  And this particular building is
not getting any of the daylight and views credits because of shape. (so
Paul, it is truly a net penalty to add windows, especially since we're
talking about at least 2 or 3 EAc1 pts).

 

There is only a 4% savings delta in the point thresholds for new
buildings vs existing buildings (3 pts under CS is 8% for existing
buildings and 12% for new buildings).

 

I can almost guarantee that if I am comparing a baseline existing
building with no glass to a proposed building with 40% glass, it will
show substantially worse savings than if I was comparing a baseline new
building with 40% glass to a proposed building with 40% glass.  And by
substantially, I mean more than 4% worse.

 

With that in mind, I would actually BENEFIT from treating the baseline
building as a new building.  That doesn't seem right ?? 

 

But I appreciate everyone's input.  I guess I've just "snuck" 3 or 4
existing building projects thru the system.

I've never done a core & shell model, so take this opinion with a grain
of salt  (it's only my opinion):

 

This reviewer's interpretation seems to make a lot of sense to me.  Have
the baseline represent the actual existing building, and have the
proposed match the actual design.  To my understanding, the only reason
we make them match 1:1 for new construction is there isn't a better
means (like when you have an existing building) to define a baseline
that would treat evenhandedly all building types/climates/circumstances,
so we have them match to at least ensure level playing field.

 

Put another way, and in response to James' query, I think if adding
windows (nice or not) cause the energy bills to go up in an existing
building, then that should be reflected in the energy model.
Simultaneously, if you are interested to add daylighting "in
moderation," and locate/orient glazing & shading devices in a fashion
that lowers the annual bills, then that should also be reflected in the
energy model.  

 

It's important to remember not all exterior glazing is bad from an
energy perspective, particularly when daylighting controls for the
building interior lighting are added into the mix.  WWR is one area
where "engineers and architects" (or "energy and aesthetics," if that
better describes your design team) do not need to be on opposite ends of
the table!

I also agree with the reviewer.  The existing envelope condition
stipulation is a double edged sword.   Do you truly think it is a net
penalty on your LEED application to add windows?  Other LEED points
reward daylight and views, and the thermal energy impacts of the windows
are hopefully offset by electric lighting savings.

Thanks for the responses Anne and Bill.  But this seems ridiculous, and
goes against everything I've done to date.

 

So if we have an existing building with no windows, and we want to reuse
the building structure/skin (which LEED strongly encourages), we get
penalized for wanting some daylight in the building?  

 

I think all of the references to the "baseline building envelope shall
represent existing conditions" is intended to demonstrate that you can
use existing window and wall coefficients, NOT that you can't add
windows.  But what do I know...

 

Does anyone know for sure?

I find existing envelopes always tricky because the information is not
delivered in the clearest manner.  However, I think in this case the
reviewer is correct, based on 90.1 Table G3.1.5 item f under "Baseline
Building Performance" and page G-17 of the User's Manual.  Also, in item
c they explicitly state that it applies to new buildings and additions,
but do not list existing (other than the little blip about alterations

I know this has been covered before, but I just received the following
comment from a GBCI reviewer for a v3 Core and Shell project I'm working
on.  The project is basically an existing 5-story warehouse with almost
no windows.  Part of the renovation is adding windows.  The comment is
as follows:

 

Table 1.4.1B indicates that the window-to-gross-wall ratio is identical
in both cases; however it is unclear whether any fenestration was added
or removed as part of the renovation. The baseline ratio must reflect
the ratio as it existed prior to the renovation and the proposed ratio
must reflect the ratio as it exists after the renovation. Revise the
Baseline and/or Proposed cases as necessary so that the
window-to-gross-wall ratio is accurately modeled and provide a revised
prerequisite form and updated energy model output summaries as
necessary. 

 

I didn't think that this was the case - I thought that if you had an
existing building, any EXISTING-TO-REMAIN windows would show up as the
existing window type, but any NEW windows in the proposed alteration
would be matched in the baseline model and comply with the Table 5.5
requirements.  Meaning the WWR remained the 1:1 as long as it was < 40%
glass.

 

I think this is just a matter of educating the reviewer on our building,
but I wanted to make sure that there hadn't been a shift in how GBCI
reviews existing buildings.

 

Thanks!

Whether the models already incorporate these loads in some fashion will determine whether you need to add or subtract to illustrate the point.

Aaron's suggestion should be fairly straightforward:

*         Save a copy of your proposed/baseline models as they are - you'll reference them later.

*         In a new separate case, modify your proposed case to include the variance you desire to the lighting loads. This will constitute your ECM, and your savings over your proposed case would be input into the template as the ECM savings. This will incorporate the models' predicted additional heating / reduced cooling required from your lighting loads.

*         Space equipment loads and lighting loads will by default reject wattage as sensible heat to the space and/or plenum in some fraction.  Modify if necessary.  Defining these as a lighting load would make inputs simpler if you desire to reject a percentage to plenum.

*         Since this tangent came up recently on another thread:  Note that treating lighting input wattages as a 100% sensible heat load is entirely appropriate for conventional lighting sources in a building.  Generally only a small fraction of input watts is converted into light energy in our visible spectrum.  Some (not most) LED solutions, green lasers and oddball stars in the sky are exceptions to the rule in strict terms of luminous efficacy, but even then it's a moot point unless you're largely directing your lights outside a window - it's all ultimately a heat load in your space.

*         These loads should have unique scheduling assigned to match your description/calculations

*         The baseline and proposed loads should differ in magnitude per your description/calculations

*         When done, your models will reflect the savings targeted, and these lights' effects on cooling/heating consumption.  The models figure out the heating/cooling impact stuff in the course of an ordinary simulation

*         When done, set up a few parametric runs in any one model: Use that "based on another file" parametric run option, and simply reference  your proposed/baseline models (.inp) with and without the added/re-defined loads.  A parametric run will result in reports that show all consumptions for all 4 iterations side-by-side.  Should be a perfect illustration to include with your response.

Ashraf -

I believe it is acceptable for your "exceptional calculation" to actually be an additional energy model case.

I agree that you are taking the right approach with respect to the CIR mentioned.

Based on earlier correspondence I'm assuming you have provided adequate documentation assuring the reviewer that your selected lighting power reductions are justified.

Could you then incorporate these revised LPD numbers into an additional case of the proposed model, done to the side?

This would give you an "exceptional savings", incorporating lighting savings as well as potential cooling savings / heating increases...

Exceptional calculations performed for Residential building, LEED NC V2.2. Interior lighting calculations performed based on the CIR dated on 3/23/2007.

As CIR states that all hard-wired lighting in living units that is shown on the building plans should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed building simulations as shown in the plans. This lighting shall be considered process energy. Also it states that credit can be taken for an efficient lighting design in the living unit using the Exceptional Calculations Methodology. It suggests the figures schedule near 2 hours a day or less for hard-wired residential fixtures.


For an example in Bedroom baseline calculated as 2 W/sqft with occupancy of 2 hours a day and for propose case 1 W/sqft with same 2 hours a days. A similar calculation has performed for entire building and I achieved 40% savings in wattages.



Then reduction of wattage we are showing in Section 1.7 - Exceptional Calculation Measure Summary. So leed reviewer is requesting to provide heating impact on cooling and shown the calculations with zone wise and to incorporate in energy model and Template.

Ashraf

Hi Nick,

I can not agree with you more. Ashraf will have to answer why such 40% reduction is not reflected in the original energy modeling.

The only divergence is the example with which you believe the appliances fall into "plug loads" whereas I believe they could be "process one". Again, it really depends on which LEED system (2009 or older version) we are using. No process loads will be included in modeling under the old LEED system. In another words, no penalty for heating due to reduced process load. However, your methodology is accurate under the new LEED since both plug load and process load should be involved in energy modeling.

Cheney

Good point Cheney!

I suppose I have a more general understanding that "exceptional calculations" exist for when you have designed energy saving measures which cannot be credited following 90.1/LEED "to the letter."

To use your example of improved appliance efficiencies, my intuition would be to produce extra documentation/calculations to substantiate a certain % reduction in installed plug loads, then I'd apply that reduction to the proposed model.  These calculations and a brief description of how they were compiled and applied to the proposed model would be uploaded and referenced alongside the modeling templates.  Perhaps my terminology is off and this is not really an "exceptional calculation?"

But to clarify for the topic at hand, I suppose my response might best include another query: what is this hard-wiring strategy and why isn't it already in the model?  It's possible an LPD reduction would not adequately reflect whatever is really going on.

Well, my understanding is that exceptional calculation is used to document meansres that may not be adequately modelled in a simulaiton program. Some examples are lab exhaust system, appliance efficiencies in high-rise residential building, etc. How do you define your hard-wired lighting calculation from this point of view?

Remodeling with reduded LPD is necessary provided your hard-wired lighting reduction affects internal heat gain and you would expect more heating energy in this manner. I guess it is what the reviewer expect to see unless you can  prove him/her that your reduction will not trigger heating/cooling energy variation.

I think something is missing in the story here...

A reduction of lighting consumption is claimed to reduce heating consumption?

As you say, lights are an internal heat source to some extent... reducing the lighting energy consumed by a significant fraction should cause a relative increase in heating and a reduction of cooling energies, right?  I'm going to assume the reviewer's vocabulary is simply flipped around and this is the point they were trying to make:  Changing lighting should affect heating/cooling consumptions.

As to how you document this - It would seem simplest if you simply worked your "exceptionally calculated" reduction back into the model.   From your description I don't know exactly what your "hard-wiring" strategy is that's chopping off 40%, but applying a factor to the space LPD's may be a decent approach.  You could then demonstrate before/after results showing lighting/heating/cooling consumptions moving about by setting up  a parametric run and using those reports.

I have performed Exceptional calculations in EAC1 credit for internal hard-wired lighting. I achieved savings up to 40%.

In Preliminary review, I received below comment

"It is does not appear as if the reduction in heating consumption was considered. Address the reduction in space heating and ensure the consumption is appropriately reduced, and provide a revised template and updated energy model output summaries reflecting the changes."


As light generates heating, so leed reviewer is requesting to provide the heating consumption calculations and to achieve more savings as it directly impact on cooling, even though calculations performed exceptionally.

Could you please guide how to perform these heating consumption calculations and how to incorporate in energy model and Template with reference?

Thanks,

Hi Paula



Thanks for your patient reply. You explained the 3 items in details, but my
question still exists. For each item:

1.  The function "Monthly Heating/Cooling loads" also provides the max
heating/cooling loads with unit of Btu/hr, in addition to the monthly
average sum of all gains and losses of your space. And the former item is
what I called the 1st loads.



2. The function "Hourly gains/losses" provides the gains of each kind of
energy flow by hour on any particular day, so we can get the hourly
gains/losses on the hottest/coldest day. That particular gains/losses makes
the max cooling/heating loads and this item is what I called the 2nd loads.



3. Behavior of specific transfer of energy is provided with the average
hourly value by month, the hourly value is kind of gains, so if I focus at
the right month and hour, and make sum of all the specific hourly gains I
can get the max cooling/heating loads. That is what I called the 3rd loads



In this way, the three functions can reflect the same index, the max
cooling/heating loads and I think they should be consistent with each other,
but actually they don't.



I hope I present the issues clearly.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <1318422931.10078.YahooMailNeo@web95906.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Dear?Energy Simulators
?
I have to model Under Floor Air Distribution (UFAD)?for one of LEED projects. I went through the?document at the link http://www.energydesignresources.com/media/2654/EDR_DesignGuidelines_%20HVAC_Simulation.pdf?to model UFAD in eQUEST. The major assumption in this method to model UFAD is to create a plenum zone,?to model the effect of a thermally stratified zone?above the occupied zone,?and transfer a fraction of People (25%), Lighting (33%) and Equipment (33%) loads in that zone.
?
Is this method to model UFAD acceptable for simulations carried out to show LEED compliance? Has anyone else used this method before? Or is there any other method to model UFAD?
?
Your?comments would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Thanks for this information, Bob.  You are correct that I'm referring to the
earlier guideline (Required Treatment of District Thermal Energy in LEED
Version 2.2 and LEED for Schools, Version 1.0, 2008). 

 

I should have been clearer in my post:  This is a LEED 2.2 project, and the
model was originally created using the Version 1 guidance referenced above.
This project was started before the newer 2010 document (Version 2).  The
model was submitted using the Step 1, Step 2 method of Version 1.  I am now
trying to address the reviewer's comments.  I did not create the original
model, but I have inherited it since the original modeler is not here any
longer.  For addressing the comments, I think I should maintain the Version
1 format in which we submitted.

 

I'll do what seems to be most fair and accurate based on what I read in both
documents and the main intent of apples-to-apples comparisons.  I was just
hoping someone else out there had come across this situation.

 

Thanks again,

Christian

Hi Everyone,

 

I have not seen my specific situation adequately addressed in the LEED
documentation, so I would be interested to hear others' opinions on the
matter:  

 

I am modeling a building which relies on a central plant for heating and
cooling.  The plant serves only a few buildings.  Heating enters the
buildings as HW, not steam.  My building is designed such that there are no
hot water pumps.the BAS communicates back to the central plant pump system,
which adjusts flow appropriately.  All flow within the building is
controlled by valves.  My basic question is, in which models do I include HW
pump energy (that's 4 models.Step 1 Baseline and Proposed, and Step 2
Baseline and Proposed)?

 

Here are my thoughts.  For certain I need to include HW pumps in the Step 2
Baseline, as for any Baseline using System 7.  That leaves only 3 models to
ponder.  The LEED guidance I have read leads me to believe I should include
HW pumps in Step 1 Baseline as well.  The intention of Step 1 is to model
the buildings independent of the central plant, which would lead me to not
include the HW pump energy in my Step 1 Proposed model.  Am I now cheating
by including the pump energy in the Baseline but not the Proposed for Step
1?  

 

For Step 2, LEED documentation indicates that secondary pump energy needs to
be modeled in the proposed aggregate building/DES model.  This would lead me
towards not modeling the central plant pumps, but again, is that cheating?
A portion of the central plant pump energy is certainly being used to push
water through my building.

 

Thanks for any thoughts/opinions you may have,

Christian

I haven't seen much discussion on this forum in regards to EnergyPro.  It
doesn't look like there is a separate EnergyPro specific list on
onebuilding.org.  If you have a question, the bldg-sim list would be the
most appropriate place to pose it.

The main resource I used when I was stumbling my way through my first
EnergyPro model was to directly e-mail their technical support at
support at energysoft.com.  There is a Yahoo user's group at
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EnergyPro/, however the discussion there
is infrequent and almost all of it seems geared towards California Title-24
compliance.

If you're trying to do anything other than T24 compliance I would highly
recommend you stay away from EnergyPro.  The program has a steep learning
curve, is not great for modeling any sort of complex building or system, and
there is little support available.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Existing Site Lighting for LEED Energy Modeling
Message-ID: <88DC4C3C646DD5119B0D0002A537FD68194D7861@madison.corp.epstein-isi.com>

Has anyone dealt with how to model existing site lighting for a LEED project? Should we be modeling both  the proposed and baseline models with the existing fixtures or go through the motions of calculating baseline allowance through 90.1 for the baseline model and model the existing fixtures on the proposed design?

 

My intuition is that we go with the first strategy and model site lighting as the same on both (essential "neutral")

 

Thanks!

Message-ID: <4E95CED1.4000906@gmail.com>

All,

I have just updated the syllabus for the upcoming EnergyPlus training 
(3-5 Nov 2011) in Salt Lake City, UT.

Its exciting to watch how the simulation tools in general, and 
EnergyPlus in particular, becomes more and more user-friendly. At the 
same time, it is challenging to keep up with the new topics that needs 
to be included in the workshop. Nevertheless, I have updated the 
syllabus to reflect recent changes in EnergyPlus (with the upcoming 
release of v7, hopefully in time for this workshop) and OpenStudio, the 
EnergyPlus interface that is used in the workshop. The new syllabus 
still maintains the philosophy of the workshop, i.e. the workshop is 
open for both architects and engineers, and all other professions in 
building design who are interested in energy simulation.

Please have a look at the syllabus here:

Thanks,

Ery

Subject:  [Bldg-sim] Modelling UFAD for LEED

Dear Energy Simulators
 
I have to model Under Floor Air Distribution (UFAD) for one of LEED
projects. I went through the document at the link
http://www.energydesignresources.com/media/2654/EDR_DesignGuidelines_%20HVAC
_Simulation.pdf to model UFAD in eQUEST. The major assumption in this method
to model UFAD is to create a plenum zone, to model the effect of a thermally
stratified zone above the occupied zone, and transfer a fraction of People
(25%), Lighting (33%) and Equipment (33%) loads in that zone.
 
Is this method to model UFAD acceptable for simulations carried out to show
LEED compliance? Has anyone else used this method before? Or is there any
other method to model UFAD?
 
Your comments would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
 
Regards
Ethen

You need to have an apples to apples comparison, and you need to account for
the pump energy. 

As you indicate, the Step 2 baseline, is a standalone building, System #7,
with pump energy included.

Your step 2 Proposed Case should account for the all pumping energy in some
way. You have variable primary pumping, so the requirement to model
secondary pumping in the building is not applicable, but you still need to
account for all the pumping energy. Whether it is modeled in the plant or
building is irrelevant. I'd probably model it in the building for simplicity
sake. 

Your step 1 models should have identical plant conditions. If all the
pumping is in the plant, then I would leave the pump energy out of both
Step 1 cases.

Thanks for this information, Bob.  You are correct that I?m referring to the
earlier guideline (Required Treatment of District Thermal Energy in LEED
Version 2.2 and LEED for Schools, Version 1.0, 2008).
 
I should have been clearer in my post:  This is a LEED 2.2 project, and the
model was originally created using the Version 1 guidance referenced above.
This project was started before the newer 2010 document (Version 2).  The
model was submitted using the Step 1, Step 2 method of Version 1.  I am now
trying to address the reviewer?s comments.  I did not create the original
model, but I have inherited it since the original modeler is not here any
longer.  For addressing the comments, I think I should maintain the Version
1 format in which we submitted.
 
I?ll do what seems to be most fair and accurate based on what I read in both
documents and the main intent of apples-to-apples comparisons.  I was just
hoping someone else out there had come across this situation.
 
Thanks again,

Hi Everyone,
 
I have not seen my specific situation adequately addressed in the LEED
documentation, so I would be interested to hear others? opinions on the
matter:  
 
I am modeling a building which relies on a central plant for heating and
cooling.  The plant serves only a few buildings.  Heating enters the
buildings as HW, not steam.  My building is designed such that there are no
hot water pumps?the BAS communicates back to the central plant pump system,
which adjusts flow appropriately.  All flow within the building is
controlled by valves.  My basic question is, in which models do I include HW
pump energy (that?s 4 models?Step 1 Baseline and Proposed, and Step 2
Baseline and Proposed)?
 
Here are my thoughts.  For certain I need to include HW pumps in the Step 2
Baseline, as for any Baseline using System 7.  That leaves only 3 models to
ponder.  The LEED guidance I have read leads me to believe I should include
HW pumps in Step 1 Baseline as well.  The intention of Step 1 is to model
the buildings independent of the central plant, which would lead me to not
include the HW pump energy in my Step 1 Proposed model.  Am I now cheating
by including the pump energy in the Baseline but not the Proposed for Step
1?  
 
For Step 2, LEED documentation indicates that secondary pump energy needs to
be modeled in the proposed aggregate building/DES model.  This would lead me
towards not modeling the central plant pumps, but again, is that cheating?
A portion of the central plant pump energy is certainly being used to push
water through my building?
 
Thanks for any thoughts/opinions you may have,
Christian

Ethen,

With your LEED submission, include a supporting narrative with precise and consistent with use of the terms UFAD and thermal displacement ventilation (TDV).  Not all  UFAD systems achieve TDV throughout the zone  and not all systems that do deliver air under the floor.  The EDR simulation guidelines and the design briefs do a decent job of distinguishing these facts.  The design briefs also pick up on the zone air distribution effectiveness (Table 6-2) of ASHRAE Standard 62.    I strongly believe that designs and energy models should incorporate the impact of air distribution effectiveness.

Good luck,

A very good tool is DView.

I know it does EPW files and EPW CSV files.  Not sure if it can handle others.

Hi Ramana,

You could take a look at dview from NREL:

    http://www.nrel.gov/csp/troughnet/models_tools.html#dview

I believe that it lets you select what component data from a weather 
file to graph. I do not recall off hand if you can define the 
range/period that you want to look at.

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

All,

We're running into a similar issue on a project using the newer guidance and the default standard cooling system COP of 4.4 as we know very little about our plant itself - though they do seem to be using variable speed secondary pumps.  Our building itself has no pumps - all pumping is central.

The COP of 4.4 is meant to include the central plant pumping - but it's unclear whether this would also cover the case where all pumping is central.  Do we model the total central plant at a COP of 4.4 and include no pumping energy in our building or do we add pumps equal to the baseline in our building assuming that this 4.4 wasn't allowing for that extent of pumping?

We'd like to meet the intent of the guidance, but also not unfairly penalize the project by being overly conservative.  As we're not sure how the 4.4 was derived, it's difficult to know where to go.

What do you think?

Thanks for any thoughts
Corinne

That makes perfect sense to me.  This is the approach which seems to best follow the intent of the LEED modeling process.

You need to have an apples to apples comparison, and you need to account for the pump energy.

As you indicate, the Step 2 baseline, is a standalone building, System #7, with pump energy included.

Your step 2 Proposed Case should account for the all pumping energy in some way. You have variable primary pumping, so the requirement to model secondary pumping in the building is not applicable, but you still need to account for all the pumping energy. Whether it is modeled in the plant or building is irrelevant. I'd probably model it in the building for simplicity sake.

Your step 1 models should have identical plant conditions. If all the pumping is in the plant, then I would leave the pump energy out of both  Step 1 cases.

Thanks for this information, Bob.  You are correct that I'm referring to the earlier guideline (Required Treatment of District Thermal Energy in LEED Version 2.2 and LEED for Schools, Version 1.0, 2008).

I should have been clearer in my post:  This is a LEED 2.2 project, and the model was originally created using the Version 1 guidance referenced above.  This project was started before the newer 2010 document (Version 2).  The model was submitted using the Step 1, Step 2 method of Version 1.  I am now trying to address the reviewer's comments.  I did not create the original model, but I have inherited it since the original modeler is not here any longer.  For addressing the comments, I think I should maintain the Version 1 format in which we submitted.

I'll do what seems to be most fair and accurate based on what I read in both documents and the main intent of apples-to-apples comparisons.  I was just hoping someone else out there had come across this situation.

Thanks again,
Christian

I think you may be referring to an outdated USGBC guideline...The most current is here http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=7671 You should only have to model option one OR option two, whichever you believe to be more beneficial.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Treatment of District Systems Pump Energy

Hi Everyone,

I have not seen my specific situation adequately addressed in the LEED documentation, so I would be interested to hear others' opinions on the matter:

I am modeling a building which relies on a central plant for heating and cooling.  The plant serves only a few buildings.  Heating enters the buildings as HW, not steam.  My building is designed such that there are no hot water pumps...the BAS communicates back to the central plant pump system, which adjusts flow appropriately.  All flow within the building is controlled by valves.  My basic question is, in which models do I include HW pump energy (that's 4 models...Step 1 Baseline and Proposed, and Step 2 Baseline and Proposed)?

Here are my thoughts.  For certain I need to include HW pumps in the Step 2 Baseline, as for any Baseline using System 7.  That leaves only 3 models to ponder.  The LEED guidance I have read leads me to believe I should include HW pumps in Step 1 Baseline as well.  The intention of Step 1 is to model the buildings independent of the central plant, which would lead me to not include the HW pump energy in my Step 1 Proposed model.  Am I now cheating by including the pump energy in the Baseline but not the Proposed for Step 1?

For Step 2, LEED documentation indicates that secondary pump energy needs to be modeled in the proposed aggregate building/DES model.  This would lead me towards not modeling the central plant pumps, but again, is that cheating?  A portion of the central plant pump energy is certainly being used to push water through my building...

Thanks for any thoughts/opinions you may have,
Christian

You should use e+ for this kind of analysis. It has a couple of stratified

Dear Energy Simulators

I have to model Under Floor Air Distribution (UFAD) for one of LEED projects. I went through the document at the link http://www.energydesignresources.com/media/2654/EDR_DesignGuidelines_%20HVAC_Simulation.pdf to model UFAD in eQUEST. The major assumption in this method to model UFAD is to create a plenum zone, to model the effect of a thermally stratified zone above the occupied zone, and transfer a fraction of People (25%), Lighting (33%) and Equipment (33%) loads in that zone.

Is this method to model UFAD acceptable for simulations carried out to show LEED compliance? Has anyone else used this method before? Or is there any other method to model UFAD?

Your comments would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Hi everyone

During last week greenbuild at toronto i met a reviewer i and ask her what
kind of baseline system should i have when using biomass as heating fuel in
the proposed system.
She give me a different 'view': i should consider using biomass in both
buildings, so i could only take advantage of the energy efficiency of the
bioler (furnace) in the proposed, then i should consider the most used
system's efficiency  in the zone.
what do you think?, still confusing for me!

Actually, existing building envelopes are generally pretty poor
performers.  Upgrading insulation levels usually  makes up for any small
penalties associated with adding a few windows, especially if high
performance glazing is used in any windows that are replaced.  I've found
it's much easier to get EA Credit 1 point in existing buildings than in
new construction.  One other simple way to get benefit in existing
buildings is by reducing infiltration rates by tightening up the envelope.
We generally try to do before and after blower door tests in existing
buildings and do an ECM to take credit for decreased infiltration.

James, your logic and resulting conclusions appear spot on to me, for what
it's worth =).

 

NC buildings do seem to have an easier time being designed as a fishbowl
than existing buildings turning into one (speaking qualitatively here).  I
could only speculate as to whether that's by design or accident on USGBC's
part.  My guess is it's an unintentional result of NC baselines being
necessarily more arbitrary-to-reality.  Perhaps this "difficulty-gap"
between NC and EB modeling is something the EA tag committee could or has
already addressed? 

 

I think you can take your conclusions a step further and say that the
present LEED system holistically, through the energy modeling credits and
their relative importance in v3 onwards, is very much discouraging
allocating your project budget towards converting existing buildings
envelopes to glass walls, and conversely encouraging spending your dollars
elsewhere to net a "more green" energy result.  In the "spec office
scenario" below with daylighting credits out of the picture, it would
appear LEED is giving a clear NO signal to any window/shading upgrade that
doesn't provide a net energy benefit on its own.  

 

Speaking outside of the confines of LEED, I won't say this is necessarily
reasonable. I personally would work more productively in a relatively
inefficient office with a great view than a more efficient cave - which
would result in more quality building systems getting designed for the
world to enjoy ;).  LEED by its nature has an inescapable "social policy"
side where value judgements are being made in spite of what building
design professionals and owners know/ think.  Constructively, perhaps the
rules could be improved from "never install glazing" to encourage "install
glazing and do a quality job of minimizing the negative energy impact."
That's what we'd do without such constraints.  Then again, perhaps the
powers-that-be cannot accept that daylighting/views have an impact that is
not measureable in a utility bill. or perhaps those powers need to spend
some extended time in a cubicle farm?  :-)  

 

Again, haven't done a LEED-EB model myself, so I'm only speaking from my
"outside the LEED box" renovation modeling experience.

 

I also emphatically agree daylighting controls are not a panacea to
energies burned/lost with windows (and even if they were, they're too
expensive to be treated that way responsibly), but should be budgeted and
considered as part of a cohesive & deliberate window/shading/space layout
strategy.  The concept of "ideal WWR" becomes a very dynamic, complex and
climate/project-specific problem when daylighting controls are involved.
All the more reason to engage (and compensate) your energy modelers early
in design, though I know I'm preaching to the choir!

Well wait a second - if I have a building with no windows, and I go to one
with say 40% glass, there is going to be a huge increase in energy
consumption, and we can't assume it will be offset by daylight harvesting
as that is an expensive thing for a spec office building developer (as an
example) to provide.  And this particular building is not getting any of
the daylight and views credits because of shape. (so Paul, it is truly a
net penalty to add windows, especially since we're talking about at least
2 or 3 EAc1 pts).

 

There is only a 4% savings delta in the point thresholds for new buildings
vs existing buildings (3 pts under CS is 8% for existing buildings and 12%
for new buildings).

 

I can almost guarantee that if I am comparing a baseline existing building
with no glass to a proposed building with 40% glass, it will show
substantially worse savings than if I was comparing a baseline new
building with 40% glass to a proposed building with 40% glass.  And by
substantially, I mean more than 4% worse.

 

With that in mind, I would actually BENEFIT from treating the baseline
building as a new building.  That doesn't seem right ?? 

 

But I appreciate everyone's input.  I guess I've just "snuck" 3 or 4
existing building projects thru the system.

I've never done a core & shell model, so take this opinion with a grain of
salt  (it's only my opinion):

 

This reviewer's interpretation seems to make a lot of sense to me.  Have
the baseline represent the actual existing building, and have the proposed
match the actual design.  To my understanding, the only reason we make
them match 1:1 for new construction is there isn't a better means (like
when you have an existing building) to define a baseline that would treat
evenhandedly all building types/climates/circumstances, so we have them
match to at least ensure level playing field.

 

Put another way, and in response to James' query, I think if adding
windows (nice or not) cause the energy bills to go up in an existing
building, then that should be reflected in the energy model.
Simultaneously, if you are interested to add daylighting "in moderation,"
and locate/orient glazing & shading devices in a fashion that lowers the
annual bills, then that should also be reflected in the energy model.  

 

It's important to remember not all exterior glazing is bad from an energy
perspective, particularly when daylighting controls for the building
interior lighting are added into the mix.  WWR is one area where
"engineers and architects" (or "energy and aesthetics," if that better
describes your design team) do not need to be on opposite ends of the
table!

I also agree with the reviewer.  The existing envelope condition
stipulation is a double edged sword.   Do you truly think it is a net
penalty on your LEED application to add windows?  Other LEED points reward
daylight and views, and the thermal energy impacts of the windows are
hopefully offset by electric lighting savings.

Thanks for the responses Anne and Bill.  But this seems ridiculous, and
goes against everything I've done to date.

 

So if we have an existing building with no windows, and we want to reuse
the building structure/skin (which LEED strongly encourages), we get
penalized for wanting some daylight in the building?  

 

I think all of the references to the "baseline building envelope shall
represent existing conditions" is intended to demonstrate that you can use
existing window and wall coefficients, NOT that you can't add windows.
But what do I know...

 

Does anyone know for sure?

I find existing envelopes always tricky because the information is not
delivered in the clearest manner.  However, I think in this case the
reviewer is correct, based on 90.1 Table G3.1.5 item f under "Baseline
Building Performance" and page G-17 of the User's Manual.  Also, in item c
they explicitly state that it applies to new buildings and additions, but
do not list existing (other than the little blip about alterations and
5.1.3.)

I know this has been covered before, but I just received the following
comment from a GBCI reviewer for a v3 Core and Shell project I'm working
on.  The project is basically an existing 5-story warehouse with almost no
windows.  Part of the renovation is adding windows.  The comment is as
follows:

 

Table 1.4.1B indicates that the window-to-gross-wall ratio is identical in
both cases; however it is unclear whether any fenestration was added or
removed as part of the renovation. The baseline ratio must reflect the
ratio as it existed prior to the renovation and the proposed ratio must
reflect the ratio as it exists after the renovation. Revise the Baseline
and/or Proposed cases as necessary so that the window-to-gross-wall ratio
is accurately modeled and provide a revised prerequisite form and updated
energy model output summaries as necessary. 

 

I didn't think that this was the case - I thought that if you had an
existing building, any EXISTING-TO-REMAIN windows would show up as the
existing window type, but any NEW windows in the proposed alteration would
be matched in the baseline model and comply with the Table 5.5
requirements.  Meaning the WWR remained the 1:1 as long as it was < 40%
glass.

 

I think this is just a matter of educating the reviewer on our building,
but I wanted to make sure that there hadn't been a shift in how GBCI
reviews existing buildings.

 

Thanks!

A basic principle of Appendix G is that fuel switching is not an energy
efficiency strategy, and shouldn't get rewarded. So the LEED interpretations
say that both baseline and proposed should use the same fuel with the same
rate structure, whether it is oil, gas, coal or biomass. However, depending
on the type and source of the biomass fuel, it may be considered "renewable"
for LEED. If it qualifies as a renewable energy source, the energy cost
becomes zero in the proposed case, and significant savings might be realized
under EAc1.    

Check the LEED reference guide for the types of biomass that qualify as
renewable. Generally speaking it has to be agricultural waste, and must be
locally sourced.

Hi everyone

During last week greenbuild at toronto i met a reviewer i and ask her what
kind of baseline system should i have when using biomass as heating fuel in
the proposed system.
She give me a different 'view': i should consider using biomass in both
buildings, so i could only take advantage of the energy efficiency of the
bioler (furnace) in the proposed, then i should consider the most used
system's efficiency  in the zone.
what do you think?, still confusing for me!

Use the ASHRAE Fundamentals book for internal load calculations for a large
list of average values of kitchen and office equipment.

Also the 90.1 User's manual has a table G-B in the back that has some
average densities that usually is a good start, but it is always different
for your specific building application and use.

Also, check out COMNET (http://www.comnet.org/mgp-manual).  The MGP manual contains a set of internal gain assumptions for each building type and space category.  The plug loads were derived from CBECS data.  It also contains lighting gain info from 90.1 and Title 24, schedule assumptions (also from ASHRAE and T24), plus occupancy assumptions, and gas process loads.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Benefits of energy modeling in early design
Message-ID: <CALX6ad_vwPOJvKe6NzDMzbBWXSTW4gG-mJgWMLsdASe=rZgDCw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I?ve found the attached figure showing ?potential impact/benefit? of
energy modeling and ?degree of effort?  along the different  stages of
design in various publications, an in none of them it was properly
explained.

Maybe someone can help me understand the following:


   1.          Why are there local maximums of ?impact/benefits? at the end
   of the ?Construction Documents? and ?Construction management? faze?
   2.          Why does degree of effort decreases during ?Construction
   documents? and ?construction management?
   3.          Units at vertical axis? What are they measuring?  ?Degree of
   effort?, meaning time and $$; ?potential impact/benefit?  meaning %of
   energy saving?

I?ve tracked down this figure to this two ASHRAE publication, still seems
not to be the ?developing? source.


ASHRAE Journal September 2004, ?Integrated design for sustainable buildings?


ASHRAE Green Guide, Second Edition. Page 73, chapter 5.:


?Figure 5-1 conceptually shows the impact of providing design input at
succeeding

stages of a project relative to the cost and effort required. The solid
curve shows

that it is much easier to have a major impact on the performance (potential
energy savings, water efficiency, maintenance costs, etc.) of a building if
you start at the very

earliest stages of the design process; the available impacts diminish
thereafter as you

proceed through the subsequent design and construction phases. A corollary
to this

is that the cost of implementing changes to improve building performance
rises at

each successive stage of the project (cost is shown as the dotted curve of
this graph).?


Thanks!


Regads,

Santiago.

Dear Mr. Teja,

As suggested by Dr. Dru Crawley, you may refer some tutorials for
energy simulation on website of IBPDA-India website.

Alternatively, you may consider attending the trainning program being
organsed by the Centre for IT in Building Science, IIIT Hyderabad
(India). It is a four day international training program on "Energy
simulation of buildings for LEED and ECBC' scheduled from December
19-22, 2011.

You may visit the website http://cbs.iiit.net to see further details.

Hope this would help you,

best regards,
Jyotirmay Mathur

I would actually like to model a low temperature Stirling engine in a small

The theoretical Stirling engine is reversible, so it's efficiency is the
same as a Carnot engine over the same temperature range.

If you want the efficiency of a real Stirling engine, then you would need to
know more details about the construction.

Two researchers who have looked at these engines in more detail are A. Organ
and T. Finkelstein.

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in 
a baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation, 
specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2 
requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions 
about the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same 
(as required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 
62.1 and the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received 
is below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv 
optionally the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy 
simulations for eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the 
standard responses to differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE 
Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across 
multiple LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand 
controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy 
simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the 
project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the 
values calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed 
case energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to 
providing only 30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate 
Procedure minimums, so higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they 
are modeled identically in both the Baseline and Proposed case energy 
models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems 
that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were 
modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not 
having Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm 
that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically 
in the Baseline and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. 
Additionally, please verify that all systems in both the baseline and 
proposed case are modeled with zero outside air flow when fans are 
cycled on to meet unoccupied setback temperatures unless health or 
safety regulations mandate an alternate minimum flow during unoccupied 
periods (in which case, the unoccupied outside air rates should be 
modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that 
have demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide 
control of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on 
occupancy sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must 
include the minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 
Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations for all systems having demand 
controlled ventilation.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems 
that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case. 
Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as 
approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED 
Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air 
ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE 
62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is 
taken for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for 
EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR.

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than 
the minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for 
credit IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the 
minimum required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air 
ventilation rate be the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 
calculations.

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor 
air, and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the 
Baseline outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy 
simulation?

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be 
the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does 
the user manual.

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning 
the additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to 
achieve IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed.

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is 
reflected in EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline 
efficiencies are the minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units.

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. 
Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to 
condition the outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on 
Proposed design to show energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 
90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the Baseline outdoor air be the minimum 
air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62 calculations? This puts the onus on the 
design team to provide a design that compensates for the increase in 
energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some method of processing the increase 
in outdoor air while still reducing energy consumption.

Dear Patrick,

 

Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while
I won't admit that I've been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to
change a couple of things J.

In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased
Ventilation credit was a clear case of "IEQ vs. energy"; you make a decision
to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and
then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with
each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused
by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science
which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that
required by ASHRAE 62.1!

The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can't find) anything in
621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that
is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1
include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)

All in all, I'm smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it's a good
day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

 

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a
baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation,
specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2
requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about
the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as
required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and
the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is
below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally
the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for
eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to
differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute. 

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE
Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple
LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand
controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy
simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the
project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values
calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case
energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only
30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so
higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in
both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having
Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum
outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please
verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled
with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have
demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control
of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy
sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the
minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate
Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.


The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case.
Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as
approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED
Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air
ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE
62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken
for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case
minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please
verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007)
minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control
ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please
confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify
that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with
zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback
temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate
minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied
outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed
case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question,
whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may
affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform
in relation to your Baseline case energy models. 

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1
energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide
further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that
outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed
cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the
energy recovery during mild conditions.

you're welcome james.  now if i could only get a straight answer on how 
to address baseline system sizing/outdoor air rates when the proposed 
building is evaporatively cooled with 100% outdoor air .... sizing a 
baseline building system of packaged dx just doesn't sit right when the 
proposed is providing 20,000 cfm with 100% outdoor air.  and i get mixed

Two quick thoughts:
1. Benefits of increased ventilation: There are actually several studies
that have concluded that increased ventilation rates provide benefits. Here
is  a link to two:  http://eetd.lbl.gov/news-archives/news-ventilation.html
2. While LEED 2009 and ASHRAE 90.1-2007 (Appendix G) require identical
ventilation rates, that will change with 90.-2010 and LEED 2012.  So in LEED
2012, if you take the increased ventilation path, you'll be required to
model the potential energy impact.

Dear Patrick,
 
Thank you for sharing this GBCI response!  It is very informative and, while
I won?t admit that I?ve been modeling anything incorrectly, I am going to
change a couple of things J.
In particular, I have heard on several occasions that the Increased
Ventilation credit was a clear case of ?IEQ vs. energy?; you make a decision
to trade one against the other.  After reading the GBCI response below and
then double-checking with ASHRAE 90.1, I find that they are consistent with
each other and effectively allow no penalty for the increased energy caused
by increased ventilation.  Very curious, considering there is no science
which demonstrates a health benefit for outdoor airflows greater than that
required by ASHRAE 62.1!
The other item is that I failed to notice (and still can?t find) anything in
621.1 which says that unoccupied ventilation should be zero.  I guess that
is OK, but is also curious, since a portion of the ventilation calcs in 62.1
include consideration for off-gassing materials (which are always present.)
All in all, I?m smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it?s a good
day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question
 
back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a
baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation,
specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2
requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about
the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as
required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and
the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is
below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally
the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for
eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to
differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute.

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE
Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple
LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand
controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy
simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the
project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values
calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case
energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only
30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so
higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in
both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having
Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum
outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please
verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled
with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have
demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control
of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy
sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the
minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate
Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case.
Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as
approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED
Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air
ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE
62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken
for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case
minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please
verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007)
minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control
ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please
confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify
that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with
zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback
temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate
minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied
outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed
case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question,
whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may
affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform
in relation to your Baseline case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1
energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide
further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that
outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed
cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the
energy recovery during mild conditions.

CUSTOMER EMAIL ADDRESS:

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for
EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR.

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the
minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit
IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum
required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be
the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations.

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air,
and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline
outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation?

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the
same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user
manual. 

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the
additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve
IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed.

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in
EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the
minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units.

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing
the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the
outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show
energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the
Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62
calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that
compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some
method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy
consumption.

Dear Patrick,

It sounds as though you are keeping the GBCI folk on their toes!  Keep it up
(assuming that your budget doesn't go down the tubes in the process.)

 

p.s., It's obvious to me that an all-evap system will beat DX into the
ground in an evap-friendly climate.  Your reviewer probably lives in Miami
;).  Also, If you are not already familiar with www.coolerado.com, check
them out.  They have a completely different heat exchanger design that
routinely gets ~95-100% wet bulb effectiveness.  (Disclaimer: I consult with
them and get paid for it.  I've also done hands-on testing at their factory
and at installations; they really get the performance they claim.)  
If an ASHRAE conference paper which discusses this would be helpful, look up
"Energy Simulation of Indirect Evaporative-Assisted-DX" from ASHRAE's Vegas
conference earlier this year.  If after looking at it, you think it actually
would be helpful, I mistakenly showed Denver's data for Phoenix and have
since corrected the paper..

you're welcome james.  now if i could only get a straight answer on how to
address baseline system sizing/outdoor air rates when the proposed building
is evaporatively cooled with 100% outdoor air .... sizing a baseline
building system of packaged dx just doesn't sit right when the proposed is
providing 20,000 cfm with 100% outdoor air.  and i get mixed comments from
reviewers about too much energy savings ... or providing too much outdoor
air in the baseline ...

All in all, I'm smarter than I was as a result of your post, so it's a good
day!  Thanks again.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] usgbc response to outdoor air question

 

back in september there was a thread about what the outdoor air rate in a
baseline simulation should be compared to a proposed simulation,
specifically when one is adding 30% more outdoor air to meet the ieqc2
requirement and earn 1 leed point.  there were differences of opinions about
the flow rates between baseline and proposed being either the same (as
required in 90.1 app g) or the baseline being the calculated per 62.1 and
the proposed being as designed.

so i submitted a support request to the usgbc and the reply i received is
below, but in short the response is that unless you're using dcv optionally
the outdoor air rates in the baseline and proposed energy simulations for
eac1 should be the same.  the response below gives the standard responses to
differing outdoor air rate scenarios.

regards,
patrick

Dear Patrick,

Thank you for contacting the Green Building Certification Institute. 

You ask very good questions related to the relationship between ASHRAE
Standards 62.1 and 90.1, and how these standards are applied across multiple
LEED Rating System prerequisites and credits.

The simple answer to your question is that, for systems without demand
controlled ventilation, the outdoor air included in EA Credit 1 energy
simulations must be the same in the Baseline and Proposed cases. If the
project is attempting IEQ Credit 2 Increased Ventilation, then the values
calculated in IEQc2 must be used in the EAc1 Basline and Proposed case
energy models. Note that IEQc2 does not limit the project to providing only
30% more outdoor air than AHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate Procedure minimums, so
higher amounts are acceptable, as long as they are modeled identically in
both the Baseline and Proposed case energy models.

The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do not have demand controlled ventilation:

It is unclear whether the minimum outside air rates (in CFM) were modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed case for all zones not having
Demand Control Ventilation in the Proposed case. Please confirm that minimum
outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed cases using the proposed case rates. Additionally, please
verify that all systems in both the baseline and proposed case are modeled
with zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed case).

The situation becomes a bit more complicated in you have systems that have
demand controlled ventilation (often implemented as Carbon Dioxide control
of outdoor air or as programmed control of outdoor air based on occupancy
sensors.) In this case the Baseline case energy model must include the
minimum outdoor air as determined by the ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Rate
Procedure calculations for all systems having demand controlled ventilation.


The following generic LEED Review Comment applies to ventilation systems
that do have demand controlled ventilation:

Demand control ventilation was modeled for credit in the proposed case.
Appendix G allows schedule changes for demand control ventilation as
approved by the rating authority (Table G3.1#4(Baseline)). As the LEED
Certification rating authority, GBCI requires that the outside air
ventilation rates for the Baseline case be modeled using minimum ASHRAE
62.1-2004 (or 2007 for LEED-NC 2009 projects) rates wherever credit is taken
for demand control ventilation in the Proposed case. The proposed case
minimum rates at design conditions should be modeled as designed. Please
verify that the Baseline Case model reflects ASHRAE 62.1-2004 (or 2007)
minimum rates for any spaces where credit is taken for demand control
ventilation, or revise the model accordingly. For all other spaces, please
confirm that minimum outside airflow (in units of cfm) was modeled
identically in the Baseline and Proposed cases. Additionally, please verify
that all systems in both the baseline and proposed cases are modeled with
zero outside air flow when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied setback
temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an alternate
minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the unoccupied
outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline and Proposed
case).

Finally, even though you don't address energy recovery in your question,
whether or not you have energy recovery in your ventilation systems may
affect how much better (or worse) your Proposed case energy models perform
in relation to your Baseline case energy models. 

The following generic LEED Review Comment addresses energy recovery in EAc1
energy models as it relates to ventilation systems.

Energy recovery is modeled for credit in the Proposed case. Please provide
further information regarding the energy recovery efficiency, verify that
outside air is modeled with zero flow in both the Baseline and Proposed
cases during unoccupied periods when fans are cycled on to meet unoccupied
setback temperatures unless health or safety regulations mandate an
alternate minimum flow during unoccupied periods (in which case, the
unoccupied outside air rates should be modeled identically in the Baseline
and Proposed Case), and indicate the bypass mechanism used to bypass the
energy recovery during mild conditions.

CUSTOMER INQUIRY:
I am trying to verify what the minimum outdoor airflow rate required for
EAc1 is and am not sure if this requires a CIR. 

If the Proposed outdoor air ventilation is a minimum of 30% higher than the
minimum required by ASHRAE 62 in order to achieve 1 LEED point for credit
IEQC2 is the Baseline outdoor air rate also 30% higher than the minimum
required by ASHRAE 62? or would the Baseline outdoor air ventilation rate be
the minimum outdoor air rate per ASHRAE 62 calculations. 

In other words, if ASHRAE 62 requires a minimum of 1,000 CFM of outdoor air,
and 1,300 CFM is provided to attain 1 LEED point via IEQC1, is the Baseline
outdoor air flow rate 1,000 CFM or 1,300 CFM in the energy simulation? 

90.1-2007/2004 both say the minimu    m outdoor airflow rates shall be the
same for both the proposed and baseline building designs, as does the user
manual. 

But this logic seems to reward the Proposed simulation by conditioning the
additional outdoor air supplied (300 cfm in the example above) to achieve
IEQC1 in the Baseline system as well as the proposed. 

The logic of using the minimum required in the Baseline case is reflected in
EAC1 in the equipment efficiency requirements. Baseline efficiencies are the
minimum required, e.g. SEER 13 for packaged units. 

It is the intent of the requirement that I am not sure is clear. Increasing
the outdoor air ventilation rate increases the energy used to condition the
outdoor air, so if the intent is to put the onus on Proposed design to show
energy reduction/LEED compliance over the 90.1/62 requirements shouldn't the
Baseline outdoor air be the minimum air flow rate per the ASHRAE 62
calculations? This puts the onus on the design team to provide a design that
compensates for the increase in energy to meet IEQC2 by providing some
method of processing the increase in outdoor air while still reducing energy
consumption.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Severe errors for Fan Power modelling of VAV system in
	Energyplus
Message-ID: <CAAuCZb9a6KJye0Wbb8fg1T=W0BidbvMd30xj=QSfce+om0w4xg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all:****

 ****

In a baseline building modeling for LEED EApr2 documentation, I have some
troubles with the simulation reports that shows  unusually high amounts of
severe errors (over 1000);  when I try to model System Fan Power according
G3.1.2.9. and procedure proposed by James V Dirkes II, PE in a previous post
(pro-rating fan power to supply/ret?urn fans per 90.1-2007?).****



I am concerned if we can be observed by LEED reviewer team about this severe
warnings.****



Simulation details:****



-Baseline model consist of six-levels building for typical office usage
(8000m2 area approx.)

-HVAC system type 8, VAV with PFP zones according ASHRAE 90.1-2007 appendix
G.****

-Energyplus 6.0.0.023 software has been used.****

-HVAC systems has been modeled with HVAC templates in this configuration:***
*

              -Chilled Water loop with HVACTemplate:Plant:ChilledWaterLoop,
Chiller and Cooling Tower****

              -System-side equipment with HVACTemplate:System:VAV****

              -Zone-side equipment with HVACTemplate:Zone:VAV:FanPowered****

 ****

-System Fan Power modeling details:****

              -Supply Fan Total Efficiency = 0.6 ****

              -Supply Fan Delta Pressure = 1495 Pa****

              -Supply Fan Motor Efficiency = 0.9****

 ****

 ****

-Severe errors details:****

              -When Supply Fan Delta Pressure exceeds 500Pa,
simulation error log exposes unusually high amounts of recurrent severe
errors like that (over 1000 severe errors):

****

   ** Severe  ** FindRootSimpleController: Controller error for controller =
SYSTEMVAV_DATACENTER COOLING COIL CONTROLLER
   **   ~~~   **  Environment=SANTIAGO, at Simulation time=01/01 04:30 -
04:35
   **   ~~~   **   Controller function is inconsistent with user specified
controller action = Reverse action
   **   ~~~   **   Actuator will be set to maximum action
   **   ~~~   ** Controller control type=Temperature
   **   ~~~   ** Controller temperature set point = 11.41 [C]
   **   ~~~   ** Controller sensed temperature = 12.17 [C]
   **   ~~~   ** Controller actuator mass flow rate set to 0.70 [kg/s]
   **   ~~~   ** Controller actuator temperature = 12.20 [C]
   **   ~~~   **   Note: Chilled water coils should be reverse action and
the entering chilled
   **   ~~~   **         water temperature (controller actuator temperature)
should be below the setpoint temperature
   **   ~~~   **   Note: Hot water coils should be normal action and the
entering hot
   **   ~~~   **         water temperature (controller actuator temperature)
should be above the setpoint temperature****

              -Also I tried to reduce Supply Fan Total Efficiency and
maintain Supply Fan Delta Pressure less than 500Pa but severe errors also
occurred.****


Suggestions to reduce this errors or modeling system fan power in a
different way?  ****

Any comments will be appreciated....****

Regards

Chances are they don't have a "straight answer" to give you. I would 
recommend modeling it the way that feels right to you, using your 
knowledge of how the building works and your expertise as a modeler, and 
providing documentation for the choices you made and why you believe 
they are correct. If your arguments hold together you might not have any 
trouble at all.

Message-ID: <CAJaiD7orVkyOAyCaH2TuJ0Q0GJRP0Z4nm9MefyDKF4DdPmYftA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm sure the energy reduction is a function of various situation specific
factors but are there any studies, published or otherwise, documenting
projected or achieved savings from VRF systems compared to a baseline of a
split system without the variable flow or ASHRAE 90.1 baseline systems?

I'm looking for thumbrule assumptions that can be applied at the schematic
design level without having to go through the complicated workarounds.

Thank you,
Ramana Koti.

There is an EnergyPro Users group:
see the following website:
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EnergyPro/

Between the group and support at EnergySoft, I think you'll be able to get
most of your questions answered.

Dear all,

ASHRAE 90.1 appendix G G.3.1.10 defines the base building pump power. I have basic questions regarding this:

1)??? Is 22w/gpm for both primary and secondary pumps put together??

2)??? The user manual defines 22w/gpm as pump operating against a 75 foot head with 60% combined impellar and motor efficiency.
I work on Visual Doe. I have to input impellar efficiency and motor efficiency separately. How do i input these values?

3)??? If 22w/gpm is including secondary pump, then what will be the head and efficiencies for primary pump and secondary pump?

4)??? The condenser water pump power is 19 w/gpm. What is the head, impellar efficiency and motor efficiency?

Looking forward for your replies.

Rathnashree,

 

1)      The ASHRAE baseline pump power requirement has been discussed in
the equest-users forum. There was not a consensus, but the votes were
leaning toward splitting the 22W/gpm between the primary and secondary
pumps, and not assigning 22W/gpm to each pump. See the archives here: 
http://lists.onebuilding.org/htdig.cgi/equest-users-onebuilding.org/2010
-November/006942.html and here: 
http://lists.onebuilding.org/htdig.cgi/equest-users-onebuilding.org/2010
-December/007044.html

2)      I believe the inputs for the chilled water pump power would be
"CCIRC-HEAD = 75", "CCIRC-IMPELLER-EFF = 0.65" and "CCIRC-MOTOR-EFF =
1.0".

3)      Again, per the archive threads I provided, there was no
consensus. You need to make a judgment call on how to split the power
up.

4)      I believe the inputs for CW pump power would be "TWR-PUMP-HEAD =
60.0", "TWR-IMPELLER-EFF = 0.60" and "TWR-MOTOR-EFF = 1.0".

 

Regards,

Bill

Alvaro,

I can only speak to the EnergyPlus side of things (not LEED).  You will have to look into the created .idf and analyze the individual cases through customized outputs to verify the system is working as you desire.

From the one error you listed in your post, the data center cooling coil is working to heat the air stream on January 1st at 4 in the morning.  The air entering the coil is 54F (12.17C) and the setpoint is 52.5F (11.41C).  The temperature of the water entering the coil is 54F.  The problem here is that 54F water can?t cool the air to 52.5F, but since ?cooling? is required, E+ doesn?t know how to react.  With the reported chilled water temperature, the chiller is likely not on.  (I?ve seen that error a time or two, and generally the chiller wasn?t on and there was no flow in the chilled water loop, so the model was not particularly compromised.)  You?ll want to verify how the system is reacting at that timestep and the one after to make sure there isn?t a deeper issue.

I don?t think the supply fan pressure would be directly causing the issue, possibly just adding enough heat to require cooling at more timesteps.  I would check how the Setpoint Managers were set up in the .idf input file, which may likely be the root cause.

I suggest using the Output:Variable objects to verify accurate system performance at the timesteps in question, such as the ones listed below.  You may also want to output some air temperatures across the air handling unit and their corresponding setpoints.

Output:Variable,
    *,                       !- Key Value
    Chiller Evap Water Outlet Temp ,  !- Variable Name

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Severe errors for Fan Power modelling of VAV system in Energyplus

Dear all:

In a baseline building modeling for LEED EApr2 documentation, I have some troubles with the simulation reports that shows  unusually high amounts of severe errors (over 1000);  when I try to model System Fan Power according G3.1.2.9. and procedure proposed by James V Dirkes II, PE in a previous post (pro-rating fan power to supply/ret?urn fans per 90.1-2007?).

I am concerned if we can be observed by LEED reviewer team about this severe warnings.

Simulation details:

-Baseline model consist of six-levels building for typical office usage (8000m2 area approx.)
-HVAC system type 8, VAV with PFP zones according ASHRAE 90.1-2007 appendix G.
-Energyplus 6.0.0.023 software has been used.
-HVAC systems has been modeled with HVAC templates in this configuration:
              -Chilled Water loop with HVACTemplate:Plant:ChilledWaterLoop, Chiller and Cooling Tower
              -System-side equipment with HVACTemplate:System:VAV
              -Zone-side equipment with HVACTemplate:Zone:VAV:FanPowered

-System Fan Power modeling details:
              -Supply Fan Total Efficiency = 0.6
              -Supply Fan Delta Pressure = 1495 Pa
              -Supply Fan Motor Efficiency = 0.9


-Severe errors details:
              -When Supply Fan Delta Pressure exceeds 500Pa, simulation error log exposes unusually high amounts of recurrent severe errors like that (over 1000 severe errors):

   ** Severe  ** FindRootSimpleController: Controller error for controller = SYSTEMVAV_DATACENTER COOLING COIL CONTROLLER
   **   ~~~   **  Environment=SANTIAGO, at Simulation time=01/01 04:30 - 04:35
   **   ~~~   **   Controller function is inconsistent with user specified controller action = Reverse action
   **   ~~~   **   Actuator will be set to maximum action
   **   ~~~   ** Controller control type=Temperature
   **   ~~~   ** Controller temperature set point = 11.41 [C]
   **   ~~~   ** Controller sensed temperature = 12.17 [C]
   **   ~~~   ** Controller actuator mass flow rate set to 0.70 [kg/s]
   **   ~~~   ** Controller actuator temperature = 12.20 [C]
   **   ~~~   **   Note: Chilled water coils should be reverse action and the entering chilled
   **   ~~~   **         water temperature (controller actuator temperature) should be below the setpoint temperature
   **   ~~~   **   Note: Hot water coils should be normal action and the entering hot
   **   ~~~   **         water temperature (controller actuator temperature) should be above the setpoint temperature
              -Also I tried to reduce Supply Fan Total Efficiency and maintain Supply Fan Delta Pressure less than 500Pa but severe errors also occurred.

Suggestions to reduce this errors or modeling system fan power in a different way?
Any comments will be appreciated....

Hi Rathna,

Pay attention to the total Baseline chiller capacity as well.

1.) Baseline chillers <=300 tons: The chilled water loop is modeled with
constant primary/variable secondary flow with the secondary pump riding the
curve.  Primary chilled water loop (1 constant speed pump) + the secondary
chilled water loop (1 constant speed pump) +  the condenser water loop (1
constant speed pump);

2.) Baseline chillers >300 & < 600 tons: The chilled water loop is modeled
with constant primary / variable secondary flow.  Primary chilled water loop
(2 constant speed pump interlocked with associated chillers) + the secondary
chilled water loop (1 variable speed pump) + the condenser water loop (2
constant speed pump interlocked with associated chillers);

3.)  Baseline chillers >= 600 tons: The chilled water loop is modeled with
constant primary / variable secondary flow. Primary chilled water loop (2
constant speed pump interlocked with associated chillers) + the secondary
chilled water loop (1 variable speed pump) + the condenser water loop (2
constant speed pump interlocked with associated chillers);

My  understanding is, as long as 22W/gpm and 19W/gpm can be applied to all
baseline water pumps, you can allocate pump energy to each pump based on
your common sense (e.g. 6w/gpm for primary and 16w/gpm for secondary).  From
there, you should be able to adjust pump configuration to fulfil its
allocated energy.

Regards,

Cheney

Hi everyone,

 

Simple question I hope.  How do we create a ERV with a 4-pipe fan coil
system in eQUEST.  For an unknown reason, eQUEST doesn?t allow us to put
heat recovery device with Fan coil systems.  Do we have to create a zone and
another system with a ERV that will provide air to the fan coils.

 

Thanks in advance for any clue.

Message-ID: <003c01cc8e6d$45692580$d03b7080$@sudassociates.com>

I expected to see more on this in the archives.

 

Is there a consensus on the acceptable floor area to include in a LEED
model?  I'll talk as though the building is one story for simplicity.  It
seems that floor area is supposed to be consistent across credits, which
leads me toward making the sum of the rooms in the model equal the total
foot print, including all interior  and exterior walls, as well as
mechanical chases.  However, it seems like a lot of modelers like to just
use the interior floor area of each room, which will obviously total to less
than the total footprint area.  

 

For correct modeling, I can see it both ways.  For instance, all of the area
of the exterior surfaces should be accounted for (entire footprint), but
ventilation (in cfm/sf) should just be accounting for usable floor area (sum
of interior room areas).  How do others approach this, and what experience
have you had with LEED reviewers?   

 

Thanks,

Christian

I am so sorry to lose Lynn as a mentor, inspiration and friend, and she 
was all those things. Always approachable, she never made you feel like 
you were wasting her time. I remember a few phone calls to her when she 
was probably hugely busy but took the time to answer my questions. The 
last question I asked her that day was "Gosh Lynn, you have so many 
letters after your name - PE, BEMP. etc., how does that make you feel?". 
I was thinking she'd say proud but she laughed a bit and said, "kinda 
foolish, actually."

For me, having worked in this industry longer than I'm going to admit, 
it was really, really exciting to finally have a woman president of 
ASHRAE. I remember going to meetings when I first joined that maybe had 
a dozen women at them. It was especially nice that she was so competent 
and forward thinking, too. I will miss her!

I am going to send this to a couple of other mailings lists and if 
others want to share their memories of Lynn with us, as well as the 
family, I would love to read them. If not that's okay, too.

Sincerely,

If you have the time for a 4.2 MB download from the IBPSA web site, read the 
6-page long interview that Veronica Soebarto (the IBPSA News Editor) had 
with Lynn Bellenger.  It's in the November 2010 issue of the News and 
reveals the willingness of Lynn to share her experiences and insights with 
others.

This issue is located at: http://www.ibpsa.org/Newsletter/IBPSANews-20-2.pdf

So sad to see her depart!

Lynn was my mentor and it was a privilege to work for her and learn from
her. Powerful and assertive, yet humble and kind, she was a strong
advocate for the role that energy modeling can play in sustainable
building design. Becoming ASHRAE President was a tremendous source of
pride for her. Her presidential theme was "Modeling a Sustainable
World".

 

"We are Building on the Shoulders of Giants. Today, we are called to
become the giants of our industry, to set the example of innovation and
dedication that future generations will remember when they look back on
the time when buildings ceased being net consumers of energy and became
net zero energy, and even producers of energy. 

 

People need heroes; we admire excellence; we respect courage; we long
for the expression of these qualities in our own lives and we cherish
them wherever we find them. Today, this month, this year, I'm calling on
you to be the heroes. To set the example in energy efficiency, in
elegant, innovative solutions to meeting the energy needs of today and
the future. To model a sustainable world."

 

I will miss Lynn.

 

Respectfully,

Bill

Std 90.1 defines the gross floor area to include exterior and interior
walls.  A LEED consultant I work with sent the following from the latest
LEED 2009 addendum:

"Gross floor area (based on ASHRAE definition) is that sum of the floor
areas of the spaces within the building, including basements, mezzanine and
intermediate-floored tiers, and penthouses with headroom height of 7.5 ft
(2.2 meters) or greater. Measurements must be taken from the exterior faces
of exterior walls OR from the centerline of walls separating buildings, OR
(for LEED CI certifying spaces) from the centerline of walls separating
spaces. Excludes non-enclosed (or non-enclosable) roofed-over areas such as
exterior covered walkways, porches, terraces or steps, roof overhand, and
similar features. Excludes air shafts, pipe trenches, and chimneys. Excludes
floor area dedicated to the parking and circulation of motor vehicles. (Note
that while excluded features may not be part of the gross floor area, and
therefore technically not a part of the LEED project building, they may
still be required to be a part of the overall LEED project and subject to
MPRs, prerequisites, and credits)."

 

Note that your lighting allowance is based on the gross floor area.

 

As for OA, Std 62 defines the zone area as net occupiable, so inside face to
inside face and excludes permanent obstructions such as columns.

 

Regarding other credits, apparently there is a rule of thumb that the gross
area in EAp2 should be within 7% of the reported gross area used for the
PIFs.

 

I just went through all this for a LEED project.  It's in design review
right now, but this is what they asked for.

Dear Forum,
Assuming:

.        10 story hotel with 200 guest rooms facing all compass directions 

.        Each guest room has HVAC and outdoor air from a through-the-wall
heat pump

How can I create a simple modeling scheme and schedules which will reflect
normal occupancy variations?

As I think about it, the reality of operation is quite different than a
central HVAC unit, because random individual rooms can be completely off,
while others are on.  Room temperature, ventilation and fan power are all
affected.  There will be no predictable pattern for which rooms are unused
or unoccupied.  ASHRAE does have some typical use patterns in their 90.1
User Manual but, for example, they assume 100% on time for fans.  That's too
coarse for my taste, and will overestimate energy substantially.

I REALLY don't want to model 200 individual zones with varying schedules!  I
know that I'm not the first one to wrestle with this idea, so I am hoping
for some creative insight from you.

Thanks in advance!

Good luck.

This is a common problem, typically nothing is typical.  It is all up to
judgment.

The "typical patter" is hard to define.  My parents are part owners of the
hotel in a small town.  Typically it is empty but it fills up during
holidays, the busiest holiday is Opening Day of Hunting Season.  I'm sure
Vegas has a different "typical patter" as does the KC air port hotel, ect.  

If I was modeling 200 guest rooms and wanted different schedules I would make
5 schedules. A, B, C, D and E, then assign them to the various guest rooms.
To create the schedules I would suggest talking to the owner, use judgment,
and keep in mind the goal/purpose of the model. [And see what give you the
most point. :-P]

This is just a discussion point but 'Guest rooms' are either occupied or not.
>From what I understand, if you have 10 offices each with 1 person and the
occupancy schedule says 25%, it means that there is 1/4 of a person is in
each office (Happy Halloween!).  But offices are usually on a common system.
Each guest room will be independent, so I would assume the guest room
schedules will either be 100% or 0%.

know that I'm not the first one to wrestle with this idea, so I am hoping for

I quickly go through 90.1 UM and notice:

1. As per Appendix G, UM highlights that "these values may be used only if
actual schedule are not know";
2. As per schedule for occupancy -hotel/motel, the percent varies from 90%
(night) to 20% (noon). It is quite reasonable to me provided no actual
schedule are known. I guess you can further reduce it proportionally if you
are able to get more info, such as optimal  occupancy rate for the hotel.
3. There is no schedule for fan running 100% but HVAC system. You can
understand it as running 100% on time for HVAC system with occupancy sensors
since you have PTHP providing both conditioning and OA in individual rooms.
Fan power will be calculated with respect to occupancy schedule in this
manner.
4. Bear in mind, your baseline will be PTAC or PTHP for hotel. You
will probably overestimate fan energy savings if you are to use the
by-default schedule (and you believe the real occupancy rate will be
differnt).
5. To me, such schedule is more important and sensitive for M&V modeling. I
will not bother about using by-default occupancy schedule for LEED/incentive
modeling.

Dear Forum,

Hi James,

You did not say which model you are using so I'll put this in eQUEST 
terms. Hotels, motels, and high rise residential buildings will have 
very different schedules than offices, etc., because the assumption is 
that people are coming and going at different times. If you specify any 
one of those building types eQUEST will give you a schedule which is 
likely perfectly good for you to use for occupancy, lighting, equipment, 
etc. You can at least call it up and then modify it as you see fit, if 
you see fit.

With regard to the 100% on time for fans, if you read the help behind 
this schedule you will probably find that it is an availability 
schedule, not an actual use schedule.

Lastly, just do your best with the schedules, etc., and simplify the 
model for yourself as much as you can. If you read in Appendix G about 
thermal blocks, this is just the kind of building to look for them in.

Best,

Carol

It has been clearly stated in EE4 modelling guide. Basically, Air source
heat pump should be modeled as system rather than plants.

LEED energy modeling with eQUEST (November 3, 2011)
Presented by Amanda Bogner, PE, LEED AP, President, The Energy Studio, Inc.
http://www.ecw.org/university/ecuevent.php?ecuid=409
More and more building owners and developers are demanding LEED certification for their projects. To meet these stringent requirements, engineers need the skills to develop and document energy models that align with ASHRAE 90.1-2007, Appendix G, the energy efficiency standard that LEED certification requires. This course presents an in-depth overview of ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Appendix G and demonstrates how to develop baseline and proposed case models using the eQUEST energy analysis software. Common LEED documentation pitfalls will be discussed, along with tips on how to submit a successful energy model for LEED review.

COST
The registration fee for attending Introductory and intermediate eQUEST is $549, which includes continental breakfast, refreshments, and lunch each day. Attend all three days of eQUEST training for the discounted rate of $799.

Hi everyone,

 

We are currently using Comfen 4.0 in one of our project.  Is there a way to
import Comfen4.0 datas from one computer to another.  In our case we
elaborated approximately 50 scenarios and we need to import those scenarios
on another computer.

The central plant with air source heat pump and possibly boiler 
backup (gas/electric) can be modelled using EE4.  The EE4 Version 
1.70 Modelling Guide provides guidance in Section 4.6.4.  The 
modelling guide can be downloaded from 
http://canmetenergy-canmetenergie.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/eng/software_tools/ee4/modelling_guide.html

Use the seasonal efficiency of the air source heat pump.  The "ground 
source" is the heat exchanger. In your case the heat exchanger is the 
air.  You could be modelling a sea-water source heat-pump with backup 
boiler.

The only caveat is that you cannot model a water-source heat pump 
HVAC system if you use the Combination Ground Source Heat Pump plant.

The scenarios are stored in the COMFEN database, which is called
comfen.sqlite. If you copy that database onto another computer, you can open
it with COMFEN. You might want to rename it from the default name so that
you don?t overwrite the default database on the computer you are copying it
to. You can change databases from the COMFEN menu, Preferences choice,
Database tab. 

 

Let me know if you need more details about how to do this.

Hi everyone,

 

We are currently using Comfen 4.0 in one of our project.  Is there a way to
import Comfen4.0 datas from one computer to another.  In our case we
elaborated approximately 50 scenarios and we need to import those scenarios

CAP_FT=a2 + b2 X t evap +c2 X t evap ^2 + d2 X tcond + e2 X tcond^2 + f2 X t evap X tcond 
EIR_FT =  a3 + b3 X t evap +c3 X t evap ^2 + d3 X tcond + e3 X tcond^2 + f3 X t evap X tcond
 
So I created these three performance curve using Bi-Quadratic curve type with Leaving Evaporator, Entering Condensor Temp , capacity , load and EIR as needed in the aboved equation.
 
I'm not sure whether it is correct, could you give me some suggestions?

You can look at the EnergyPlus example file called 5ZoneVAV-Pri-SecLoop.idf as a guide for creating a primary-secondary chilled water flow configuration in EnergyPlus.

Basically, you just have to have two pumps in the chilled water plant loop: a Pump:VariableSpeed object to represent the secondary loop and a Pump:ConstantSpeed object to represent the primary loop.  And then in the chilled water PlantLoop object, change the Common Pipe Simulation parameter from blank to ?TwoWayCommonPipe?

You may want to run the example file and look at the .svg output file to see how the plant is arranged and how the node names should match between the various EnergyPlus objects.

Use the EngineeringReference document (from the help menu) and search the document for Primary-Secondary to find the section that explains how primary-secondary loops are implemented and controlled in EnergyPlus.

Taylor Engineering has a great reference article on how to regress chiller performance curves.

http://www.taylor-engineering.com/downloads/articles/ASHRAE%20Symposium%20AC-02-9-1%20Electric%20Chiller%20Model-Hydeman.pdf

For EnergyPlus, make sure you are using SI units (degrees C) for the temperatures or the curves will not have the correct coefficients.

In order to regress the two biquadratic curves you will need more than one full load performance point (at different, variable leaving water and entering condenser water/ambient temperatures).

You can create a macro or use the Data Analysis Add-In Regression function in Excel to perform the actual curve regressions from a compiled number of data points.

EnergyPlus also comes with a database of chiller performance including all three chiller performance curves for various manufacturers which you may find useful.  (Typical location is C:\EnergyPlusV6-0-0\DataSets\Chillers.idf)

Dear Malherek,


Thank you for your advice! It really helped me!
But I still have some questions.
When I use the common pile in the "Plant Loop", the simulation could run. But when I tried to use the "Two-way common pile" as you indicated, errors occur as follows.


   ** Severe  ** While using a two way common pipe there must be a set point in addition to the Plant Supply Outlet node.
   **   ~~~   ** Currently neither plant demand inlet nor plant supply inlet have setpoints.
   **   ~~~   ** Select one of the two nodes and rerun the simulation.
   **   ~~~   ** Occurs for:  PlantLoop=CHW LOOP


Can you please give me a hint?


Thanks!

That warning is stating that you don?t have any control scheme set up to manage the water temperature in the chilled water loop.

You?ll have to use a SetpointManager:Scheduled (or some other setpoint manager if you don?t have a single setpoint control).  You?ll need to reference which node you are referring to, but it should be either Plant Side Outlet Node (which sets the temperature of the mixed water leaving the chillers and chiller bypass) or the Demand Side Inlet (which sets the temperature of the water entering the coils).  I usually do the Plant Side Outlet Node.  You can check what the name of that node is in the PlantLoop object for the chilled water system; it will be the node name for the Plant Side Outlet Node Name parameter.  (In that example file I referenced, the setpoint node was Chilled Water Loop ChW Pri Supply Outlet)

In the SetpointManager:Scheduled object you will need to reference a schedule.  If you have a fixed temperature setpoint, the easiest schedule to use is the Schedule:Constant.  Remember that the value should be in degrees Celsius.

Hopefully that helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Baseline System type exceptions
Message-ID: <CALWh9hhLYDo6=nY7eEziNB86RNvV6LA0AWHGvDPYHZg5PmHTkQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have an office building that I'm trying to model per ASHRAE 90.1-2007
appendix G, with 5 core zones and 5 perimeter zones for a total of 10 zones
(it has way more than 10 zones but to make it simpler we'll say 10). Because
the office building is heated with natural gas and is more than 5 stories it
is Baseline system 7. This office building has a lot of glass that isn't the
best performance glazing. Therefore the load on the 5 perimeter zones is 50
btu/h-sqft and the load on the 5 core zones is 10 btu/h-sqft, for an average
of 30 btu/h-sqft. ASHRAE 90.1-2007 G3.1.1 exception b states that:

"If the baseline HVAC system type is 5, 6, 7, or 8, use separate single-zone
systems conforming with the requirements of System 3 or System 4 (depending
on building heating source) for any spaces that have occupancy or process
loads or schedules that differ significantly from the rest of the building.
*Peak thermal loads that differ by 10 Btu/h-ft2 or more from the average of
other spaces served by the system* or schedules that differ by more than 40
equivalent full-load hours per week from other spaces served by the system
are considered to differ significantly."

Since all my spaces vary by 10 btu/h-sqft for the average (30 btu/h-sqft)
I'm curious what to do. I can see a few options so far, but I want to know
what your experience has been.

   - Put all the zones in the building on system 3, because they all vary by
   10 btu/h-sqft from the average.
   - Put all the perimeter zones on system 3, making the core zones fall
   within a 10 btu/h-sqft average.
   - Put all the core zones on system 3, making the perimeter zones fall
   within a 10 btu/h-sqft average.
   - Put a few of either the core or perimeter zones on system 3 until the
   average of the others falls within range, but how do I pick which zones?

Any ideas?

If the only distinguishing feature driving the load is envelope, and the zones are on the same system in the design, I think I would keep them all on System 7 in the baseline.

I tend to use G3.1.1 exception b only when there is a good argument for why the building would be designed that way.
Very unlikely that a 7-story office building would use single zone air-cooled systems for either core or interior zones on each floor.

For additional certainty on the approach you could try an administrative request to USGBC or informal interpretation request to ASHRAE 90.1 committee.

Hi,

*1. I doubt you can understand exception b in this manner. My understanding
is that this exception should only be applied to individual rooms which may
need individual HVAC system due to its 'abnormal' thermal loads or schedules
other than the space at the same floor, for example, server rooms, telecom
rooms, small laboratory spaces, auditoriums and security rooms among office
spaces.*
*2. Probably you should further clarify how you can get 50 btu/h-sqft for
perimeter zones and 10 btu/h-sqft for inner zones. Is this 10 btu/h-sqft
heating peak load for inner zones?*

Regards,

Cheney

Added consideration will be given for additional credentials beyond the professional degree (e.g., Ph.D.). Primary duties will include teaching at the graduate level within the Master of Science in Sustainable Design program. The position may involve participation in design studios, lectures, advanced seminars, the supervision of thesis students, and student advising. Research/creative activities and school/university/community service are also required, as per faculty handbook expectations. Research may be creative, professional, or theoretical. External grants, commissions, competitions, committee duties, and service to the community, University and the school are important.

I will just add that our location in the nation's capital offers unparalleled opportunities for collaboration and course development with national institutions that have already allowed us to implement an innovative curriculum.

Thank you for your attention.

Message-ID: <CADgO5yL6dphFvg4aJmX4es3FbO-DsLNkmgYExDtmtdUejNGB3Q@mail.gmail.com>

In the situation that a design is utilizing an efficient exhaust/make up air
system, the LEED book says that an exceptional calculation may be used to
help quantify savings.  This leads me to believe that the kitchen cooking
equipment is process, but the HVAC equipment is not.  My office has been
having a "discussion" about whether HVAC equipment that conditions air for
process equipment is considered process as well.

Another example that is plaguing me:  an electrical rack room has 90 kW of
stuff and requires 25 tons of cooling.  If i use an efficient design, can i
take credit for it by comparing my design to a baseline of system 3 (PTAC w/
DX cooling and furnace heating)?  I believe that this HVAC system should be
allowed to get credit, but others argue that because it serves process
equipment, then it is "process" heating/cooling.

Any thoughts from LEED AP out there? (i'm still working on getting my LEED
AP).

Thanks,

In my opinion...

Your HVAC system for the makeup air or servers / racks is HVAC for a room in
a building which (at least occasionally) has people in it.  I think it
qualifies as non-process.

My understanding is that your HVAC system is not process. Even in the old
LEED system where process energy/plug energy will be removed from final
energy cost savings, will still consider the heating and cooling energy
iccured by such process/plug loads.

HVAC energy consumption caused by process loads cannot be called process loads. Nor would you want it to be a process load, because then you can't take credit for savings or at least not as easily.

Correct, your electrical or IT room with 90kW baseline is a system 3, and your Proposed can be an efficient design. ASHRAE 90.1-2007 G3.1.1 exception b allows you to apply system 3 for zones with large process loads.

This can be a huge source of energy savings. Enjoy it now, because rumor has it that the next version of 90.1 will set an alternate baseline for IT rooms and the like, and system 3 will no longer be applicable because the energy savings can be ridiculously large.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Kitchen/Laundry HVAC Systems

In the situation that a design is utilizing an efficient exhaust/make up air system, the LEED book says that an exceptional calculation may be used to help quantify savings.  This leads me to believe that the kitchen cooking equipment is process, but the HVAC equipment is not.  My office has been having a "discussion" about whether HVAC equipment that conditions air for process equipment is considered process as well.

Another example that is plaguing me:  an electrical rack room has 90 kW of stuff and requires 25 tons of cooling.  If i use an efficient design, can i take credit for it by comparing my design to a baseline of system 3 (PTAC w/ DX cooling and furnace heating)?  I believe that this HVAC system should be allowed to get credit, but others argue that because it serves process equipment, then it is "process" heating/cooling.

Any thoughts from LEED AP out there? (i'm still working on getting my LEED AP).

Thanks,

I completely agree with you Fred.  This is the same logic that i followed.
 Unfortunately my superiors do not agree with this logic, even though I have
shown them the same exception that you mention.  Their logic states that
process loads shall be the same in both models, and anything associated with
process loads (such as cooling for a data room or exhaust/make up air for a
kitchen) do not serve any purpose except for process and therefore is also
process.

Does anyone have anything from USGBC clarifying this issue?  I have looked
through the interpretations and nothing speaks to the HVAC equipment of
process loads.

Thanks for the input so far,

Rob

Hey folks:

The idea of five schedules or so sure seems to make sense to my feeble mind.
Ask the owner for their, or the hotel management company's occupation
projection and expected event projection and then match that up as well as
you can and have at it.

It varies widely whether or not individual rooms are turned off when
unoccupied based upon many things including but not limited to local weather
(can vary at different year parts whether or not they are turned off between
occupants), local customs, hotel brand/price point, room location in the
structure (low/high, inside/outside and so on), and, none of this deals with
the reality of what type of guest at different week and year parts (business
people tend to get up and leave.).

None of that deals with how are you handling the common areas such as
hallways, event rooms, entry and so on.  Again, dependent upon location your
hallways on floors with rooms may have no units or units only at ends and/or
in stairways.

The real question is what is your goal, projecting to some semblance of
reality or points.  It if is points I agree with the below, what is most
beneficial :).  If it is reality, good luck, because even if you get all of
the above (and many of the companies are very accurate in what they see as
the occupation as that drives their financial decisions) you can't predict
except very roughly what individual room occupants will do.  If you cater to
us old folks it will probably be set warmer than if it is others :) and most
certainly resort versus airport versus hunting as noted below will be wildly
different.

Anyway I suggest speak to the owner/hotel management folks about what their
projections are as they typically project for every night although they may
only want to share weekly or monthly occupancy and ask them if they try to
fill lower or upper or by section/wing first.

Thanks

Good luck.

This is a common problem, typically nothing is typical.  It is all up to
judgment.

The "typical patter" is hard to define.  My parents are part owners of the
hotel in a small town.  Typically it is empty but it fills up during
holidays, the busiest holiday is Opening Day of Hunting Season.  I'm sure
Vegas has a different "typical patter" as does the KC air port hotel, ect.  

If I was modeling 200 guest rooms and wanted different schedules I would
make
5 schedules. A, B, C, D and E, then assign them to the various guest rooms.
To create the schedules I would suggest talking to the owner, use judgment,
and keep in mind the goal/purpose of the model. [And see what give you the
most point. :-P]

This is just a discussion point but 'Guest rooms' are either occupied or
not.
>From what I understand, if you have 10 offices each with 1 person and the
occupancy schedule says 25%, it means that there is 1/4 of a person is in
each office (Happy Halloween!).  But offices are usually on a common system.
Each guest room will be independent, so I would assume the guest room
schedules will either be 100% or 0%.

Dear Forum,
Assuming:

*        10 story hotel with 200 guest rooms facing all compass directions 

*        Each guest room has HVAC and outdoor air from a through-the-wall
heat pump

How can I create a simple modeling scheme and schedules which will reflect
normal occupancy variations?

As I think about it, the reality of operation is quite different than a
central HVAC unit, because random individual rooms can be completely off,
while others are on.  Room temperature, ventilation and fan power are all
affected.  There will be no predictable pattern for which rooms are unused
or
unoccupied.  ASHRAE does have some typical use patterns in their 90.1 User
Manual but, for example, they assume 100% on time for fans.  That's too
coarse for my taste, and will overestimate energy substantially.

I REALLY don't want to model 200 individual zones with varying schedules!  I
know that I'm not the first one to wrestle with this idea, so I am hoping
for
some creative insight from you.

Thanks in advance!

My interpretation of Table 4.3.3.4 and Appendix E is that it should be 10.8W/m2, based on Space Function Storage Garage.

Greetings.

 

I assume that "standalone parking structure" refers to a multi-level building dedicated to car parking, and not an exterior parking lot.

 

Based on space functions, 10.8 W/m? seems to correspond to your description; I have the same understanding. However, noting that the building type method gives about 3 W/m? (depending on building area), I would suspect that there is a lot of other space types to account for.

 

MNECB does not appear to have any lighting prescriptions for exterior parking lot, if that is what you meant.

 

Hope this helps...

 

Regards,
