Subject: [Bldg-sim] Actual HVAC Heat Load Calculations Vs Heat Load
	Calculations as per LEED
Message-ID: <20100701061637.GA64231@mail19e.g19.rapidsite.net>

Hi,

 

For LEED Energy Modeling generally we consider software of DOE, EQUEST,
TRANE, HAP etc..

 

To design a Heat load calculations for HVAC generally considered the exact
load in the Building and to comply for LEED Requirements of EAC1 - Optimized
Energy Performance we need to consider 25% of Process Load cost which is
much less. 

Cooling load will be different when we compare between Actual Heat Load and
the Heat Load as per LEED. I hope I'm correct.

 

I received a comment from LEED Reviewer, that "Proposed model should reflect
all the HVAC equipment in the actual design at actual component capacities" 

 

Please guide me how to model in Propose Design. 

 

Thanks & Regards,

Ashraf

Ashraf,

 

There have been several discussions on this topic before so you might do
a quick search if you need more in-depth background information. The 25%
is actually more of a guidance number and is what is typically expected
for an office building here in the US. There is nothing in LEED that
states you can't be less than 25% - you just have to document why and
submit it along with the EAc1 template. The 25% is also a suggested
minimum number - not a maximum. Long story short - you should model your
building as it will be operating - this includes the process loads. If
you building has greater than 25% process load then you don't need to do
anything else. If it is less then you will need to submit additional
documentation.

Be aware that RETScreen includes "destratification savings" for industrial buildings, which in one evaluation I did turned out to be a significant fraction of the calculated savings. This may or may not be appropriate for your situation. See page SAH21 of the Engineering & Cases Textbook (3rd edition) for details.

I think RET Screen has a solar air heating module.

Not sure if Norm Weaver is still active on this list, but I think he was working on creating an analysis tool for Solar Wall.

That's typical in my experience.

 

Infiltration is figured primarily based on temperature and pressure
differential (wind speed vs.interior pressurization) across an exterior
surface, among other things.  Lacking any exterior surfaces, I would
presume any "interior cross-zonal infiltration" is generally negligible,
unless you might be dealing with a large positively pressurized
unconditioned space...?

Understanding and Estimating Large Building Infiltration.... One of those
'Defense of the Dark Arts' courses at Hogwarts!
 
Reminds me of a quote from Donald Rumsfield: "... because as we know, there
are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are
known unknowns, that is to say we know there are some things we do not know.
But there are also unknown unknowns - the ones we don't know we don't know"
 
Chew on that one for awhile...
 
If there was such a course, I'd recommend the attached pdf be in the list of
required reading.. If nothing else it's a gold mine refererence for
explaining to your client why 'measuring' infiltration rates in his/her
building, while theoetically possible, it most likely would require an
ENORMOUS amount of cash and airflow to generate a meaningful "reference
pressure". This document is "solid" on the fundamentals. 
 
So, if you want to do it 'right' - this pdf will help you correctly specify
a infiltration measurement test procedure to be performed by a qualified
'Testing Agency. I'd bring several bags of cash with me.
 
The fallback here that many of us may find useful are the 'standards' tables
on pages 5, 6, and 7. If you don't measure, you will have to estimate, and
atleast these 'standards' will give you a sense of how 'non-standard' your
final estimate is.. We have to work with what we have.. 
 
ASHRAE's RP-935: "Protocol for Field Testing of Tall Buildings to Determine
Envelope Air Leakage Rate" - (Available free to ASHRAE members through the
ASHRAE bookstore) is another good reference to get familiar with possible
methods for better understanding the "known unknowns".... As for the
"unknown unknowns" - thank god for ASHRAE research.

Amen to that!

 

Stated another way, almost anyone who thinks they know (with any precision)
the infiltration rate of any building is misinformed.

 

Thanks, Chris, for the references.  I was unfamiliar with them, probably due
to giving up hope for any accurate way to estimate infiltration long ago.  

 

That said, more effort is being spent on understanding and reducing
infiltration in recent years and, while the estimation of infiltration may
not improve, the construction practices which allow infiltration may very
well improve as a result!

There is active research in this area: ASHRAE RP 1478 Measuring Air-tightness of Mid- and High-Rise Non-residential Buildings. This project is focussing on buildings constructed after 2000.

When complete this will go some way to providing data to some of the unknowns...

Amen to that!

Stated another way, almost anyone who thinks they know (with any precision) the infiltration rate of any building is misinformed.

Thanks, Chris, for the references.  I was unfamiliar with them, probably due to giving up hope for any accurate way to estimate infiltration long ago.

That said, more effort is being spent on understanding and reducing infiltration in recent years and, while the estimation of infiltration may not improve, the construction practices which allow infiltration may very well improve as a result!

Vinay et. al:

Understanding and Estimating Large Building Infiltration.... One of those 'Defense of the Dark Arts' courses at Hogwarts!

Reminds me of a quote from Donald Rumsfield: "... because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns, that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns - the ones we don't know we don't know"

Chew on that one for awhile...

If there was such a course, I'd recommend the attached pdf be in the list of required reading.. If nothing else it's a gold mine refererence for explaining to your client why 'measuring' infiltration rates in his/her building, while theoetically possible, it most likely would require an ENORMOUS amount of cash and airflow to generate a meaningful "reference pressure". This document is "solid" on the fundamentals.

So, if you want to do it 'right' - this pdf will help you correctly specify a infiltration measurement test procedure to be performed by a qualified 'Testing Agency. I'd bring several bags of cash with me.

The fallback here that many of us may find useful are the 'standards' tables on pages 5, 6, and 7. If you don't measure, you will have to estimate, and atleast these 'standards' will give you a sense of how 'non-standard' your final estimate is.. We have to work with what we have..

ASHRAE's RP-935: "Protocol for Field Testing of Tall Buildings to Determine Envelope Air Leakage Rate" - (Available free to ASHRAE members through the ASHRAE bookstore) is another good reference to get familiar with possible methods for better understanding the "known unknowns".... As for the "unknown unknowns" - thank god for ASHRAE research.


All the Best,

That's typical in my experience.

Infiltration is figured primarily based on temperature and pressure differential (wind speed vs.interior pressurization) across an exterior surface, among other things.  Lacking any exterior surfaces, I would presume any "interior cross-zonal infiltration" is generally negligible, unless you might be dealing with a large positively pressurized unconditioned space...?

Hello,

While performing energy modeling, I am guessing it is enough if we account infiltration just for the zones in contact with the exterior environment? Am I right?
Or do we have to include interior zones in infiltration calc?

Thank you.

Do you not feel that door blower tests on small, airtight domestic
buildings, as required for passivhaus certification, are not
reasonably accurate?

I quite agree that for large or very leaky buildings there is a real
problem, but I don't agree that there is no such thing as
sufficiently-accurate testing, and the passivehaus people are nothing
if not careful and rigorous about the science.

Dear Wookey,

A blower door test is probably the best way to get a good idea of
infiltration / leakage.  It is, however, an extrapolation of a VERY limited
test.  If you limit your test buildings to small and "airtight" (i.e.,
constructed purposefully by a knowledgeable contractor to be tight) and the
HVAC system does not affect the building pressure, the blower door probably
does a good job.  I was thinking of a much broader type of building.

Message-ID: <474780.85685.qm@web53706.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hello,
I have?two questions about some of the inputs in EPW (weather) files, and any advice would be greatly appreciated.? 
1. According to the help files, EnergyPlus either uses the Horizontal Infrared Radiation Intensity or calculates it using the Opaque Sky Cover.? We are making a custom EPW file from our own weather station data, and we do not have either of those variables.? We do have Direct Normal Radiation, Diffuse Horizontal Radiation, and Global Horizontal Illuminance.? Does anyone have any advice for overcoming this hurdle, for example could we estimate the Opaque Sky Cover from our available data?
2.? We also do not have Atmospheric Station Pressure.? I was wondering how this information is used in the simulations and what would be the best way to deal with this missing data.
Thank you in advance!
Sincerely,
Holly

Call for papers for a special issue of the Journal of Building Performance Simulation on
'Olympic venues and infrastructure'

The publisher of the Journal of Building Performance Simulation, Routledge, intends to produce a collection of special issues of journals that deal with the Olympic and Paralympic Games of London 2012. Olympic and Paralympic Games generate substantial construction projects in the host country, involving the development of flagship stadia, athlete and press accommodation, and many other spin-off projects. These projects will have worldwide attention during the games. It is therefore crucial for the host nation to ensure they are high performance, state-of-the-art facilities. In this context, a Special Issue of the Journal of Building Performance Simulation invites contributions which address the building performance of Olympic Venues - especially those for London 2012.

For those interested in contributing, please visit http://www.ibpsa-england.org/news/call-for-papers-journal-of-building-performance-simulation for further information about the special issue.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE baseline sizing
Message-ID: <AANLkTikWVpNUwGA-kAaVRUTgG8Gp2m4yd8SOuxWck1-7@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

Following up on an earlier email. I calculated Rated Capacities for
Heating/Cooling by sizing 1.25/1.15 respectively and I use EnergyPlus to do
this. But, when I plug these numbers to the respective fields and leave the
rest auto-sized, it gives me an error message saying the Rated Vol Flow Rate
per Watt is less than Min Rated Vol Flow Rate per Watt. Have you come across
this situation before? Any help would of great use.

Thank you.

Regards,
Vinay

Hello-

I would very much appreciate any recommendations on the available programs
for generating E+ geometry.  I have experience w/ eQUEST, and had some brief
experience with OpenStudio/E+.  However, I'd like to devote some time to
learning one of the tools/methods better.  Any insight people might have on
the following would be appreciated:

1)  Translation of DOE-2.2 LOADS information to DOE-2.1e, and then using the
E+ DOE2Translator program to generate the E+ geometry.
2)  Experience w/ stability of Google SketchUp 7.1 and OpenStudio v1.0.5?
My experience is with the previous versions of OpenStudio and SketchUp 7.  I
found it would unexpectedly crash.  Any noticeable improvements with the
newer versions, stability or otherwise?
3)  Other preferred geometry creation tools, and briefly why you prefer
them?

Thanks in advance for your help,
L. Jackson

Maybe someone can answer this for me:

?Using ASHRAE 90.1-1999 at the reference standard, what is the HVAC system
for the baseline building if the proposed building is a ground-source heat
pump with radiant heating and cooling?  In Figure 11.4.3, the standard
indicates that System 6 should be used.  System 6 is listed as a
water-source heat pump with direct expansion for cooling and electric heat
pump and boiler for heating.  Is System 6 distributed water-source heat
pumps with a boiler for heat and a fluid cooler for cooling?  Or is it a
ground-source heat pump with a boiler for peak demand and domestic hot
water??

Thanks.

Hi Chris,

 

Using Figure 11.4.3, the first step is to identify the principle heating
source (I would assume there are backup boilers for the ground-source heat
pumps in the proposed design). Per ASHRAE 90.1-1999 - 11.4.3.k.2, for
systems with mixed fuel heating sources, the principle heating source is the
one with the largest total installed output capacity. Hence, the Baseline
Case should be modeled as system 6 only if the total output capacity of the
geothermal heat pumps is larger than the total output capacity of the backup
boilers.

 

In response to your second question, system 6 is distributed water-source
heat pumps with an atmospheric boiler (80% efficiency) and an axial fan
cooling tower with two-speed fans.

 

Regards,

Hello All,

While I auto-size a run period and obtain values from that simulation and
plug it into the simulation next time, I come across a situation which I
would like to clarify.
I auto-size and obtain the values of Rated Cooling Capacity. And the problem
I am facing is in inputting the Rated Air Flow Rate. What value should go in
this field? Is it the max. air flow rate or the air flow rate that satisfies
the cooling load? When I use the air flow rate that satisfies cooling load,
I see that the Rate Vol Flow rate (m3/s) per Watt of the Rated Cooling
Capacity is less than the minimum specified in the I/O reference (0.000040).

Any help would be great.

Thank you.

Regards,
Vinay

I'm pretty sure that your fan power allowance in 90.1 is for all fan energy (including exhaust). So for example if your baseline fan allowance is 20kW (hypothetical), you will need to apportion that allowance between supply and exhaust similar to your designed building.

There was an extensive discussion about this around a year ago on this list (check the archives).

Vikram,

Thanks for your reply.

So, does it mean I will have to model the exhaust fan in the baseline model
but in a fashion such that it consumes power proportionate to your proposed
design (supply, return and exhaust) but falls within the Allowable Fan
System bhp value of Appendix G. Am I right?

Thank you.

Exhaust fan power is to be the same for both designs. You apportion the remaining baseline fan power allowance between supply and return/relief.

Vikram,

Thanks for your reply.

So, does it mean I will have to model the exhaust fan in the baseline model but in a fashion such that it consumes power proportionate to your proposed design (supply, return and exhaust) but falls within the Allowable Fan System bhp value of Appendix G. Am I right?

Thank you.

Reduction in energy relates directly to  EAc1 and can be accounted for in that credit.  No ID credit would be available for reducing peak load.

RE: innovation in design credit for reduction in peak energy load


 

Has anyone applied for and/ or gotten an innovation in design credit for reduction in peak energy load for any version of LEED? We're working on a project under LEED NC v2.2 and have significant reduction in lighting load during peak hours by using solatubes.

Please provide any contact info and details if you can.

I appreciate the assistance. It seems like the energy model can be manipulated to show the project savings during peak times and that would be enough information needed for a submittal to the GBCI.

THANKS for being LEEDers!!

On this same note, are there any worthwhile ID credits related to energy or energy innovations? I'm sure I can look into it, but half the time other ID credits see pretty far-fetched or too project-specific. I heard mumblings a while back about pre-wiring/designing/stubbing or space-allocation for future renewable energy (much like maximize open space - although in this case reserving infrastructures and space for equipment, not native plantings).

Much thanks

Second on Robert's comment.  That is not enough to get an ID credit.

Reduction in energy relates directly to  EAc1 and can be accounted for in that credit.  No ID credit would be available for reducing peak load.

Thanks for your reply.

So, does it mean I will have to model the exhaust fan in the baseline model but in a fashion such that it consumes power proportionate to your proposed design (supply, return and exhaust) but falls within the Allowable Fan System bhp value of Appendix G. Am I right?

Hopefully you can use a time-of-day or demand rate schedule from the local
utility in place of the state average pricing, which will give credits to
your proposed design for demand management -- depending on the difference
between peak/off-peak from the utility, and the other large demand users in
the building of course.



As another poster or two mentioned, the ID credits won?t cover those items
included in existing credits ? except in the case of exemplary performance.
You don?t mention if this is the 11th EAC1 credit your are pursuing, you may
have a chance then?



Or else if you can get a letter from the utility talking about how your
demand management strategies have benefitted the local grid, even though no
cost savings is associated with the measures on-site due to the tariff in
place.

Keeping in mind that the whole point of ID credits is to be
"innovative", I would personally like to see more effort going into
reduction of plug loads. We generally just shrug our shoulders and
assume there is little we can do about that big chunk of energy that we
model identically between our base and proposed models, but that is
perhaps the biggest opportunity for further energy savings once
envelope, lighting, HVAC and DHW use are optimized. Energy display
kiosks and related educational efforts can be attempted for ID credit,
though I'm not sure how often points are granted. I'd love to hear about
some of the creative ways to tackle plug loads that people have come up
with. Don't assume clients won't hear you out and be receptive next time
you present an innovative idea at a LEED Charrette.

Polytechnic of Milan.
Some of my friends (researcher at university) forwarded your e-mail to me.
Currentely I'm using  Energy Plus software to developed my thesis.
My thesis argument is about heat pump technology (ground source and air

I was interested for this postdoc position, so I though to contact with you.

Please let my know if you think that my canditature can be competitive for

Dear Modelers,

 

An A/E client is pursuing a project which wants to receive LEED Platinum for
a 2,000 square foot Subway restaurant.  I don't know Subway's "back of the
house" operations, but this sounds like a small restaurant with very little
cooking, plus "normal" lights and people.

 

My client thinks that Platinum certification will probably require ~30%
improvement over the Baseline energy use.

 

My question for you is this:

Assuming that we'll use top notch envelope and lighting systems, what HVAC
system do you think will enable 30% savings for such a small building?
(Forget cost for the moment, just brainstorm!)

 

Thanks in advance.

Think about micro-CHP in combination with absorption chiller, chilled
ceilings etc..

 

At my former position I worked to design a very energy efficient Mc Donald?s
branch. It uses geothermal energy for heating and cooling. It is located near
Bremen, Germany. (google Mc Donald?s, Achim, Germany, EE-tec ? and then
translate) 

 

It was a hard fight, because the central regulations of McD USA didn?t allow
to use chilled ceilings, heat-pumps, PV, LED-lighting, new induction roasting
pans etc.

use vestibules for all doorways
I would suspect the internal heat load from baking bread is high so maybe put
the breadwarmer/baking appliance with heat recovery to preheat water or vent
air as well as heat recovery for ice making etc.
usually subway's have large windows so glass frame is important and reduce
water use!

location, location, location of subway is important and should be considered
in regards to walking & biking (if possible in that climate), bus routes both
public and private such as University shuttles and any local train/metros.

For platinum I would also encourage them to include a green purchasing policy
to include plastics, paper goods and such.

Hi All,

 

Does anyone have access to weather files in Iraq?

 

I am looking for one in Al Najaf which is central Iraq, but anything
closer than Tehran and Kuwait would be great.

I'm assuming this is in Michigan. I'd bet on CO2 ventilation control
(although I'm not sure what the exhaust requirements are). You may even
only need a single CO2 sensor, although it will make control system
selection a little more interesting. Avoid in-slab radiant - night
setback will be important. An energy recovery unit may work out as well
(~5 year payback?), considering the high occupant density, cold winters,
and humid summers (Michigan makes you appreciate the blue sky). 

 

Sounds like one that you can have a little more fun with though, so some
of the other more creative ideas may work out well too. Good luck.

Dear Modelers,

 

An A/E client is pursuing a project which wants to receive LEED Platinum
for a 2,000 square foot Subway restaurant.  I don't know Subway's "back
of the house" operations, but this sounds like a small restaurant with
very little cooking, plus "normal" lights and people.

 

My client thinks that Platinum certification will probably require ~30%
improvement over the Baseline energy use.

 

My question for you is this:

Assuming that we'll use top notch envelope and lighting systems, what
HVAC system do you think will enable 30% savings for such a small
building?  (Forget cost for the moment, just brainstorm!)

 

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

 

What software do you suggest for Modeling Commercial buildings?

 

I live in Michigan work for a company doing energy audits from
5000-120000 square feet.

 

Energy Plus -over my head

equest-CA defaults

DOE 2.1 or DOE 2.2 ?

 

Would like a free option and one that I have to buy?

Thank you

Hi Bill,

 

I've found it's very difficult, if not impossible, to control in the
actual building, especially as your slab thickness increases. The slab
can't cool at night and heat back up fast enough to get any meaningful
comfort control and energy savings. A controls contractor might try it
if there's a secondary heat source (probably just an 80% efficient
furnace in situations like this), but normally they just get overwritten
to a constant temperature. If you have someone who can spend a good
chunk of time commissioning it, you might be more successful... Has
anyone had better luck with this than me?

Message-ID: <AANLkTinRCaNyVpV8N3KBjEP_uBs-YZnG1i7GxrzzO1bz@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I am using EnergyPlus to model a building according to ASHRAE App. G for
baseline case. I included Zone exhaust fans in the baseline as advised, in a
fashion similar to what is prescribed in the proposed design. But, when I
auto-size the model with this Zone Exhaust Fan object, I get a warning
message saying -

**   ~~~   **   there is unbalanced exhaust air flow.
**   ~~~   **   Unless there is balancing infiltration / ventilation air
flow, this will result in
**   ~~~   **   load due to induced outdoor air being neglected in the
simulation.

And, I think the design loads are increased due to this, which would
probably cause over-sizing.

Any help in solving this issue would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

Regards,
Vinay

Hi James,

Sounds like fun and you're getting all kinds of cool ideas!

There is a locally owned pizza parlor here in Portland that has done many
inventive things. Below is the like that you can read at your leisure. They
have great pizza, too!

Hot Lips Pizza:
http://www.hotlipspizza.com/about/sustainability/greenpower.html

The page you'll open to covers a cool sounding refrigeration technology.
They quote a 30% energy savings just from using it. There's a lot more on
their website including the use of locally grown organic ingredients,
sustaining bees, composting, etc., etc. I'm sure you'll find some ideas
applicable to Subway's, if not all of them.

It would be fun to hear how this turns out for you. Maybe you can make a
presentation at IBPSA's conference or an ASHRAE conference or somewhere.

Cheers,
Carol

To reduce refrigeration loads, you might want to look at hardware that 
will improve the efficiency of walk-in coolers - like FreeAire.

This product also has the capability of introducing outdoor air directly 
into the coolers to replace refrigeration entirely when the outdoor air 
is cold enough.

I'm assuming this is in Michigan. I'd bet on CO_2 ventilation control 
(although I'm not sure what the exhaust requirements are). You may even 
only need a single CO_2 sensor, although it will make control system 
selection a little more interesting. Avoid in-slab radiant -- night 
setback will be important. An energy recovery unit may work out as well 
(~5 year payback?), considering the high occupant density, cold winters, 
and humid summers (Michigan makes you appreciate the blue sky).

 

Sounds like one that you can have a little more fun with though, so some 
of the other more creative ideas may work out well too. Good luck.

Dear Modelers,

 

An A/E client is pursuing a project which wants to receive LEED Platinum 
for a 2,000 square foot Subway restaurant.  I don't know Subway's "back 
of the house" operations, but this sounds like a small restaurant with 
very little cooking, plus "normal" lights and people.

 

My client thinks that Platinum certification will probably require ~30% 
improvement over the Baseline energy use.

 

My question for you is this:

Assuming that we'll use top notch envelope and lighting systems, *what 
HVAC system* do you think will enable 30% savings for such a *small 
building*?  (Forget cost for the moment, just brainstorm!)

 

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

 

What software do you suggest for Modeling Commercial buildings?

 

I live in Michigan work for a company doing energy audits from 
5000-120000 square feet.

 

Energy Plus -over my head

equest-CA defaults

DOE 2.1 or DOE 2.2 ?

 

Would like a free option and one that I have to buy?

Thank you

 

Mike

It sounds like it's part of the Green Guide for Health Care (GGHC). Is it
not at the back of it somewhere? I wonder why they mandate what program you
use? Why not eQUEST and DOE2.2?

Hi Vinay,

You are getting that error because EnergyPlus does not currently take
exhaust fans into account when autosizing zone airflows. In your case,
EnergyPlus sized the supply airflow for that zone lower than the exhaust
flow rate, and that's why you are getting that error.

To fix this, you can 'force' the supply airflow to be equal to or larger
than the exhaust airflow at all timesteps. You can do this by setting the
autosize value in the airflow parameter for the air terminal unit object for
that zone equal to the exhaust airflow. For example, where you are using
constant volume reheat:

!-   ===========  ALL OBJECTS IN CLASS:

Paul,

Thanks for your reply. I understand that the supply airflow should be equal
or greater than the exhaust airflow. But, the design airflow from auto-sized
runs give me higher CFM than my exhaust fan CFM. But, the problem maybe, it
is not higher always. Is there any method using which I can simulate my Zone
Exhaust fan operation proportional to the supply fan operation so that the
exhaust fan doesn't pull out a constant CFM?

Thank you.

Regards,
Vinay

All, 
I do not have this document - so, unfortunately I can't comment on your specific 
question.  But, I find it very strange that the Guide would  specify what 
modeling software to use.  90.1 - Appendix G does not take this approach - it 
only requires that the modeling software have certain capabilities and meet 
certain standards.  Can anyone enlighten me as to why the Green Guide for Health 
Care would specify which modeling software has to be used?

Thanks.
J

Hi Vinay,

I presume by 'not higher always' you mean an object which varies airflow at
the zone level depending on load (say you are modelling a VAV box in that
zone). EnergyPlus doesn't look at the exhaust airflow requirements when
figuring out the supply airflow to the zone. It calculates supply airflow
based on what is needed to maintain space conditions assuming that this
airflow does not exceed the max or min design airflow (take a look at the
Engineering Reference included in EPlus documentation).

So the minimum supply airflow must be greater than the exhaust airflow at
each timestep.

You can do this easily by ensuring that the VAV box max design airflow
multiplied by the VAV box minimum airflow fraction is greater than the
exhaust fan airflow.

Regards,
Paul

Paul,

Thanks for the clarification. But in my case, I am just using a
AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Uncontrolled object. I am not able to define a
minimum supply airflow with this object. Do you have any suggestions on how
I can model in this situation?

Thank you very much.

Regards,
Vinay

Hi Vinay,

No problem. Would you mind describing the overall system that you would like
to model?

For example, is it a single zone system where the exhaust air flow varies
proportionally to the supply flow rate (as you mentioned before)? If so
model the exhaust fan as a return fan and set the outdoor air economiser to
NoEconomiser.

Regards,
Paul

Paul,

Yes, it is a single zone system. As such, I do not have an OA Economizer.
But, if I already have a return fan, should I just give that fan the CFM of
Zone Exhaust Fan also? Then again, it would result in the same problem
right?

On a different note, if a proposed design has a return fan and is Multizone
system and the baseline is requiring a single zone system. Do I include a
return fan for a each single zone system?

Thank you so much.

Regards,
Vinay

I am wondering how EnergyPlus handles the effect 
of saturated soil in insulation value; especially 
in winter when the damp/wet soil would be 
frozen.  I am interested mostly in heating loads.

This is described in the Engineering Reference (
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/pdfs/engineeringreference.pdf)
beginning on page 133 of the PDF (page number 89).

It depends on the moisture of the soil, plant cover, air temperature,
rainfall, etc.

Thanks Drury - that was just what I was looking for.
In particular I am interested in opinions on the following section 
from Appendix 1:
Design Assumptions & Procedures for Modeling for the GGHC Energy Credits
Ventilation, air changes and air pressure relationships: Use specific 
ventilation rates, air changes, and
pressure relationships, as required by authorities having 
jurisdiction. If the authorities having
jurisdiction have no specific requirements, use the requirements from 
2006 AIA Guidelines for Design
and Construction of Hospital and Health Care Facilities, or most 
recent version.
In particular, considering LEED EAp2/EAc1 and the modelling of the 
outdoor air flow for the Budget case, what is generally accepted as 
"the authority having jurisdiction"?  Hypothetically, could the 
hospital administrator be considered the authority having jurisdiction?

This is how the GGHC views the issued:
Process Ventilation loads: Special ventilation requirements in a 
health care facility are not unusual.
While Table OCC-1 quantifies the typical ventilation in a health care 
facility, some spaces may require
higher ventilation rates. The higher ventilation rates shall be 
simulated in both the Baseline and
Proposed building simulation runs, making this an energy neutral feature.
It would appear to me that for health care facilities, the design 
team is not constrained by the outdoor air amounts quoted in various standards.

Message-ID: <4016B1EA0C8DA84D88D1E20A29CD3E792303093E51@TOR-SVR-EX5.mcw.com>

Hello,

Has anyone run into issues with the report from EE4-OBC? My simulation shows that I have 16% savings over what I assume to be MNECB+OBC but it also states that the building does not comply with NRCAN criteria for new buildings. Is this version of the software still comparing the savings to the 25% threshold? Has anyone had any experience with this?

Thanks,

Hi Oleksandra,

I am pretty sure that your interpretation is correct.  In order to get 
the "complies" criteria it would have to be 25% better than the 
reference (which is now the MNECB modified by OBC as you said)-- but 
there is no requirement for that in either HPNC or NBCP.  (Apologies to 
the list for the use of mysterious acronyms -- just Ontario based 
incentive programs).

Note that a file done in EE4-OBC will open in EE4-v1.7 and vice versa -- 
however you do have to reselect the location each time (because there 
are 5 ON regions in OBC but only 2 under MNECB).  If you don't reselect 
the location, it crashes most spectacularly but it is just the location 
thing causing it.

Cheers!

Brian

You can use LBNL Windows 5 or 6 to obtain this information. Just go to
their website and download the program, which is free. You then enter
you window parameters, area and apply a frame. The program will
calculate the whole window properties for you.

Hi Otto,

Serious Materials provides full frame performance data here: http://index.seriouswindows.com/document-library/Datasheets/. I have also have some of our commercial packages modeled in curtainwall and storefront framing systems that I can provide upon request.

Firstly let me say that Window5 is a great tool - I use it often and love it. The only thing I would advise is that there can be a wide distribution in frame U-factors. The default U-factor for a thermally broken aluminum (TBA) frame in Window 5 is U-1.0. Using THERM and Window5 I've seen TBA frame U-factors vary from as low as 0.8 to as high as 1.5. The resultant full-frame U-factor using these 2 differing TBA frames (and the same glass package) is: 0.29 (R-3.4) for the poorer performing frame, and 0.22 (R-4.5) for the better frame.

I would say that putting either of those full frame u-factors in your energy model will yield pretty different results.

I think it's really important that we, as simulators and modelers, look at full-frame performance because this is the system that will be installed in the building. Center-of-Glass data can be useful comparing two different glass packages, but at the end of the day, it's a framed system that will be installed and a framed system that should be analyzed. My 2?.

Regards,
Alex Krickx

Hi Otto

 

You can download software from the web called window 5 or 6. I think
that can solve your problem. It got a great database of all the
different manufacturers and their products and you can create your own
window with a frame to get the values like u value etc to input into any
software. I used that software to input values into IES-VE and it worked
fine.

 

 Cheers

Message-ID: <004101cb23a3$f1b2f630$d518e290$@com>

Hello,

I am helping to plan a seminar at the IBPSA SimBuild conference in New York
City on August 13th in the afternoon. The tentative title of the seminar is
"BIM Tomorrow", and we will be talking about the future of BIM, extending
BIM beyond design stage, etc.

I am looking for one more speaker, preferably someone involved with research
related to BIM and the built-environment. If you are interested in speaking,
please let me know, and I will forward you more details.

Thanks.

Hi All,
          In one of my project 70% of the building area is
unconditioned only 30% is conditioned, can i neglect the glazing for
unconditioned area and only place the glass in conditioned area or i
have to add glazing in unconditioned area also.

Please suggest me some answer.

Hi - I'm looking for either a doe2 model or a list of modeling parameters
for a prototype commercial building.  Ideally, I'm looking for a model
that's for a typical commercial building around 40,000 square feet that's
been used/validated in other research projects.

 

Anybody have any leads?  Thanks.

Morgan,

DOE has produced several prototypical commercial building models called reference buildings (formerly known as benchmarks) that include 16 different building types.  It sounds like you might be looking for a building similar to the "medium office" one.  These models are in EnergyPlus and are fully functional as is.  If you prefer to use DOE2, though, there are "scorecard" spreadsheets that list all the inputs (in SI units) to the models.  You could take those and build your own DOE2 model.

The models are located at:
http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial_initiative/reference_buildings.html

If you do want to use them in EnergyPlus, note the version number that appears in the .idf, and be sure you're using a matching version.

Are you referring to a prototypical commercial office building?
While at LBNL, I developed a suite of 486 prototypical commercial 
buildings covering 16 building types of three vintages in 16 cities,
that were later generalized to around 120 regional prototypes.

These were originally developed in the early 1990's as DOE-2 files,
but were converted to EnergyPlus in 2005-2007 and now exist as DOE's
benchmark buildings available on the NREL web site.  However, I did
all the development work in DOE-2, and still have all these DOE-2
files, with the intention of putting them on my Web site at some
point.

I can send you the medium office prototype if you're interested.
A distinguishing feature of these prototypes is that the input files
are highly modular and make extensive use of DOE-2 macros to set the
key building parameters (size, number of floors, interior conditions, 
etc.). This makes the building models very flexible and extensible.
After all, I've yet to meet a researcher who just wanted to have an
input file and do a run without any modifications.

Are your prototypes the ones that were converted into the energyplus files
referenced here?

If you had a doe-2 version of the medium office prototype, that would be
really helpful.

Yes and no. My original prototypes were reviewed in a 18-month interlab 
effort between LBNL (where I was at the time), PNNL, and NREL. A team of 
three working under me updated the prototypes to ASHRAE 90.1-2003, as 
well as incorporating comments, received mostly from PNNL and DOE. At 
DOE's request, we also converted the building files from DOE-2 BDL to 
EnergyPlus IDF, and delivered both sets to DOE, PNNL, and NREL. After my 
departure from LBNL in June 2007, NREL continued working on the 
EnergyPlus files, and released them in 2009. I have not looked at these, 
but according to my LBNL colleague these are essentially the same 
building models, although there have been some improvements to the 
system inputs from what I had delivered.

Seven of the models are essentially the same as developed by Joe and colleagues.  The two schools, three retail buildings, small hotel, outpatient, and warehouse models were changed to align with models developed through the Advanced Energy Design Guides published by ASHRAE.  In addition, we added a midrise apartment building.  For the seven models remaining from LBNL, we did make some changes to the HVAC and constructions based on surveys of CBECS and input from the 90.1 committees.

Does anyone have default values for the amount of hot water used per 
day, either per person or per floor area, preferably the former, in 
commercial buildings by building type, i.e., offices, hotels, retail,
supermarket, schools, hospitals, etc. ?

I'm trying to clean up my prototypical commercial building models and 
found those inputs to be highly questionable.

Thanks.

Thanks for the information. I'll look for a copy of the User's Manual.
However, I'm trying to move away from Btu/h to gallons/day or gallons/hr 
profiles that would allow me to account for differing boiler 
efficiencies as well as entering water temperatures by location.

The default values of hot water consumption from the US DOE Commercial
Reference Buildings are in [L/hr] and are available for many
different building types. The "scorecard" spreadsheets that summarize the
inputs and results for each location and building type are particularly
useful as they include the sources for the assumptions (under Zone Summary
tab).

Hi Joe (and Morgan!),
 
I assume that the original prototypical models were developed for DOE-2.1e and not DOE-2.2, but please confirm. I would be interested in looking at these prototypes too if you are willing to share. 
 
Thanks,
Hwakong

  Dear Joe,
In the UK we have the ubiquitous National Calculation Methodology (NCM)! 
This means that any software accredited to perform EPC's or Part L 
analysis under the Building regulations must have Hot water heating 
included in pre-built templates. This makes things nice and simple for 
the user. The tradeoff for this simplicity is inflexibility - which is 
another discussion altogether!
I believe the NCM uses Building Research Establishment (BRE) estimates 
for its source. I will email this personally to anybody interested - 
it's an M$ Access file of 11mb. Email me direct.
Another authorititive source could be the Institute of Plumbing guides. 
I get the impression that the BRE may have referred to this extensively 
for its sources.
Chris

It is my understanding that the user's manual btu/day/person is btu's used
at the tap.  Depending on supply water temperature, you can figure out the
flowrate, and then apply your equipment efficiency.

Hey all:

 

We do not know Alex at all but completely support his position that it is
the entire assembly/full frame in use that counts.   We are a building
envelope consultancy and deal principally in the built market and see this
issue all of the time where the performance of window, storefront and
curtain wall units is dramatically different than that ?calculated? or
provided.   As a matter of fact, it is the unfortunate norm.  At the end of
the day it is about actual in use performance and that performance versus
what was calculated.  I will stay away from installation difference in this
one J.

 

Anyway, we do agree with and have seen the truth to his assessment of frame
differences.  It is only the performance of the entire assembly, at every
level of a structure as a whole, that counts in the real world.  

 

Thanks and take care,

 

Andy

Hi Otto,

 

Serious Materials provides full frame performance data here:
http://index.seriouswindows.com/document-library/Datasheets/. I have also
have some of our commercial packages modeled in curtainwall and storefront
framing systems that I can provide upon request.

 

Firstly let me say that Window5 is a great tool ? I use it often and love
it. The only thing I would advise is that there can be a wide distribution
in frame U-factors. The default U-factor for a thermally broken aluminum
(TBA) frame in Window 5 is U-1.0. Using THERM and Window5 I?ve seen TBA
frame U-factors vary from as low as 0.8 to as high as 1.5. The resultant
full-frame U-factor using these 2 differing TBA frames (and the same glass
package) is: 0.29 (R-3.4) for the poorer performing frame, and 0.22 (R-4.5)
for the better frame.

 

I would say that putting either of those full frame u-factors in your energy
model will yield pretty different results. 

 

I think it?s really important that we, as simulators and modelers, look at
full-frame performance because this is the system that will be installed in
the building. Center-of-Glass data can be useful comparing two different
glass packages, but at the end of the day, it?s a framed system that will be
installed and a framed system that should be analyzed. My 2?.

Good morning Everyone,

 

I agree with both Andy and Alex that the installed assembly is what must be modeled because the assembly values can differ significantly from the center of glass values.  However, more often than not, the fenestration is designed using glazing from one manufacturer which is set in frames by a different manufacturer.  This creates difficulties in determining the assembly value, and modelers have a very hard time accessing testing data for a particular combination of glazing and frame.  Windows5 is often the only tool a modeler has to approximate the assembly values needed for the models.

 

When using Windows5, we never use the default frame values.  We go to the frame manufacturer to get the frame parameters including the U-value and create a custom frame for that project in Windows5.  The same goes for the glazing assembly when the data is not already in the Windows5 database.  By using the actual manufacturers' frame and glazing data, Windows5 can get close to the installed values.

 

Keep in mind that energy models can never exactly match reality.  And, there comes a point in energy modeling when we have to say "close enough".  In any model, that point is reached when the amount of time needed to get a fractional improvement in accuracy becomes burdensome with very little gained in accuracy.  Using Windows5 as outlined above can help to minimize the margin of error with a reasonable amount of effort.  

 

For EAc1 submissions, you can submit the glazing data sheet which shows the center of glass values, the data sheet (or other form of response) from the frame manufacturer, and a copy of the Windows5 report (or a snapshot of the inputs/outputs screen) showing the entire assembly calculated values.  The reviewer will accept this approach.

 

I hope this clarifies things from the energy modeling and LEED perspectives.  Have a nice day.

Important thing to remember with windows is that the real number is the one
that account for actual size and that takes into account angle dependent
properties of glazing.  In most cases, single performance indices at
standard conditions are used (i.e., U-factor, SHGC, and VT at normal
incidence and standard environmental conditions) in an energy model of a
building, which can produce errors anywhere from 10% to a 100%!!  The
correct procedure is to either specify correct configuration and size of the
product, with glazing specified  layer by layer (possible in EnergyPlus) or
use what is called DOE2 or EnergyPlus reports from WINDOW program (DOE2
report is used in DOE2 simulation program and E+ report is used in E+
simulation program).  This is the only way to fully account for changes in
size, angular properties of glazing and actual weather conditions.

 

NFRC (National Fenestration Rating Council) has started to provide DOE2 and
E+ report files in their new CMAST certification system, however number of
products available is still relatively small and is limited to commercial
projects.  EnergyPlus has also implemented in version 5.0 option to specify
standard numbers at standard conditions (like the ones available from
http://search.nfrc.org/search/searchDefault.aspx) and E+ uses then internal
algorithms to provide glazing angular information and correction for actual
conditions.  While it is best to model specific configurations for a window
in THERM and WINDOW program (THERM is required to model frames and edge of
glazing), this is not something that average user will be able to do, so
getting whole product information from the NFRC web site and using E+ option
to convert this data to something resembling real performance is still the
best and easiest way to get actual information.  For commercial products
http://cmast.nfrc.org provides full information that does not need any
simplifications or corrections.

 

Our energy simulation tools DesignBuilder and EFEN use EnergyPlus simulation
engine, with the full range of options mentioned above and also provide
hundreds of predefined fenestration products that can be matched to your
actual product.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Window performance with frames

 

Does anyone know of a window manufacturer web site that has literature on
its windows including the frame? I am using Trace 700 for EA Credit 1 and
the reviewer asked for manufacturer data sheets for window performance
values (U-value, VLT and SHGC) including the frame. 

 

Your help is appreciated,

Mr. Curcija and everyone:

 

If I may be so bold as to ask some "dumb" questions,

 

-          I'm an individual who regularly relies on the DOE2 Glass library (a large excel file attached to any eQuest installation) to find window constructions whose NFRC framed U-value, visible transmittance, and SHGC/SC values best match those prescriptive values given for actual design models and for 90.1 baseline models.  Am I to understand all of my past models have a "10% to 100% error" with regard to the modeled behavior of the glazing?  Please explain!

-          It sounds like the use of Window5 is pretty popular, and this ability to export a file which can be used by DOE2 has me intrigued - has NFRC or any other body decided to make representative report files to match 90.1's baseline envelope requirements to encourage this procedure for comparative studies?

-          Is Window5 the same thing as WINDOW?

-          Furthering Otto's original question, my reaction to a reviewer requiring "VLT including the frame" would be to first roll my eyes and then explain the frame has a VLT of zero, and is modeled distinctly from the glazing which has a VLT of ##%... am I misunderstanding the request there?

 

Thanks!

 

~Nick

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Window performance with frames

 

Important thing to remember with windows is that the real number is the one that account for actual size and that takes into account angle dependent properties of glazing.  In most cases, single performance indices at standard conditions are used (i.e., U-factor, SHGC, and VT at normal incidence and standard environmental conditions) in an energy model of a building, which can produce errors anywhere from 10% to a 100%!!  The correct procedure is to either specify correct configuration and size of the product, with glazing specified  layer by layer (possible in EnergyPlus) or use what is called DOE2 or EnergyPlus reports from WINDOW program (DOE2 report is used in DOE2 simulation program and E+ report is used in E+ simulation program).  This is the only way to fully account for changes in size, angular properties of glazing and actual weather conditions.

 

NFRC (National Fenestration Rating Council) has started to provide DOE2 and E+ report files in their new CMAST certification system, however number of products available is still relatively small and is limited to commercial projects.  EnergyPlus has also implemented in version 5.0 option to specify standard numbers at standard conditions (like the ones available from http://search.nfrc.org/search/searchDefault.aspx) and E+ uses then internal algorithms to provide glazing angular information and correction for actual conditions.  While it is best to model specific configurations for a window in THERM and WINDOW program (THERM is required to model frames and edge of glazing), this is not something that average user will be able to do, so getting whole product information from the NFRC web site and using E+ option to convert this data to something resembling real performance is still the best and easiest way to get actual information.  For commercial products http://cmast.nfrc.org provides full information that does not need any simplifications or corrections.

 

Our energy simulation tools DesignBuilder and EFEN use EnergyPlus simulation engine, with the full range of options mentioned above and also provide hundreds of predefined fenestration products that can be matched to your actual product.

Hey all:

 

We do not know Alex at all but completely support his position that it is the entire assembly/full frame in use that counts.   We are a building envelope consultancy and deal principally in the built market and see this issue all of the time where the performance of window, storefront and curtain wall units is dramatically different than that 'calculated' or provided.   As a matter of fact, it is the unfortunate norm.  At the end of the day it is about actual in use performance and that performance versus what was calculated.  I will stay away from installation difference in this one J.

 

Anyway, we do agree with and have seen the truth to his assessment of frame differences.  It is only the performance of the entire assembly, at every level of a structure as a whole, that counts in the real world.  

 

Thanks and take care,

 

Andy

Hi Otto,

 

Serious Materials provides full frame performance data here: http://index.seriouswindows.com/document-library/Datasheets/. I have also have some of our commercial packages modeled in curtainwall and storefront framing systems that I can provide upon request.

 

Firstly let me say that Window5 is a great tool - I use it often and love it. The only thing I would advise is that there can be a wide distribution in frame U-factors. The default U-factor for a thermally broken aluminum (TBA) frame in Window 5 is U-1.0. Using THERM and Window5 I've seen TBA frame U-factors vary from as low as 0.8 to as high as 1.5. The resultant full-frame U-factor using these 2 differing TBA frames (and the same glass package) is: 0.29 (R-3.4) for the poorer performing frame, and 0.22 (R-4.5) for the better frame.

 

I would say that putting either of those full frame u-factors in your energy model will yield pretty different results. 

 

I think it's really important that we, as simulators and modelers, look at full-frame performance because this is the system that will be installed in the building. Center-of-Glass data can be useful comparing two different glass packages, but at the end of the day, it's a framed system that will be installed and a framed system that should be analyzed. My 2?.

Hi Nick,

I think I know the answer to some of your questions, for some others I'm happy to share my thoughts, and for the remainder I have no clue.

I have always assumed that for the DOE-2 Glass Library that those files have Window5 report files behind them - i.e. they're not just single values for U, SHGC and VT. I could be mistaken though.

Skipping number 2...

I believe that Window5 is the same thing as WINDOW (technically, I think it is called WINDOW5 and there is/soon will be WINDOW6).

Lastly - I've looked into some detail at how full frame U-factors are calculated and how they vary by size. So as a brief tangent, I thought I would look at whether SHGC varies by size too. I found that if a window had, say 0.5 SHGC COG and the window was 90% glass, 10% frame (by area) the resulting full frame SHGC was GREATER than (90%)*(0.5 SHGC). This means to me that the frame has some non-zero SHGC contribution. Granted, it was small (if I remember correctly on the order of 0.1) but still - non-zero!!! In my head I assumed that the frame would reflect additional heat through the window into the space - that may not be correct, but it made sense with my results.  I haven't looked at VT that closely but I would assume the same is true - that the frame adds some small VT to the whole unit.

Regards,
Alex Krickx

Vinay,
 
If I understand you correctly, you want to know what the temperature difference is allowed to be between the actual space temperature and the setpoint temperature to define what an "unmet hour" is. In eQUEST, for example, this parameter is called the "throttling range", with a default value of 2?F for a proportional-type thermostat. Prior posts have suggested increasing the throttling range as a method of reducing unmet hours. I think this should be done as a last resort, but if you do it, you need to keep the same throttling range for both baseline and proposed for Appendix G. Unless the HVAC design is poor, the building has unusual load characteristics, or you are trying to model something outside of the capabilities of the simulation program, high unmet hours are often the result of "problems" in the model - mistakes in simulating the zones, systems, loads etc.

Bill

Hello All,

Appendix G guideline says 300 hours of setpoints not met is acceptable. Is there any Tolerance for heating/cooling setpoints not met? Or the temperatures have to be exact?

Thank you.

Hi All,

 

Why we are all talking about glazing properties, I wanted to see if
anyone had used the new Version of Windows 6 to calculated the glazing
properties of fritted glass. My main question is do we need to get the
manufacture to test the glass with 100% frit on it and then use these
properties for the "glass substrate". And where does the glazing
properties come from for the specular and diffuse optical data.

 

My first guess was that the glass substrate was the glass layer you were
applying the frit to without any properties changed with the use of frit
and that the optical data came from the manufacturer when the glass was
measured with 100% frit.

 

The following is the information on modeling frit from the Windows 6
manual.

 

The properties of the fritted glass must be measured in a
spectrophotometer, with 100% frit coverage on a substrate. The substrate
used to measure the frit is specified when defining the fritted glass in
WINDOW in the Shading Layer Library. The percentage of frit coverage is
input, and WINDOW will calculate the optical properties of the frit
percentage specified

 

Glass Substrate: This pulldown list shows all the records in the Glass
Library. Select the glass layer that was used as the substrate when the
frit was measured. This substrate should not be changed from the
measured substrate - if it is, the calculated results from WINDOW will
not be valid.

 

Frit Coverage: The percent of the substrate that is covered in the frit.
The original measurement to obtain the optical properties of the frit is
based on 100% frit coverage, and with that information, WINDOW can
recalculate the optical properties of the frit at any frit coverage
specified.

 

Specular Reference to the layer in the Glass Library that represents the
specular measurement of the glass 

Diffuse Reference to the layer in the Glass Library that represents the
diffuse measurment of the glass.

Seven of the models are essentially the same as developed by Joe and
colleagues.  The two schools, three retail buildings, small hotel,
outpatient, and warehouse models were changed to align with models developed
through the Advanced Energy Design Guides published by ASHRAE.  In addition,
we added a midrise apartment building.  For the seven models remaining from
LBNL, we did make some changes to the HVAC and constructions based on
surveys of CBECS and input from the 90.1 committees.

Yes and no. My original prototypes were reviewed in a 18-month interlab
effort between LBNL (where I was at the time), PNNL, and NREL. A team of
three working under me updated the prototypes to ASHRAE 90.1-2003, as well
as incorporating comments, received mostly from PNNL and DOE. At DOE's
request, we also converted the building files from DOE-2 BDL to EnergyPlus
IDF, and delivered both sets to DOE, PNNL, and NREL. After my departure from
LBNL in June 2007, NREL continued working on the EnergyPlus files, and
released them in 2009. I have not looked at these, but according to my LBNL
colleague these are essentially the same building models, although there
have been some improvements to the system inputs from what I had delivered.

Christie -

 

The substrate is the glass without the frit. If it is not a glass layer
already in the WINDOW glass library, a spectral data file needs to be
generated from a measurement.

 

Then the substrate with 100% frit is also measured. This allows WINDOW to
have a value for the substrate without the frit and the substrate with the
frit, which along with your input of how much the actual frit coverage is,
will allow the program to do the calculation.

 

In general, although there is much expertise on this list-serve, I would
recommend that subscribers to this list email LBNL directly when they have
questions about our software (WINDOW, THERM, Optics, etc), rather than
posting the question here.

Fei Zhao,

I've done work developing residential prototypes for the Gas Research 
Institute (GRI) starting in the late 80's. The GRI prototypes contain
around 120 detached configurations and 60 attached configurations (16 
locations x 3-7 vintages), all done in DOE-2.1C. You're welcomed to look 
at these, but the "new" vintages would need to be updated from the 80's 
to now, and you would also need to delve into my preprocessing system 
that predates DOE-2 macros.

At this point, I would recommend looking at the generic residential 
model I developed in the late 90's for use in RESFEN and now being
used (with adaptations) for ORNL's web-based Roof Savings Calculator. 
What's makes the model generic is that the template file is scalable
by building floor area, number of floors (1 or 2), and flexible in 
accepting user-defined location, envelope R-values, window area,
etc. through extensive use of DOE-2 macros.

If you want to look at this generic residential model, you can download 
and install the RESFEN program from the LBNL Window Group website. Then, 
go to DATA subfolder and look for template.new, which is the DOE-2 
template file.

To answer to program name question, WINDOW is the generic name that is
sometimes used for the LBNL software used to model the optical and thermal
performance of windows and other fenestration products. There are currently
2 versions available:

 

-          WINDOW 5.2 which is used by NFRC for their fenestration rating
system.

-          WINDOW 6.2 which is the next version of WINDOW, with all the
modeling capabilities of WINDOW 5.2, but with the major enhancement being
the ability to model ?complex glazing systems?, which includes venetian
blinds, uniformly woven material (such as bug screens), and frits. 

 

Both versions generate data files for windows that can be used by DOE2 and
EnergyPlus, but only for specular glazing systems, not for the complex
glazing systems.

 

These programs can be downloaded at no cost (paid for by the US Dept of
Energy) on our website:

Hi Nick,

 

I think I know the answer to some of your questions, for some others I?m
happy to share my thoughts, and for the remainder I have no clue.

 

I have always assumed that for the DOE-2 Glass Library that those files have
Window5 report files behind them ? i.e. they?re not just single values for
U, SHGC and VT. I could be mistaken though.

 

Skipping number 2


 

I believe that Window5 is the same thing as WINDOW (technically, I think it
is called WINDOW5 and there is/soon will be WINDOW6).

 

Lastly ? I?ve looked into some detail at how full frame U-factors are
calculated and how they vary by size. So as a brief tangent, I thought I
would look at whether SHGC varies by size too. I found that if a window had,
say 0.5 SHGC COG and the window was 90% glass, 10% frame (by area) the
resulting full frame SHGC was GREATER than (90%)*(0.5 SHGC). This means to
me that the frame has some non-zero SHGC contribution. Granted, it was small
(if I remember correctly on the order of 0.1) but still ? non-zero!!! In my
head I assumed that the frame would reflect additional heat through the
window into the space ? that may not be correct, but it made sense with my
results.  I haven?t looked at VT that closely but I would assume the same is
true ? that the frame adds some small VT to the whole unit.

Alex Krickx

Mr. Curcija and everyone:

 

If I may be so bold as to ask some ?dumb? questions,

 

-          I?m an individual who regularly relies on the DOE2 Glass library
(a large excel file attached to any eQuest installation) to find window
constructions whose NFRC framed U-value, visible transmittance, and SHGC/SC
values best match those prescriptive values given for actual design models
and for 90.1 baseline models.  Am I to understand all of my past models have
a ?10% to 100% error? with regard to the modeled behavior of the glazing?
Please explain!

-          It sounds like the use of Window5 is pretty popular, and this
ability to export a file which can be used by DOE2 has me intrigued ? has
NFRC or any other body decided to make representative report files to match
90.1?s baseline envelope requirements to encourage this procedure for
comparative studies?

-          Is Window5 the same thing as WINDOW?

-          Furthering Otto?s original question, my reaction to a reviewer
requiring ?VLT including the frame? would be to first roll my eyes and then
explain the frame has a VLT of zero, and is modeled distinctly from the
glazing which has a VLT of ##%
 am I misunderstanding the request there?

 

Thanks!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Window performance with frames

 

Important thing to remember with windows is that the real number is the one
that account for actual size and that takes into account angle dependent
properties of glazing.  In most cases, single performance indices at
standard conditions are used (i.e., U-factor, SHGC, and VT at normal
incidence and standard environmental conditions) in an energy model of a
building, which can produce errors anywhere from 10% to a 100%!!  The
correct procedure is to either specify correct configuration and size of the
product, with glazing specified  layer by layer (possible in EnergyPlus) or
use what is called DOE2 or EnergyPlus reports from WINDOW program (DOE2
report is used in DOE2 simulation program and E+ report is used in E+
simulation program).  This is the only way to fully account for changes in
size, angular properties of glazing and actual weather conditions.

 

NFRC (National Fenestration Rating Council) has started to provide DOE2 and
E+ report files in their new CMAST certification system, however number of
products available is still relatively small and is limited to commercial
projects.  EnergyPlus has also implemented in version 5.0 option to specify
standard numbers at standard conditions (like the ones available from
http://search.nfrc.org/search/searchDefault.aspx) and E+ uses then internal
algorithms to provide glazing angular information and correction for actual
conditions.  While it is best to model specific configurations for a window
in THERM and WINDOW program (THERM is required to model frames and edge of
glazing), this is not something that average user will be able to do, so
getting whole product information from the NFRC web site and using E+ option
to convert this data to something resembling real performance is still the
best and easiest way to get actual information.  For commercial products
http://cmast.nfrc.org provides full information that does not need any
simplifications or corrections.

 

Our energy simulation tools DesignBuilder and EFEN use EnergyPlus simulation
engine, with the full range of options mentioned above and also provide
hundreds of predefined fenestration products that can be matched to your
actual product.

Hey all:

 

We do not know Alex at all but completely support his position that it is
the entire assembly/full frame in use that counts.   We are a building
envelope consultancy and deal principally in the built market and see this
issue all of the time where the performance of window, storefront and
curtain wall units is dramatically different than that ?calculated? or
provided.   As a matter of fact, it is the unfortunate norm.  At the end of
the day it is about actual in use performance and that performance versus
what was calculated.  I will stay away from installation difference in this
one J.

 

Anyway, we do agree with and have seen the truth to his assessment of frame
differences.  It is only the performance of the entire assembly, at every
level of a structure as a whole, that counts in the real world.  

 

Thanks and take care,

Hi Otto,

 

Serious Materials provides full frame performance data here:
http://index.seriouswindows.com/document-library/Datasheets/. I have also
have some of our commercial packages modeled in curtainwall and storefront
framing systems that I can provide upon request.

 

Firstly let me say that Window5 is a great tool ? I use it often and love
it. The only thing I would advise is that there can be a wide distribution
in frame U-factors. The default U-factor for a thermally broken aluminum
(TBA) frame in Window 5 is U-1.0. Using THERM and Window5 I?ve seen TBA
frame U-factors vary from as low as 0.8 to as high as 1.5. The resultant
full-frame U-factor using these 2 differing TBA frames (and the same glass
package) is: 0.29 (R-3.4) for the poorer performing frame, and 0.22 (R-4.5)
for the better frame.

 

I would say that putting either of those full frame u-factors in your energy
model will yield pretty different results. 

 

I think it?s really important that we, as simulators and modelers, look at
full-frame performance because this is the system that will be installed in
the building. Center-of-Glass data can be useful comparing two different
glass packages, but at the end of the day, it?s a framed system that will be
installed and a framed system that should be analyzed. My 2?.

Christie -

 

The substrate is the glass without the frit. If it is not a glass layer
already in the WINDOW glass library, a spectral data file needs to be
generated from a measurement.

 

Then the substrate with 100% frit is also measured. This allows WINDOW
to have a value for the substrate without the frit and the substrate
with the frit, which along with your input of how much the actual frit
coverage is, will allow the program to do the calculation.

 

In general, although there is much expertise on this list-serve, I would
recommend that subscribers to this list email LBNL directly when they
have questions about our software (WINDOW, THERM, Optics, etc), rather
than posting the question here.

Hi All,

 

Why we are all talking about glazing properties, I wanted to see if
anyone had used the new Version of Windows 6 to calculated the glazing
properties of fritted glass. My main question is do we need to get the
manufacture to test the glass with 100% frit on it and then use these
properties for the "glass substrate". And where does the glazing
properties come from for the specular and diffuse optical data.

 

My first guess was that the glass substrate was the glass layer you were
applying the frit to without any properties changed with the use of frit
and that the optical data came from the manufacturer when the glass was
measured with 100% frit.

 

The following is the information on modeling frit from the Windows 6
manual.

 

The properties of the fritted glass must be measured in a
spectrophotometer, with 100% frit coverage on a substrate. The substrate
used to measure the frit is specified when defining the fritted glass in
WINDOW in the Shading Layer Library. The percentage of frit coverage is
input, and WINDOW will calculate the optical properties of the frit
percentage specified

 

Glass Substrate: This pulldown list shows all the records in the Glass
Library. Select the glass layer that was used as the substrate when the
frit was measured. This substrate should not be changed from the
measured substrate - if it is, the calculated results from WINDOW will
not be valid.

 

Frit Coverage: The percent of the substrate that is covered in the frit.
The original measurement to obtain the optical properties of the frit is
based on 100% frit coverage, and with that information, WINDOW can
recalculate the optical properties of the frit at any frit coverage
specified.

 

Specular Reference to the layer in the Glass Library that represents the
specular measurement of the glass 

Diffuse Reference to the layer in the Glass Library that represents the
diffuse measurment of the glass.

Both the unfritted substrate and the 100% frit layer are put into the Glass
Library, and the program uses those two spectral data files to calculate the
optical properties of the frit that you construct.

The properties of the fritted glass must be measured in a spectrophotometer,
with 100% frit coverage on a substrate. The substrate used to measure the
frit is specified when defining the fritted glass in WINDOW in the Shading
Layer Library. The percentage of frit coverage is input, and WINDOW will
calculate the optical properties of the frit percentage specified

 

Glass Substrate: This pulldown list shows all the records in the Glass
Library. Select the glass layer that was used as the substrate when the frit
was measured. This substrate should not be changed from the measured
substrate - if it is, the calculated results from WINDOW will not be valid.

 

Frit Coverage: The percent of the substrate that is covered in the frit. The
original measurement to obtain the optical properties of the frit is based
on 100% frit coverage, and with that information, WINDOW can recalculate the
optical properties of the frit at any frit coverage specified.

 

Specular Reference to the layer in the Glass Library that represents the
specular measurement of the glass 

Diffuse Reference to the layer in the Glass Library that represents the
diffuse measurment of the glass.

Nick,

 

I haven?t used eQuest in a long time, so I am not sure how is that
windows/glazing list incorporated into the program.  If the list shows NFRC
U, SHGC and VT and internally eQuest uses DOE2 report file, then the answer
to your question is no, there is no 10-100% error.  If eQuest just applies
those fixed values without using DOE2 report, then yes, large errors are
associated with window treatment.

 

NFRC lists specific products for which rating is available.  They are not in
business of providing baselines.  I guess that is more appropriate for
software developers.  That is the reason that in our software tool we have
extensive list of products matching ASHRAE Fundamentals list of typical
windows, which would easily enable user to select 90.1 compliant window.

 

Window5 is WINDOW 5.2, so yes that is the same program.  Please note that
there is already WINDOW 6.2, which now models shading devices and other
diffuse layers, in addition to specular glass.

 

Charlie

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Window performance with frames

 

Important thing to remember with windows is that the real number is the one
that account for actual size and that takes into account angle dependent
properties of glazing.  In most cases, single performance indices at
standard conditions are used (i.e., U-factor, SHGC, and VT at normal
incidence and standard environmental conditions) in an energy model of a
building, which can produce errors anywhere from 10% to a 100%!!  The
correct procedure is to either specify correct configuration and size of the
product, with glazing specified  layer by layer (possible in EnergyPlus) or
use what is called DOE2 or EnergyPlus reports from WINDOW program (DOE2
report is used in DOE2 simulation program and E+ report is used in E+
simulation program).  This is the only way to fully account for changes in
size, angular properties of glazing and actual weather conditions.

 

NFRC (National Fenestration Rating Council) has started to provide DOE2 and
E+ report files in their new CMAST certification system, however number of
products available is still relatively small and is limited to commercial
projects.  EnergyPlus has also implemented in version 5.0 option to specify
standard numbers at standard conditions (like the ones available from
http://search.nfrc.org/search/searchDefault.aspx) and E+ uses then internal
algorithms to provide glazing angular information and correction for actual
conditions.  While it is best to model specific configurations for a window
in THERM and WINDOW program (THERM is required to model frames and edge of
glazing), this is not something that average user will be able to do, so
getting whole product information from the NFRC web site and using E+ option
to convert this data to something resembling real performance is still the
best and easiest way to get actual information.  For commercial products
http://cmast.nfrc.org provides full information that does not need any
simplifications or corrections.

Hi Otto,

 

Serious Materials provides full frame performance data here:
http://index.seriouswindows.com/document-library/Datasheets/. I have also
have some of our commercial packages modeled in curtainwall and storefront
framing systems that I can provide upon request.

 

Firstly let me say that Window5 is a great tool ? I use it often and love

for the better frame.

 

I would say that putting either of those full frame u-factors in your energy
model will yield pretty different results. 

 

I think it?s really important that we, as simulators and modelers, look at
full-frame performance because this is the system that will be installed in
the building. Center-of-Glass data can be useful comparing two different
glass packages, but at the end of the day, it?s a framed system that will be

Alex,

 

Frame VLT is 0, unless it is made of transparent material of some sort.
Frame SHGC is NOT 0, because portion of the heat is absorbed by the frame
and re-directed to inside.  The more conducting the frame the higher the
frame SHGC and vice versa

Hi Nick,

 

I think I know the answer to some of your questions, for some others I?m
happy to share my thoughts, and for the remainder I have no clue.

 

I have always assumed that for the DOE-2 Glass Library that those files have
Window5 report files behind them ? i.e. they?re not just single values for
U, SHGC and VT. I could be mistaken though.

 

Skipping number 2


 

I believe that Window5 is the same thing as WINDOW (technically, I think it
is called WINDOW5 and there is/soon will be WINDOW6).

 

Lastly ? I?ve looked into some detail at how full frame U-factors are
calculated and how they vary by size. So as a brief tangent, I thought I
would look at whether SHGC varies by size too. I found that if a window had,
say 0.5 SHGC COG and the window was 90% glass, 10% frame (by area) the
resulting full frame SHGC was GREATER than (90%)*(0.5 SHGC). This means to
me that the frame has some non-zero SHGC contribution. Granted, it was small
(if I remember correctly on the order of 0.1) but still ? non-zero!!! In my
head I assumed that the frame would reflect additional heat through the
window into the space ? that may not be correct, but it made sense with my
results.  I haven?t looked at VT that closely but I would assume the same is
true ? that the frame adds some small VT to the whole unit.

Alex Krickx

Does anyone know of a window manufacturer web site that has literature on
its windows including the frame? I am using Trace 700 for EA Credit 1 and
the reviewer asked for manufacturer data sheets for window performance

Christie -

 

The substrate is the glass without the frit. If it is not a glass layer
already in the WINDOW glass library, a spectral data file needs to be
generated from a measurement.

 

Then the substrate with 100% frit is also measured. This allows WINDOW to
have a value for the substrate without the frit and the substrate with the
frit, which along with your input of how much the actual frit coverage is,
will allow the program to do the calculation.

 

In general, although there is much expertise on this list-serve, I would
recommend that subscribers to this list email LBNL directly when they have
questions about our software (WINDOW, THERM, Optics, etc), rather than
posting the question here.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Frit in Windows6

 

Hi All,

 

Why we are all talking about glazing properties, I wanted to see if anyone
had used the new Version of Windows 6 to calculated the glazing properties
of fritted glass. My main question is do we need to get the manufacture to
test the glass with 100% frit on it and then use these properties for the
"glass substrate". And where does the glazing properties come from for the
specular and diffuse optical data.

 

My first guess was that the glass substrate was the glass layer you were
applying the frit to without any properties changed with the use of frit and
that the optical data came from the manufacturer when the glass was measured
with 100% frit.

 

The following is the information on modeling frit from the Windows 6 manual.

 

The properties of the fritted glass must be measured in a spectrophotometer,
with 100% frit coverage on a substrate. The substrate used to measure the
frit is specified when defining the fritted glass in WINDOW in the Shading
Layer Library. The percentage of frit coverage is input, and WINDOW will
calculate the optical properties of the frit percentage specified

 

Glass Substrate: This pulldown list shows all the records in the Glass
Library. Select the glass layer that was used as the substrate when the frit
was measured. This substrate should not be changed from the measured
substrate - if it is, the calculated results from WINDOW will not be valid.

 

Frit Coverage: The percent of the substrate that is covered in the frit. The
original measurement to obtain the optical properties of the frit is based
on 100% frit coverage, and with that information, WINDOW can recalculate the
optical properties of the frit at any frit coverage specified.

 

Specular Reference to the layer in the Glass Library that represents the
specular measurement of the glass 

Diffuse Reference to the layer in the Glass Library that represents the
diffuse measurment of the glass.

Hi James,

Sounds like fun and you're getting all kinds of cool ideas!

There is a locally owned pizza parlor here in Portland that has done many
inventive things. Below is the like that you can read at your leisure. They
have great pizza, too!

Hot Lips Pizza:
http://www.hotlipspizza.com/about/sustainability/greenpower.html

The page you'll open to covers a cool sounding refrigeration technology.
They quote a 30% energy savings just from using it. There's a lot more on
their website including the use of locally grown organic ingredients,
sustaining bees, composting, etc., etc. I'm sure you'll find some ideas
applicable to Subway's, if not all of them.

It would be fun to hear how this turns out for you. Maybe you can make a
presentation at IBPSA's conference or an ASHRAE conference or somewhere.

Cheers,
Carol

I'm assuming this is in Michigan. I'd bet on CO2 ventilation control
(although I'm not sure what the exhaust requirements are). You may even only
need a single CO2 sensor, although it will make control system selection a
little more interesting. Avoid in-slab radiant - night setback will be
important. An energy recovery unit may work out as well (~5 year payback?),
considering the high occupant density, cold winters, and humid summers
(Michigan makes you appreciate the blue sky). 

 

Sounds like one that you can have a little more fun with though, so some of
the other more creative ideas may work out well too. Good luck.

Dear Modelers,

 

An A/E client is pursuing a project which wants to receive LEED Platinum for
a 2,000 square foot Subway restaurant.  I don't know Subway's "back of the
house" operations, but this sounds like a small restaurant with very little
cooking, plus "normal" lights and people.

 

My client thinks that Platinum certification will probably require ~30%
improvement over the Baseline energy use.

 

My question for you is this:

Assuming that we'll use top notch envelope and lighting systems, what HVAC
system do you think will enable 30% savings for such a small building?
(Forget cost for the moment, just brainstorm!)

 

Thanks in advance.

Hello All,

I am using EnergyPlus for modeling a building for LEED. And, there are some
restriction on the Rated Cooling Capacity and Rated Air Flow ratio (m3/s per
watt of cooling ratio) for proper operation of EnergyPlus. But
unfortunately, the 20 F sizing air flow and the 15% cooling capacity margin
does not make me achieve the restriction imposed by EnergyPlus. In this
case, would you think of increasing air flow or reducing the capacity as the
best bet?

Thank you.

Message-ID: <3423437.1279563996500.JavaMail.root@wamui-junio.atl.sa.earthlink.net>

Hello -

I'm currently looking at building user interfaces to aid in natural ventilation studies using energy plus.  In order to use an airflow network you need to input the air pressure coefficients for exterior surfaces at specified wind direction angles.

Sources like the EnergyPlus engineering ref and ASHRAE fundamentals suggest that for non-rectangular buildings either CFD analysis or wind tunnel results are required.  They are simultaneously skeptical of CFD results.  I have to assume that most people don't have a wind tunnel in their office.

Dave,
There are a few software tools available to assist in that regard. I 
have made good use of one called TNO CpGenerator 
(http://cpgen.bouw.tno.nl/cp/) which has the added advantage of being free.

	5 Minutes of your time!
Message-ID: <AANLkTikglPl4cEvR7oq_NYMk8eum16CTqom_eQMMzCh2@mail.gmail.com>

Energy modelers,

As a nonprofit organization, Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) would like to
help serve the general energy modeling community by improving
the quality and effectiveness of whole building energy simulation while
making it less time intensive. As part of that effort, we are trying
to identify a few tools, templates, or educational materials that could
serve these goals.

The following is a link to our RMI Toolkit Survey, which we have been
sending out to various professionals to get comments and feedback. The
survey describes twelve of the proposed software tools/templates/educational
materials for development and then asks for a ranking based on which tools
should have the highest priority. The survey also asks for thoughts on other
tools that should be developed and if any similar tools already exist.

*Please complete this survey (which will take no more than 5 minutes) by
this Friday, July 23.*

We have been debating this as well.

As I understand the ASRHAE code, there is no spectral performance specified for the baseline glass.

This leads modelers to use the "simplified" specification for the baseline in an effort to match the ASHRAE numbers exactly.

I second Nick's request for the baseline spectral performances to be published by a National body.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Window performance with frames

Important thing to remember with windows is that the real number is the one that account for actual size and that takes into account angle dependent properties of glazing.  In most cases, single performance indices at standard conditions are used (i.e., U-factor, SHGC, and VT at normal incidence and standard environmental conditions) in an energy model of a building, which can produce errors anywhere from 10% to a 100%!!  The correct procedure is to either specify correct configuration and size of the product, with glazing specified  layer by layer (possible in EnergyPlus) or use what is called DOE2 or EnergyPlus reports from WINDOW program (DOE2 report is used in DOE2 simulation program and E+ report is used in E+ simulation program).  This is the only way to fully account for changes in size, angular properties of glazing and actual weather conditions.

NFRC (National Fenestration Rating Council) has started to provide DOE2 and E+ report files in their new CMAST certification system, however number of products available is still relatively small and is limited to commercial projects.  EnergyPlus has also implemented in version 5.0 option to specify standard numbers at standard conditions (like the ones available from http://search.nfrc.org/search/searchDefault.aspx) and E+ uses then internal algorithms to provide glazing angular information and correction for actual conditions.  While it is best to model specific configurations for a window in THERM and WINDOW program (THERM is required to model frames and edge of glazing), this is not something that average user will be able to do, so getting whole product information from the NFRC web site and using E+ option to convert this data to something resembling real performance is still the best and easiest way to get actual information.  For commercial products http://cmast.nfrc.org provides full information that does not need any simplifications or corrections.

Our energy simulation tools DesignBuilder and EFEN use EnergyPlus simulation engine, with the full range of options mentioned above and also provide hundreds of predefined fenestration products that can be matched to your actual product.

Hey all:

We do not know Alex at all but completely support his position that it is the entire assembly/full frame in use that counts.   We are a building envelope consultancy and deal principally in the built market and see this issue all of the time where the performance of window, storefront and curtain wall units is dramatically different than that 'calculated' or provided.   As a matter of fact, it is the unfortunate norm.  At the end of the day it is about actual in use performance and that performance versus what was calculated.  I will stay away from installation difference in this one :).

Anyway, we do agree with and have seen the truth to his assessment of frame differences.  It is only the performance of the entire assembly, at every level of a structure as a whole, that counts in the real world.

Thanks and take care,

Andy

Hi Otto,

Serious Materials provides full frame performance data here: http://index.seriouswindows.com/document-library/Datasheets/. I have also have some of our commercial packages modeled in curtainwall and storefront framing systems that I can provide upon request.

Firstly let me say that Window5 is a great tool - I use it often and love it. The only thing I would advise is that there can be a wide distribution in frame U-factors. The default U-factor for a thermally broken aluminum (TBA) frame in Window 5 is U-1.0. Using THERM and Window5 I've seen TBA frame U-factors vary from as low as 0.8 to as high as 1.5. The resultant full-frame U-factor using these 2 differing TBA frames (and the same glass package) is: 0.29 (R-3.4) for the poorer performing frame, and 0.22 (R-4.5) for the better frame.

I would say that putting either of those full frame u-factors in your energy model will yield pretty different results.

I think it's really important that we, as simulators and modelers, look at full-frame performance because this is the system that will be installed in the building. Center-of-Glass data can be useful comparing two different glass packages, but at the end of the day, it's a framed system that will be installed and a framed system that should be analyzed. My 2?.

Alex Krickx

Message-ID: <4A015401026CF44ABCC4D2A6A467AA1863A30E@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

Sorry if this question has been asked before, but I couldn't find in the
archives.

 

I think most people know about the LEED-CS EAc1 calculator, where the
energy cost savings is "pro-rated" or "post-processed" to take into
account the fact that the CS Owner/Developer can't control all energy
consuming aspects of the building:

 

https://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=6926

 

However, when you figure out the "Percent of Energy Cost Influenced or
Directly Controlled by the CS Owner/Developer", are you supposed to use
the baseline model or proposed model sub-meter outputs?

 

Clearly, since most of the energy efficiency measures done on LEED-CS
projects are owner controlled (HVAC, envelope, etc), if you calculate
the % controlled (based on cost) for the proposed model, it is going to
be less than if you use the baseline model, since most of the tenant
responsibilities don't change between the two models (plug loads,
lighting, etc).   

 

I feel like the baseline model is the right one to calculate how much
the Owner controls, but wanted to see what people thought.

 

Anyone know for sure?

 

Thanks!

Dear All,

 

Are we talking about the assessment for simple regulatory approval or are we
talking about what a window really is. We have found dramatic variations
between NFRC values and what actually goes into a building. I will not go
into differences in measured infiltration rates as that is too random but
the window framing factor is fairly parametric. 

 

The NFRC tables work on a sample window size (lest say 900mm x 1200mm). This
is quite a small window when compared to most installations but;

-          For windows smaller than the sample size the frame to galls
factor is much higher, 

-          Conversely for large format windows commonly used in residential
& commercial projects the framing factor is much less. In some test cases we
have calculated framing factors changing from 18% to 8% or even less. 

 

Depending on Glass system and framing system this can create some
interesting changes to thermal simulation results. One of my colleagues will
hopefully publish something on this late 2010 or early 2011.

Hi Nick,

 

I think I know the answer to some of your questions, for some others I?m
happy to share my thoughts, and for the remainder I have no clue.

 

I have always assumed that for the DOE-2 Glass Library that those files have
Window5 report files behind them ? i.e. they?re not just single values for
U, SHGC and VT. I could be mistaken though.

 

Skipping number 2


 

I believe that Window5 is the same thing as WINDOW (technically, I think it
is called WINDOW5 and there is/soon will be WINDOW6).

 

Lastly ? I?ve looked into some detail at how full frame U-factors are
calculated and how they vary by size. So as a brief tangent, I thought I
would look at whether SHGC varies by size too. I found that if a window had,
say 0.5 SHGC COG and the window was 90% glass, 10% frame (by area) the
resulting full frame SHGC was GREATER than (90%)*(0.5 SHGC). This means to
me that the frame has some non-zero SHGC contribution. Granted, it was small
(if I remember correctly on the order of 0.1) but still ? non-zero!!! In my
head I assumed that the frame would reflect additional heat through the
window into the space ? that may not be correct, but it made sense with my
results.  I haven?t looked at VT that closely but I would assume the same is
true ? that the frame adds some small VT to the whole unit.

Alex Krickx

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Window performance with frames

 

Important thing to remember with windows is that the real number is the one
that account for actual size and that takes into account angle dependent
properties of glazing.  In most cases, single performance indices at
standard conditions are used (i.e., U-factor, SHGC, and VT at normal
incidence and standard environmental conditions) in an energy model of a
building, which can produce errors anywhere from 10% to a 100%!!  The
correct procedure is to either specify correct configuration and size of the
product, with glazing specified  layer by layer (possible in EnergyPlus) or
use what is called DOE2 or EnergyPlus reports from WINDOW program (DOE2
report is used in DOE2 simulation program and E+ report is used in E+
simulation program).  This is the only way to fully account for changes in
size, angular properties of glazing and actual weather conditions.

 

NFRC (National Fenestration Rating Council) has started to provide DOE2 and
E+ report files in their new CMAST certification system, however number of
products available is still relatively small and is limited to commercial
projects.  EnergyPlus has also implemented in version 5.0 option to specify
standard numbers at standard conditions (like the ones available from
http://search.nfrc.org/search/searchDefault.aspx) and E+ uses then internal
algorithms to provide glazing angular information and correction for actual
conditions.  While it is best to model specific configurations for a window
in THERM and WINDOW program (THERM is required to model frames and edge of
glazing), this is not something that average user will be able to do, so
getting whole product information from the NFRC web site and using E+ option
to convert this data to something resembling real performance is still the
best and easiest way to get actual information.  For commercial products
http://cmast.nfrc.org provides full information that does not need any
simplifications or corrections.

 

Our energy simulation tools DesignBuilder and EFEN use EnergyPlus simulation
engine, with the full range of options mentioned above and also provide
hundreds of predefined fenestration products that can be matched to your
actual product.

Hey all:

 

We do not know Alex at all but completely support his position that it is
the entire assembly/full frame in use that counts.   We are a building
envelope consultancy and deal principally in the built market and see this
issue all of the time where the performance of window, storefront and
curtain wall units is dramatically different than that ?calculated? or
provided.   As a matter of fact, it is the unfortunate norm.  At the end of
the day it is about actual in use performance and that performance versus
what was calculated.  I will stay away from installation difference in this

Anyway, we do agree with and have seen the truth to his assessment of frame
differences.  It is only the performance of the entire assembly, at every
level of a structure as a whole, that counts in the real world.  

 

Thanks and take care,

Hi Otto,

 

Serious Materials provides full frame performance data here:
http://index.seriouswindows.com/document-library/Datasheets/. I have also
have some of our commercial packages modeled in curtainwall and storefront
framing systems that I can provide upon request.

 

Firstly let me say that Window5 is a great tool ? I use it often and love
it. The only thing I would advise is that there can be a wide distribution
in frame U-factors. The default U-factor for a thermally broken aluminum
(TBA) frame in Window 5 is U-1.0. Using THERM and Window5 I?ve seen TBA
frame U-factors vary from as low as 0.8 to as high as 1.5. The resultant
full-frame U-factor using these 2 differing TBA frames (and the same glass
package) is: 0.29 (R-3.4) for the poorer performing frame, and 0.22 (R-4.5)
for the better frame.

 

I would say that putting either of those full frame u-factors in your energy
model will yield pretty different results. 

 

I think it?s really important that we, as simulators and modelers, look at
full-frame performance because this is the system that will be installed in
the building. Center-of-Glass data can be useful comparing two different
glass packages, but at the end of the day, it?s a framed system that will be
installed and a framed system that should be analyzed. My 2?.

Message-ID: <861725.57895.qm@web76002.mail.sg1.yahoo.com>

Hi All, 

I'd like to ask for your advice on the allowable interior lighting power density 
by ASHRAE 90.1-2007. 


One of our clients is planning to go for LEED CI certification for their new 
office in a non-LEED certified base building. 

Under LEED EAp2, it is a mandatory requirements for the installed lighting power 
to be 10% improvement from allowable LPD by ASHRAE 90.1-2007. In addition to the 
general lighting provided at the open plan office areas, the base building 
landlord has also provided the down-light at the building perimeters which are 
controlled separately from the open office general lighting. The perimeter 
lightings are also connected to photo-sensors as well. Those lighting are not 
required for general lighting at all. Since it was provided by the base 
building, it'll be cost implication to remove all the light fittings as well. 


My questions are: 
1)  whether we can consider those lighting as decorative lighting (as per ASHRAE 
90.1-2007) and the space is eligible for the additional lighting power density 
allowance. If yes, what value should I use in calculation. OR
2) Can those perimeter downlights can be exempted from the LPD calculation? 
3) According to ASHRAE 90.1-2007, the ballast loss have to be included in LPD 
calculation. Am I right? 


Any advice/suggestion would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks!

Regards,
Grace

Hi Mark,

I agree with the point you make, but I want to expand the conversation a bit. Specifically, I aim to discuss the difference between how to use NFRC values and how to input values into energy modeling software.

The NFRC value should be accurate for a window of the NFRC standard size. So a standard sized 1200mm x 1500mm fixed window will have a certain U-factor, SHGC and VT as part of its NFRC rating. But a different size will certainly have different performance values. I think NFRC is very useful in comparing Window A to Window B in a standard size, but you are right: once you've selected Window A we need to make sure that we have the right performance parameters for that sized window.

I've been working on some projects that are aiming to be Passive House certified in which case they DO need to know how performance varies with size. We've worked out some formulas to calculate the full frame performance (only for U-factor at this point) on a range of our products. It's tricky because you need to know the U-factor of each component (edge of glass against each part of the frame, each part of the frame, and COG) as well as the areas of each of those components which of course vary with different sized windows.

I'm not sure what other manufacturers are doing to be able to provide this, but we have some of our product lines in a format that we can provide an NFRC-grade value for a non-NFRC sized window.

If you want to see the calculations, you can follow this link: http://index.seriouswindows.com/passive-house.html and click "Download SeriousWindows for Passive House" at the bottom of the page or click here: http://index.seriouswindows.com/document-library/func-startdown/90/.

The document describes how the window is broken into different sections and includes all the necessary info needed to calculate full frame performance.

The last thing I'd like to add: It is probably simpler to upload WINDOW5 data (I know eQUEST can import COG spectral data), specify your window size in the modeling software and specify your frame U-factor. Your software should take all that data and calculate what the full-frame data is pretty accurately.

If anyone has any questions about this, feel free to contact me: generating these formulas took quite a bit of time and I'd be happy to share my learning.

Alex Krickx

Dear All,

Are we talking about the assessment for simple regulatory approval or are we talking about what a window really is. We have found dramatic variations between NFRC values and what actually goes into a building. I will not go into differences in measured infiltration rates as that is too random but the window framing factor is fairly parametric.

The NFRC tables work on a sample window size (lest say 900mm x 1200mm). This is quite a small window when compared to most installations but;
-       For windows smaller than the sample size the frame to galls factor is much higher,
-       Conversely for large format windows commonly used in residential & commercial projects the framing factor is much less. In some test cases we have calculated framing factors changing from 18% to 8% or even less.

Depending on Glass system and framing system this can create some interesting changes to thermal simulation results. One of my colleagues will hopefully publish something on this late 2010 or early 2011.

Hi Nick,

I think I know the answer to some of your questions, for some others I'm happy to share my thoughts, and for the remainder I have no clue.

I have always assumed that for the DOE-2 Glass Library that those files have Window5 report files behind them - i.e. they're not just single values for U, SHGC and VT. I could be mistaken though.

Skipping number 2...

I believe that Window5 is the same thing as WINDOW (technically, I think it is called WINDOW5 and there is/soon will be WINDOW6).

Lastly - I've looked into some detail at how full frame U-factors are calculated and how they vary by size. So as a brief tangent, I thought I would look at whether SHGC varies by size too. I found that if a window had, say 0.5 SHGC COG and the window was 90% glass, 10% frame (by area) the resulting full frame SHGC was GREATER than (90%)*(0.5 SHGC). This means to me that the frame has some non-zero SHGC contribution. Granted, it was small (if I remember correctly on the order of 0.1) but still - non-zero!!! In my head I assumed that the frame would reflect additional heat through the window into the space - that may not be correct, but it made sense with my results.  I haven't looked at VT that closely but I would assume the same is true - that the frame adds some small VT to the whole unit.

Regards,
Alex Krickx

Mr. Curcija and everyone:

If I may be so bold as to ask some "dumb" questions,


-          I'm an individual who regularly relies on the DOE2 Glass library (a large excel file attached to any eQuest installation) to find window constructions whose NFRC framed U-value, visible transmittance, and SHGC/SC values best match those prescriptive values given for actual design models and for 90.1 baseline models.  Am I to understand all of my past models have a "10% to 100% error" with regard to the modeled behavior of the glazing?  Please explain!

-          It sounds like the use of Window5 is pretty popular, and this ability to export a file which can be used by DOE2 has me intrigued - has NFRC or any other body decided to make representative report files to match 90.1's baseline envelope requirements to encourage this procedure for comparative studies?

-          Is Window5 the same thing as WINDOW?

-          Furthering Otto's original question, my reaction to a reviewer requiring "VLT including the frame" would be to first roll my eyes and then explain the frame has a VLT of zero, and is modeled distinctly from the glazing which has a VLT of ##%... am I misunderstanding the request there?

Thanks!

Serious Materials provides full frame performance data here: http://index.seriouswindows.com/document-library/Datasheets/. I have also have some of our commercial packages modeled in curtainwall and storefront framing systems that I can provide upon request.

Firstly let me say that Window5 is a great tool - I use it often and love it. The only thing I would advise is that there can be a wide distribution in frame U-factors. The default U-factor for a thermally broken aluminum (TBA) frame in Window 5 is U-1.0. Using THERM and Window5 I've seen TBA frame U-factors vary from as low as 0.8 to as high as 1.5. The resultant full-frame U-factor using these 2 differing TBA frames (and the same glass package) is: 0.29 (R-3.4) for the poorer performing frame, and 0.22 (R-4.5) for the better frame.

I would say that putting either of those full frame u-factors in your energy model will yield pretty different results.

I think it's really important that we, as simulators and modelers, look at full-frame performance because this is the system that will be installed in the building. Center-of-Glass data can be useful comparing two different glass packages, but at the end of the day, it's a framed system that will be installed and a framed system that should be analyzed. My 2?.

Alex Krickx

Hi Dave,

This paper describes and compares some sources of Cp data.

C?stola D, Blocken B, Hensen JLM. 2009. Overview of pressure coefficient data in building energy simulation and airflow network programs.   Building and Environment 44(10):  2027-2036.

If you don't have access to this journal, you can also download a pre-print version from:
http://sts.bwk.tue.nl/WindEngineering/pdf/BAE_DC_BB_JH_Cp_data_Preprint.pdf


I would also recommend this paper published in the last IBPSA conference, which shows that wind tunnel experiments are more than feasible for large scale projects:

Hi Chris,

Yes it is possible to do. I am just finishing a peer review of a project
that uses one. There has been a lot of discussion about the BSUG
presentation by Dana Troy that you will find in the archives. There is also
a lot of information available from the manufacturers - Mitsubishi and
Daikin - so you can create and enter curve data that reflects the actual
heat pump you are trying to model. Creating curves is not difficult but it
is pretty time consuming. If you are moving heat/cool around the building
then there is post-processing since you can't model it directly in eQUEST.
There can be some problems with using OA-FROM-SYSTEMS to model your DOAS,
too, but nothing that can't be overcome that I've seen.

Bhaskar,
All I can think of is tweaking the min variable air volume. Generally, the min air volume in the VAV system is 30%.
FYI: Oregon building code now has VAV min and max in the heating mode, i.e., 30% to 50% instead of constant 30%.

Dear Alex,

 

I work in the HER validation field , so we need to know that we are
modelling the right fabric matrix (framing factor and windows included). The
software available in Australia only has the NFRC type table for selection,
which is unsuitable for us. The get around the problem we can modify the
data in the software?s scratch file. This is a file the software creates
post data entry before simulation. We open this file and modify lots of
parameters based on ?as-built? observations. 

 

Once you start playing at this level, you actually create as many windows as
you wish. You just need & checking with the data entry. We mainly modify the
framing ratios of a suitable NFRC window to match what is really in the
wall. It is laborious, so I do believe that we need a parametric model
within the HER software which can ultimately make the changes for us. The
only other addition would then be a mullions tool to nominate how many
vertical and horizontal mullions.       

 

We are to discuss this in Australia when I finish my current windowless
project. But I have been advising another researcher with a windowed
project.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Window performance with frames

 

Hi Mark,

 

I agree with the point you make, but I want to expand the conversation a
bit. Specifically, I aim to discuss the difference between how to use NFRC
values and how to input values into energy modeling software.

 

The NFRC value should be accurate for a window of the NFRC standard size. So
a standard sized 1200mm x 1500mm fixed window will have a certain U-factor,
SHGC and VT as part of its NFRC rating. But a different size will certainly
have different performance values. I think NFRC is very useful in comparing
Window A to Window B in a standard size, but you are right: once you?ve
selected Window A we need to make sure that we have the right performance
parameters for that sized window.

 

I?ve been working on some projects that are aiming to be Passive House
certified in which case they DO need to know how performance varies with
size. We?ve worked out some formulas to calculate the full frame performance
(only for U-factor at this point) on a range of our products. It?s tricky
because you need to know the U-factor of each component (edge of glass
against each part of the frame, each part of the frame, and COG) as well as
the areas of each of those components which of course vary with different
sized windows.

 

I?m not sure what other manufacturers are doing to be able to provide this,
but we have some of our product lines in a format that we can provide an
NFRC-grade value for a non-NFRC sized window.

 

If you want to see the calculations, you can follow this link:
http://index.seriouswindows.com/passive-house.html and click ?Download
SeriousWindows for Passive House? at the bottom of the page or click here:
http://index.seriouswindows.com/document-library/func-startdown/90/.

 

The document describes how the window is broken into different sections and
includes all the necessary info needed to calculate full frame performance.

 

The last thing I?d like to add: It is probably simpler to upload WINDOW5
data (I know eQUEST can import COG spectral data), specify your window size
in the modeling software and specify your frame U-factor. Your software
should take all that data and calculate what the full-frame data is pretty
accurately.

 

If anyone has any questions about this, feel free to contact me: generating
these formulas took quite a bit of time and I?d be happy to share my
learning.

Alex Krickx

Dear All,

 

Are we talking about the assessment for simple regulatory approval or are we
talking about what a window really is. We have found dramatic variations
between NFRC values and what actually goes into a building. I will not go
into differences in measured infiltration rates as that is too random but
the window framing factor is fairly parametric. 

 

The NFRC tables work on a sample window size (lest say 900mm x 1200mm). This
is quite a small window when compared to most installations but;

-          For windows smaller than the sample size the frame to galls
factor is much higher, 

-          Conversely for large format windows commonly used in residential
& commercial projects the framing factor is much less. In some test cases we
have calculated framing factors changing from 18% to 8% or even less. 

 

Depending on Glass system and framing system this can create some
interesting changes to thermal simulation results. One of my colleagues will
hopefully publish something on this late 2010 or early 2011.

Hi Nick,

 

I think I know the answer to some of your questions, for some others I?m
happy to share my thoughts, and for the remainder I have no clue.

 

I have always assumed that for the DOE-2 Glass Library that those files have
Window5 report files behind them ? i.e. they?re not just single values for
U, SHGC and VT. I could be mistaken though.

 

Skipping number 2


 

I believe that Window5 is the same thing as WINDOW (technically, I think it
is called WINDOW5 and there is/soon will be WINDOW6).

 

Lastly ? I?ve looked into some detail at how full frame U-factors are
calculated and how they vary by size. So as a brief tangent, I thought I
would look at whether SHGC varies by size too. I found that if a window had,
say 0.5 SHGC COG and the window was 90% glass, 10% frame (by area) the
resulting full frame SHGC was GREATER than (90%)*(0.5 SHGC). This means to
me that the frame has some non-zero SHGC contribution. Granted, it was small
(if I remember correctly on the order of 0.1) but still ? non-zero!!! In my
head I assumed that the frame would reflect additional heat through the
window into the space ? that may not be correct, but it made sense with my
results.  I haven?t looked at VT that closely but I would assume the same is
true ? that the frame adds some small VT to the whole unit.

Mr. Curcija and everyone:

 

If I may be so bold as to ask some ?dumb? questions,

 

-          I?m an individual who regularly relies on the DOE2 Glass library
(a large excel file attached to any eQuest installation) to find window
constructions whose NFRC framed U-value, visible transmittance, and SHGC/SC
values best match those prescriptive values given for actual design models
and for 90.1 baseline models.  Am I to understand all of my past models have
a ?10% to 100% error? with regard to the modeled behavior of the glazing?
Please explain!

-          It sounds like the use of Window5 is pretty popular, and this
ability to export a file which can be used by DOE2 has me intrigued ? has
NFRC or any other body decided to make representative report files to match
90.1?s baseline envelope requirements to encourage this procedure for
comparative studies?

-          Is Window5 the same thing as WINDOW?

-          Furthering Otto?s original question, my reaction to a reviewer
requiring ?VLT including the frame? would be to first roll my eyes and then
explain the frame has a VLT of zero, and is modeled distinctly from the
glazing which has a VLT of ##%
 am I misunderstanding the request there?

 

Thanks!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Window performance with frames

 

Important thing to remember with windows is that the real number is the one
that account for actual size and that takes into account angle dependent
properties of glazing.  In most cases, single performance indices at
standard conditions are used (i.e., U-factor, SHGC, and VT at normal
incidence and standard environmental conditions) in an energy model of a
building, which can produce errors anywhere from 10% to a 100%!!  The
correct procedure is to either specify correct configuration and size of the
product, with glazing specified  layer by layer (possible in EnergyPlus) or
use what is called DOE2 or EnergyPlus reports from WINDOW program (DOE2
report is used in DOE2 simulation program and E+ report is used in E+
simulation program).  This is the only way to fully account for changes in
size, angular properties of glazing and actual weather conditions.

 

NFRC (National Fenestration Rating Council) has started to provide DOE2 and
E+ report files in their new CMAST certification system, however number of
products available is still relatively small and is limited to commercial
projects.  EnergyPlus has also implemented in version 5.0 option to specify
standard numbers at standard conditions (like the ones available from
http://search.nfrc.org/search/searchDefault.aspx) and E+ uses then internal
algorithms to provide glazing angular information and correction for actual
conditions.  While it is best to model specific configurations for a window
in THERM and WINDOW program (THERM is required to model frames and edge of
glazing), this is not something that average user will be able to do, so
getting whole product information from the NFRC web site and using E+ option
to convert this data to something resembling real performance is still the
best and easiest way to get actual information.  For commercial products
http://cmast.nfrc.org provides full information that does not need any
simplifications or corrections.

 

Our energy simulation tools DesignBuilder and EFEN use EnergyPlus simulation
engine, with the full range of options mentioned above and also provide
hundreds of predefined fenestration products that can be matched to your
actual product.

Hey all:

 

We do not know Alex at all but completely support his position that it is
the entire assembly/full frame in use that counts.   We are a building
envelope consultancy and deal principally in the built market and see this
issue all of the time where the performance of window, storefront and
curtain wall units is dramatically different than that ?calculated? or
provided.   As a matter of fact, it is the unfortunate norm.  At the end of
the day it is about actual in use performance and that performance versus
what was calculated.  I will stay away from installation difference in this
one :-).

 

Anyway, we do agree with and have seen the truth to his assessment of frame
differences.  It is only the performance of the entire assembly, at every
level of a structure as a whole, that counts in the real world.

Hi Otto,

 

Serious Materials provides full frame performance data here:
http://index.seriouswindows.com/document-library/Datasheets/. I have also
have some of our commercial packages modeled in curtainwall and storefront
framing systems that I can provide upon request.

 

Firstly let me say that Window5 is a great tool ? I use it often and love
it. The only thing I would advise is that there can be a wide distribution
in frame U-factors. The default U-factor for a thermally broken aluminum
(TBA) frame in Window 5 is U-1.0. Using THERM and Window5 I?ve seen TBA
frame U-factors vary from as low as 0.8 to as high as 1.5. The resultant
full-frame U-factor using these 2 differing TBA frames (and the same glass
package) is: 0.29 (R-3.4) for the poorer performing frame, and 0.22 (R-4.5)
for the better frame.

 

I would say that putting either of those full frame u-factors in your energy
model will yield pretty different results. 

 

I think it?s really important that we, as simulators and modelers, look at
full-frame performance because this is the system that will be installed in
the building. Center-of-Glass data can be useful comparing two different
glass packages, but at the end of the day, it?s a framed system that will be
installed and a framed system that should be analyzed. My 2?.

Alex Krickx

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Window performance with frames

 

Does anyone know of a window manufacturer web site that has literature on
its windows including the frame? I am using Trace 700 for EA Credit 1 and
the reviewer asked for manufacturer data sheets for window performance
values (U-value, VLT and SHGC) including the frame. 

 

Your help is appreciated,

All,

Just a couple of comments. I became frustrated with the glass library data
years ago when I could never find a window that met the Oregon Code values
or the ASHRAE values. So I use Window vs x. It's quick and easy and you can
input data for all your sizes thus you have real output. Size makes a big
difference! I have neglected the frames up until lately because it's been
harder to get data related to them. When you get into it you find that
things like thermal breaks vary wildly in their structures. Who knew? I
thought a thermal break was a thermal break, but no, they can be made out of
various materials and sometimes don't really "break" the heat path at all.
Manufacturers like to use terms like "thermally improved". Just try to find
out what that means. Anyway, since so many windows are custom built in the
field it's good to get as much glass and frame info as possible so you can
accurately model them. Call it one of the final frontiers: a good thermal
break can really save energy. I always suggest it as an opportunity because
I know most developers will not consider them otherwise. They can cost a lot
although how much is debatable.

Last comment, and I apologize in advance Robin, Window is not paid for by
the Department of Energy; nothing is. It's paid for by us using our tax
dollars. At least they are going for something useful wrt Window.

All,
does eQuest have the capability to model the following systems, whether
explicitly or by workarounds?:


   1. Air source VRF heating & cooling
   2. Water source VRF connected to geo-exchange & solar
   3. Capillary mats with geo-exchange.

Thanks everyone

Dear Mark,

Thanks for your reply.

I made an algorithm that screens diffuse & beam radiation from global radiation under clear sky condition 
(reference book: solar engineering of thermal processes).

But I can't find the contents about prediction of solar radiation. 

What I want to know is how can I "forecast" global radiation in future time (1,2,3..hour or 1,2,3...day later).

Thanks in advance.

Dear Kim,
I'm not sure if I understand what you need.? However,?if you are looking for 
"Global Horizontal Radiation" for a simulation, EnergyPlus does not?currently 
use that value according to the E+ Weather Converter?Program documentation.? You 
could enter 9999 for each timestep.? 

?
If you are looking?to calculate?"Horizontal Infrared Ratiation from Sky", Brent 
Griffith from NREL pointed me toward Appendix E in this report:
?

Good luck.

Can anyone help me with an eQuest Weather File conversion error?
When using the eQuest Weather Format Convertor and selecting the
File_IWEC.epw weather file in the eQuest weather folder in my c drive and
clicking "Convert" I get an error saying "Invalid Filename"
Anyone seen this before?

Dear Kim,

We measure site global and diffuse global with our research. As yet we have
not started calibrating mathematical models for calculation Diffuse and
Direct Beam from measured Global.
BUT

Associate Professor John Boland has been developing and publishing
mathematical methods for obtaining Diffuse & Direct beam solar radiation
from observed global. We have used his methods in a few validation
exercises. (Associate Professor John Boland, Associate Professor in
Environmental Mathematics),
http://www.unisanet.unisa.edu.au/staff/Homepage.asp?Name=john.boland
We established problems with the linearity of previously published methods.
The latest Boland & Ridley model provides a more correct curved form to the
data.  

If anyone is forecasting solar radiation, in Australia, John would know.

Dear Mark,

Thanks for your reply.

I made an algorithm that screens diffuse & beam radiation from global
radiation under clear sky condition 
(reference book: solar engineering of thermal processes).

But I can't find the contents about prediction of solar radiation. 

What I want to know is how can I "forecast" global radiation in future time
(1,2,3..hour or 1,2,3...day later).

Thanks in advance.

Dear Building Simulationists,


 


Building Simulation 2011: Simulation in the service of a sustainable, net
zero energy future - first announcement and call for papers

 

The BS2011 Scientific Committee has great pleasure in inviting you to put
the dates 14-17 November 2011 in your calendar as the Building Simulation
2011 Conference in Wellington, New Zealand. 

 

We hope to engage with you in an examination of the role of building
performance simulation in a world that increasingly looks to our community
to deliver buildings that perform better. The construction industry is under
pressure to deliver good quality buildings that meet the needs of their
occupants and at the same time have a zero impact on the environment or
demand on energy resources. Performance simulation is becoming an integral
part of that delivery process

 

CALL FOR PAPERS - from practitioners as well as researchers and software
developers

A formal call for abstracts with details of the submission process at the
www.bs2011.org.nz web site will be released in August. Submission of
abstracts will be by 1 December 2010. Conference brochure can also be
downloaded from this web site.

 

The conference themes are listed below. In line with recent Building
Simulation conference practice, the BS2011 organisers would particularly
like to invite practitioners involved in building design and performance
assessment to relate their experiences using simulation software, to hear
what others are up to, and to interact with the worldwide community of
software developers. An 'applications day' has been set aside for this
purpose within the overall conference programme.

 

KEY DATES

The following key dates should go into your diary now:

 

2010

Dec 1          Abstracts due (Monday)

 

2011

May 9           Full papers due

Sep 12          Deadline for early conference registration

Nov 9            Deadline for conference online registration 

Nov 14-17    BS '11 Conference

 

OVERVIEW

The International Building Performance Simulation Association Conference,
gathers the world's leading experts and researchers on all aspects of
modelling and simulation of the performance of the built environment. The
aim of this prestigious conference, which is held every two years, is to
share leading-edge ideas, and to explore ways in which performance
simulation can enhance the quality of life and sustainability provided by
our built environment. Recent conferences have been held in Beijing and
Glasgow and attracted over 300 papers on a broad range of topics from
advances in modelling light heat and sound in buildings to practical case
studies of the role of simulation in design practice. 

 

The host of BS2011 is IBPSA Australasia.

 

CONFERENCE THEMES:

The committee is interested in all aspects of the simulation of the
performance of buildings and suggests the following themes may help organise
your thoughts in preparation of a relevant abstract and paper: 

1. advances in the modeling of building energy and mass flows - light, heat,
sound, and air

2. developments in the modeling of human comfort and performance in the
built environment

3. improvements in the empirical and theoretical modeling of building
systems (HVAC or openable windows, or dynamic shading systems)

4. the role of simulation in commissioning and operation and integration
with building automation systems

5. the integration of energy capture and conversion models into building
performance simulation

6. advances in applications including modeling micro-climate; simulating
Indoor Air Quality; integrating performance simulation into the building
delivery process.

7. demonstration of the reliability of simulation through validation and
calibration

8. practical studies of the role of simulation in design practice -
including case studies of user interactions with the software

9. examination of the role of simulation in regulation and code compliance

 

LOCATION:

Wellington (http://www.wellingtonnz.com/), as the cultural as well as the
political capital of New Zealand, offers an unrivalled opportunity to engage
with New Zealand's unique Pacific mix of cultures in times out of the
conference programme. The timing of the conference is such that you should
be able to enjoy the delights of Spring in New Zealand and avoid the crowds
gathering in the country for the Rugby World Cup
(http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/ Sept 9 - Oct 23 2011). 

 

We look forward to seeing you at BS2011 in Wellington.

 

Yours sincerely,

All,

we regularly design and model buildings which rely in part on natural
ventilation as a source of free cooling. The issue we are often faced with
is how to capture this benefit when performing a LEED Appendix G analysis.
Appendix G states that all conditioned spaces must have BOTH heating and
cooling. We would like to remove mechanical coolig in the proposed design
building and thus gain benefit when comparing to the mechanical cooling
system in the reference baseline building.

Has anyone tackled this issue and come to a satisfactory resolution?

Thanks for your help.

I am currently doing a naturally ventilated building for LEED and I
believe that if the space is achieving indoor temperatures between the
given set point using natural ventilation than the mechanical system
energy is 0 for the proposed design. Any hours where natural ventilation
can't achieve indoor temperatures within the set points, a mechanical
system needs to be modeled even if there isn't one in the proposed
building. This helps keep the unmet hours within the requirements for
LEED.

 

Cheers,

And how did you model the natural ventilation?
In summer when external temperatures are above the room setpoint natural
ventilation during the day would not provide any cooling.

eQuest, TAS and IES, I know can model natural ventilation. In IES and
TAS you can actually model the operation of the windows by defining
limits on indoor temperature, wind speeds etc. eQuest is a little more
basic where you can use a S-G function for infiltration which calculates
higher infiltration rates based on outside wind conditions. eQuest then
calculates if indoor temperatures will be kept between the indoor
temperatures based on the outside conditions. If yes than it will shut
off the mechanical system and calculate 0 energy for that hour.

 

Therefore in programs like IES and TAS you may be able to keep
conditions below the set point even if the outdoor temperatures are
hotter due to air movement etc. You may also want to come to an
agreement with the client to allow a slightly higher set point, however
you will need to also apply this to the baseline model. Otherwise for
LEED, you can't take account for the hours were naturally ventilation
doesn't provide comfort. Also note that the unmet load hours can be a
maximum of 300 hours so potentially you could take credit for 300 hours
for natural ventilation even if it is above the set point.

Message-ID: <73479D5FEA249F439C67F905FF4FF9F007FCEC2F@EXCH01.Horizon-Engineering.com>

Dear eQuest users, 

 

I am having some difficulty with a project I am working on, and I was
hoping I could receive some help or any information on a building a with
packaged single zone units with DX cooling and hot water coils for
heating, with a VFD to vary the supply flow (there are no VAV boxes in
the system, and the supply reacts to overall building pressure rather
than specific zonal needs determined by pressure sensors in the
ductwork).   There is no reheat in the system either.  

 

It is a LEED for schools project where the simulation of the proposed
model shows very high unmet loads for heating and the total energy
consumption for space heating is 199 MBTU which is unrealistically low
as compared to the baseline model space heating which is 6369 MBTU.  We
do not see many unmet hours in the control zone, but since the unit
supplies many zones, we are getting very high unmet heating hours in
non-control zone spaces.  We are seeing on the order of 4000-5000 hours
unmet in many zones.

Adam:

How do you vary flow for a VFD is you aren't varying flow?

And how do you get the air to 110?F if you are leaving the "hot deck" at 80?F?

What did you change in the proposed model over the base model?

An .INP and .PD2 file of each would be helpful.

Dear eQuest users, 
?
I am having some difficulty with a project I am working on, and I was hoping I 
could receive some help or any information on a building a with packaged single 
zone units with DX cooling and hot water coils for heating, with a VFD to vary 
the supply flow (there are no VAV boxes in the system, and the supply reacts to 
overall building pressure rather than specific zonal needs determined by 
pressure sensors in the ductwork). ??There is no reheat in the system either.? 

?
It is a LEED for schools project where the simulation of the proposed model 
shows very high unmet loads for heating and the total energy consumption for 
space heating is 199 MBTU which is unrealistically low as compared to the 
baseline model space heating which is 6369 MBTU.? We do not see many unmet hours 
in the control zone, but since the unit supplies many zones, we are getting very 
high unmet heating hours in non-control zone spaces.? We are seeing on the order 
of 4000-5000 hours unmet in many zones.
?
I have modeled the heating for all zones by specifying the 
Heat Source as hot water loop, 
The Zone Heat Source is not installed, as the design has no reheat. 
Zone entering maximum supply temperature is at 110 degrees. 
Hot deck max leaving temp is 80 degrees

Adam,

Potential issues with how you model the variable flow...

For sure, there is a problem with supply air temperature for heating. The following is from the Help File:

"Use of HEAT-SET-T for systems SZRH and PSZ is discouraged because it simply overrides the maximum leaving air temperature specified by MAX-SUPPLY-T".

You've set your MAX-SUPPLY-T at 110 F and your HEAT-SET-T at 80 F. You are heating with only 80 F.

Hello,

According to Table G3.1.1b,

"All conditioned spaces in the proposed design shall be simulated as both
being heated and cooled even if no heating or cooling is to be
installed......"

In this situation, how is the heating/cooling system modeled?

Any help would be great.

Thank you.

Dear John,



Have posted the proposed and the baseline case model on behalf of Adam, also
responding to your query about VFD, about varying the flows, do we need to
model a vav system?.. or I am not very familiar with this part as the specs
don?t show VAV terminal units, they have provided the VFD schedules. It
would really help if you could let us know how to to rectify the error. I
also went ahead and changed the hot deck temperature to default as suggested
by you and Demba. But it doesn?t seem to help much


Thanks for responding,


Kind Regards,


Vidya

Chris,

 

While you'll not be permitted to remove the cooling system for the
proposed building in the PRM analysis, you can design and operate the
building and systems as mixed-mode such that the cooling system never
runs. The catch is that you must use the same setpoints at any given
simulation time step for both proposed and baseline buildings. Thus, if
your mixed-mode control strategy would raise the cooling setpoint when
the outdoor ambient temperatures are elevated-e.g., to allow the
occupants to get whatever benefit they can from opening the windows,
stored cooling from thermal mass, etc.-you would need to use the same
reset strategy (i.e., tracking the OA temperature) for the cooling
control set points in the baseline building. Ultimately, the building
owner will then have to approve of the number of hours your model
indicates the building will operate with elevated cooling set points. 

 

Best,

Timothy

And how did you model the natural ventilation?

In summer when external temperatures are above the room setpoint natural
ventilation during the day would not provide any cooling.

I am currently doing a naturally ventilated building for LEED and I
believe that if the space is achieving indoor temperatures between the

energy is 0 for the proposed design. Any hours where natural ventilation
can't achieve indoor temperatures within the set points, a mechanical
system needs to be modeled even if there isn't one in the proposed
building. This helps keep the unmet hours within the requirements for
LEED.

All,

 

we regularly design and model buildings which rely in part on natural
ventilation as a source of free cooling. The issue we are often faced
with is how to capture this benefit when performing a LEED Appendix G
analysis. Appendix G states that all conditioned spaces must have BOTH
heating and cooling. We would like to remove mechanical coolig in the
proposed design building and thus gain benefit when comparing to the
mechanical cooling system in the reference baseline building.

 

Has anyone tackled this issue and come to a satisfactory resolution? 

 

Thanks for your help.

I get this error every once in a while, and it always has something to
do with the DWG file.  A bad block, or a bad pline, or something...

 

Sometimes just doing a purgeall works, but other times, I actually have
to start a new DWG, copy over JUST the boundary lines that I traced for
inputting into eQuest, and that works.

 

Good luck
