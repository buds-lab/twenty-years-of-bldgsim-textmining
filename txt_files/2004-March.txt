Peter,
Section 11.2.1 of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-1999 indicates DOE-2 (not limited
to DOE-2.1) and BLAST are qualified to be used as energy simulation
program. 

Thanks,

Can anyone help me in providing any information regarding ASHRAE
approving DOE 2.1 as an energy simulation tool? I know this might sound
strange, even many years after the predictor shootout and knowing that
90.1 uses DOE 2 for most of the energy simulation, but is it written in
blood anywhere.

Neither does the California Energy Commission say that for THEIR energy "air
shows". But yet Title 24 was BUILT on DOE-2. The "approved" commercial Title
24 compliance software program has a DOE-2 engine. But I don't believe there
is anything explicitly state within the CEC literature.

The ASHRAE Fundamentals books always speaks to programs within the text. But
I do not believe ASHRAE can actually indorse a particular product. They have
to allow "Captain's discretion".

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200403311648.AA4811718pd80000059311@gard.com>

Does anyone have any MS word macros that they would share for selecting
different output reports and printing them, or exporting some of the
tabular data to MS Excel?  Or opening some of the output directly in
excel? 

For instance you can get the monthly and annual summaries of the
electric and fuel in the CSV file, but for complex rate structures you
can't immediately turn that into dollar amounts, you'd have to import
something like the ES-F report to get at each electric block. 

The default graphs are nice, but let's say that you wanted to compare
your simulation results with some data that you had paper bills for an
SDG&E rate AT-TOU. 

Energy/billing comparisons seem to be the main reason I'd want to use
these things, although another possibility would be to construct tables
of SV-A data or to refresh the value of some other parameter that
changes based on modifications to your simulation - without opening and
formatting a 4 MB *.sim file.  I see 14 different output files in my
directory, but don't how I would get any information out of them except
for the *.sim, *.csv, and of course the text files. 

If anyone can point me in the direction of tools that might be out
there, or give me some strategy tips on how I might accomplish these
things in VBA I would really appreciate it. 

Thanks!

David

Fernando,

I am not sure about the problems you are having with drawing in the detailed
edit mode, but I would suggest that you use the wizard at least to outline
the floor and zones.  It is much easier.  Even several years ago, when I was
using Power DOE, I would start the project in eQUEST, just so I could
outline the building using the wizard.  Now, eQUEST 3 gives you much more
power to draw both the floor(s) and zones, even allowing import of an
AutoCAD drawing to trace.

To do the floor and zone, open eQUEST, new project via the wizard, choose
the Design Development Wizard, fill in (or not) whatever blanks you want in
the Project and Site Data, then choose Return to Navigator in the lower
right hand corner.  From the Project Navigator, click on Edit Selected
Shell.  Go to screen 2 and click on the drop down arrow for Footprint Shape
and select Custom, select Blank Slate, and OK.  This is also where you can
select an AutoCAD drawing if you have one.  Then outline your shape.  You
may want to go through the tutorial, but one important point is to create
your shapes in a counter clockwise direction.  You can do the same sort of
thing with zones from screen 2 of the wizard.  Be sure to complete the floor
first.  Any changes to the floor can mess with your already completed zones.

Try it, and if you still want to draw in detailed edit mode, let me know and
I will help you through it.  Or if you have any trouble with using eQUEST to
draw, I can probably there, also.

Good luck,

Mike

  Dear users:

  My name is Fernando, and I am a doctorate student in the university of
Valladolid, Spain.
  I followed your advice and change from powerdoe to e-quest, but now I have
some problems, that I'm sure that are easy to solve but I can't.

  First, as I am used to powerdoe, I prefer using the detailed data edit,
but first I must begin with the wizard and close it. Is there any way to
begin directly in detailed data edit?

  Second, when I try to create a polygon from scratch, I'm obligued to write
the first three vertex, I cannot use directly the editor with the *dwg
drawing.I have to create a polygon of three vertex and then modify it with
the *dwg drawing editor. I don't know if there is an alternative way to do
this. In the help document it is mentioned that there is an add/delete
vertex mode and a select shape mode, but I cannot find it, I only find them
in powerdoe.

  Third, when I create a construction from a layers input, I cannot see the
useful drawing of the construction thermal behaviour, instead it appears the
message "heat transfer graph goes here". I don't know if it is a downloading
error, a bug or that it is not developed yet.

  And last of all, when I create exterior walls, they don't appear in the 3d
figure until I close the program and reload the project. Strange, isn't it?

  Thank you very much.

We are hoping to use local Hawaiian Kiawe (same as Southern U.S.

Ideally this data would come from a recognized testing lab...

Dear colleagues,
 
In December 2003 we invited you to participate in an online survey on the
current use of daylight simulation tools during building design. Thanks to
your active participation, we collected 185 valid responses from 27
countries. Key findings were:

*	survey participants worked predominantly on offices and schools 
*	tools' complexity and insufficient documentation are weaknesses of
existing programs
*	self-training was the most common training method
*	tool usage is significantly higher during design development than
during schematic design
*	shading type and control are the most common design aspects
influenced by daylighting analysis
*	over 50% of selected tools were RADIANCE based 

Should you be interested in the results of the survey, you can download a
PDF file with the main findings from
<http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/survey.html>

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200403291747.AA4702671pd80000054813@gard.com>

Hi,

I am trying to calculate the coil load for sizing water loop heat pump
system using eQuest. It is a single storey office building 13,500 sq ft.

The problem I run into is that the space heating and cooling loads don't
seem to match the coil loads proportionally.

At the system level the maximum heating coil loads I see in the SS-B
report are abnormally high in January alone compared to Dec and Feb???
causing an abnormal design peak load for heating. The cooling loads
however seem to look more plausible over the space loads calculated in the
LS-A. In modeling this I have used a default Water Loop Heat Pump system
and attached it to a geo thermal exchange water loop. The only thing I
have changed at the zone level is the CFM outside air required per person
(15 CFM/person).

And correct me if I am wrong, but the coil loads should be of the scale
equal to space loads plus the effect of outside air CFM required (1.08 X
CFM X temp differential). I just want to know if that is what the SS-B
report shows. If not, then what is the best place to look for the coil
loads in order to pick a suitable system (water loop heat pump in this
case)?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200403261531.AA3103859pd80000049632@gard.com>

Peter,
 
I never tried this before, but after your other email explanation, it's
worth a try.
 
Unforturnately, VisualDOE only let's you specify one HVAC system per zone,
so you can't call the AHU VAV and add an 2 or 4 pipe induction terminal
unit, as your description sounds like it's an induction box.  What might
work is to define the AHU system as powered induction system, which then
allows you to define the AHU, i.e. variable speed.  Since you only have a
cooling coil, you might need to add a schedule to lock out any heating the
system might try to provide.  I also noticed that if you define the system
as ceiling induction, you can define the AHU as VAV.  Again, you may need to
lock out heating from the induction box.
 
The heating can be handled with the Zone Air tab.  Click baseboards to
represent the radiators and put in the inputs requested.
 
This is an oddball.  Let me know how you make out.

You can model the exhaust fans as the Return fan.  Set the MIN-OUTSIDE-AIR 
to 1.  To model VAV you need to set a MIN-CFM-SCHEDULE to match the 
behaviour of the fume hoods opening and closing (it is tricky to determine 
exactly this behavior).  This way you can attempt to capture any heat 
recovery available.

   I was wondering if one can tell us something about programs which can
handle double-skin glazed curtainwalls.
In particular, is DOE2.1 capable of handling buildings with such elements -
or do the assumptions on the internal heat transfer coefficient and other
features make it unsuitable for this particular application?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Chilled water loop and/or Chiller size
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200403251528.AA2811750pd80000047540@gard.com>


Hi,All,

I am doing a project with ONE central chiller and was letting eQuest
(DOE2.2) to auto-size the chiller capacity. What I found is that the chiller
is sized (from report PV-A) almost TWICE as large as the building system
peak load (from repoert SS-D). As a result, the chiller and chilled water
loop can never run at above 50% load (from report PS-D).

I tried to diagnose this problem just by building a 2-story office boiling
model (20,000 sqft each story) and used most of the eQuest defaults as
inputs, and ran under California climate zone 01 (coldest) and 13 (hottest).
Comparing the results seems indicating the chiller size does not change much
(about 800 kbtu/h) while the system load is about 380 Kbtu/h and 700 Kbtu/h
for the two climate.

Since the chiller is always running at very load part load, the electricity
consumption is not reasonable. If I choose to use two chillers, the sum of
the chiller capacities is still way larger than the system load. but one of
the chiller will almost not run throughout the year.

Can anybody tell me what's the problem here? Is there a keyword that's
important in calculating the chilled water loop size but not made explicit
by eQuest?


Thanks a lot!

  We do not use any front end, and deal with BDL code. I was just surprised to see no explanation of a "closed-twr" keyword in any of the manuals. It just does not look like there is a provision to account for spray water requirement, additional pumping energy, etc.

    Konstantin,

    What front end are you using to insulate you from having to deal with text at the BDL level?  Our office has been using Visual DOE for about 7 years now and the central plant editor allows you to specify a closed cooling tower.  Anyway, I did a quick sample run specifying a low efficiency (as noted by the high approach) closed tower and the BDL text the program wrote looks something like what I have below.  If your GUI front end doesn't allow a closed tower, you might have to roll up your sleeves and insert similar text into the input file.  Make sure to change parameters as appropriate.

    Good luck.

        Konstantin,

        I have become a big fan of the hourly output report capabilities of DOE-2 for presentation purposes, troubleshooting, and to handle situations such as yours where I'm not aware of how to approach the solution within DOE-2.

        You could probably run an hourly report to export systems tons load, CHW supply temperature, and any other variables you might need (CHW pump kW, condenser pump kW, lighting kW, etc.) and dump the 8760 hours of data into an Excel file.  Based on your CHW pump kW, you might want to add a column to account for pump heat to give you total cooling load seen by the chiller.

        Then you need to add 3 columns to calculate from the DOE chiller curve coefficients the multiplier for capacity based on CHW and CW temp. (I assume you have a good idea of the variation in river water temp. by season), multiplier for EIR based on the water temperatures, and EIR-FPLR.  The product of these three values should give you the hourly EIR.  Add another column so that based on the total tons cooling load, you can then calculate chiller kW from the hourly EIR.

        It might end up being a big spreadsheet, but it's really simple in concept to set up and should give you the results you desire.  If you'd like to discuss further, feel free to call me.

          Alec, thank you.

          Unfortunately I am using Doe2.1E, where I cannot schedule loop temperatures. BTW, is it possible to write a custom function to access the PLANT?  It does look like I can only use custom functions to modify computations in Loads and Systems. 
          Any ideas?

            Konstantin,
            Not 100% sure, but I think you should be able to schedule the loop temperature.  Create day/week/year schedules and input the appropriate variation in river water temp, use that for loop temp.

            I know you can do this for ground source loop temperature for a WLHP system, so it should be applicable to CW loop.

            just for fun:

      I have become a big fan of the hourly output report capabilities of DOE-2 for presentation purposes, troubleshooting, and to handle situations such as yours where I'm not aware of how to approach the solution within DOE-2.

      You could probably run an hourly report to export systems tons load, CHW supply temperature, and any other variables you might need (CHW pump kW, condenser pump kW, lighting kW, etc.) and dump the 8760 hours of data into an Excel file.  Based on your CHW pump kW, you might want to add a column to account for pump heat to give you total cooling load seen by the chiller.

      Then you need to add 3 columns to calculate from the DOE chiller curve coefficients the multiplier for capacity based on CHW and CW temp. (I assume you have a good idea of the variation in river water temp. by season), multiplier for EIR based on the water temperatures, and EIR-FPLR.  The product of these three values should give you the hourly EIR.  Add another column so that based on the total tons cooling load, you can then calculate chiller kW from the hourly EIR.

      It might end up being a big spreadsheet, but it's really simple in concept to set up and should give you the results you desire.  If you'd like to discuss further, feel free to call me.

        Alec, thank you.

        Unfortunately I am using Doe2.1E, where I cannot schedule loop temperatures. BTW, is it possible to write a custom function to access the PLANT?  It does look like I can only use custom functions to modify computations in Loads and Systems. 
        Any ideas?

          Konstantin,
          Not 100% sure, but I think you should be able to schedule the loop temperature.  Create day/week/year schedules and input the appropriate variation in river water temp, use that for loop temp.

          I know you can do this for ground source loop temperature for a WLHP system, so it should be applicable to CW loop.

          just for fun:

            Hello,

            I am working on a project that considers utilizing river water instead of a conventional cooling tower condenser water. Does anyone have an idea how could this be simulated in DOE2.1? (Basically, somehow I need to reset entering condenser water temperature to that of a river water).

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200403240851.AA5135390pd80000044604@gard.com>

Konstantin,
 
What front end are you using to insulate you from having to deal with text
at the BDL level?  Our office has been using Visual DOE for about 7 years
now and the central plant editor allows you to specify a closed cooling
tower.  Anyway, I did a quick sample run specifying a low efficiency (as
noted by the high approach) closed tower and the BDL text the program wrote
looks something like what I have below.  If your GUI front end doesn't allow
a closed tower, you might have to roll up your sleeves and insert similar
text into the input file.  Make sure to change parameters as appropriate.
 
Good luck.

Here are the books on my shelf concerning building energy 
simulation.  None of them address EnergyPlus directly but 
are more general.

Energy Simulation in Building Design, 2nd Edition
J. A. Clark, 2001
Published by Butterworth Heinemann 

Computerized Building Energy Simulation Handbook
James P. Waltz, 2000
Published by Fairmont Press

Building Energy and Environmental Modelling
Applications Manual AM11:1998
CIBSE (Charted Institute of Building Services Engineers)

HVAC2 Toolkit
Algorithms and Subroutines for Secondard HVAC System 
Calculations
Michael J. Brandemuehl, 1993
ASHRAE

The first two were purchased from Amazon if I remember 
correctly. 

This doesn't include many papers and manuals for specific 
simulation programs (DOE-2, Trace, etc...)

Hello Debra,
 
There are three ASHRAE references in your email.
ASHRAE Standard 90.1-1999 is the energy standard used to obtain Energy and Atmosphere credit 1, optimizing energy performance (and the related prerequisite)
ASHRAE Chapter 32 of the Handbook of Fundamentals is on Space Air Diffusion design to obtain IEQ credit 2, ventilation effectiveness - the design needs to comply with this chapter.
ASHRAE Standard 129 - Measuring Air Change Effectiveness is also to obtain IEQ credit 2, ventilation effectiveness - it defines the air change effectiveness.
 
Usually to meet IEQ credit 2, it requires either natural ventilation or displacement (underfloor air) systems.
 
You can order these books/standards at www.ashrae.org if you'd like.

A note to our business partners, due to recent e-mail server attacks
over the Internet and at The RMH Group, Inc. we will be implementing
"Reverse DNS" queries. Where DNS translates a fully qualified domain
name into an IP address that routers can use to get from Point-A to
Point-B. Reverse DNS allows a receiving mail server to go back to the
Authoritative DNS servers for a domain and verify that the host trying
to send mail actually exists at that domain and with the IP address
claimed by the sender. We suggest that you contact your IS department
and/or ISP to verify that your DNS zones are configured properly and
your e-mail servers have PTR records.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200403221112.AA125362pd80000040626@gard.com>

Hi Renee-

Regarding your question, I went through the same situation recently using VisualDOE (DOE2.1).
First with 100% OA, the return fan will act as the exhaust fan.  Since labs with fumehoods are typically
exhaust driven I sized the supply air cfm according to the fumehood capacity.  Usually a lab won't operate
with  fumehoods running at full capacity 24-7 and some assuptions have to made regarding a diversity factor.
I found two ways to implement this:
1 - alter the defined supply air amount to model a CV system 
2 - in the DOE2 input file add a schedule to min-cfm-ratio to alter the minimum damper position, but this gets a little tricky to get exactly what you want...

I have more experience in TRNSYS than DOE2 and I opted to go in that direction.
TRNSYS lets you define all of your system components and schedules.  This makes set-up a little more
complex, but the final product is exactly what you need...hopefully ;)

Has anyone modeled a VAV fume hood exhaust for a laboratory in eQuest? Since the laboratory requires 100% outside air, a return fan is not simulated obviously. The exhaust fan part on the air-handling unit fan page of eQuest doesn't seem to be able to be modeled. If I put the exhaust in each zone, then I can't specify that the fans are VAV. Please let me know if you have had luck with modeling this type of system in eQuest.
Thanks,

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Heat pumps in TRNSYS
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200403220519.AA1900578pd80000040225@gard.com>

Dear TRNSYS users,

for my my year-long simulation I need to use a air-water heat pump, whose role is to supply temperature (at 50 and 7?C in winter/summery operation) and flowrate to the type 673 fan coil. I have Standard TRNSYS and TESS Libraries but I don't understand which is the type that models the heat pump. 

1)    Maybe type 655 can simulate winter operation but I'm searching for a type that I can use to cool and heat the fluid and not only cool it.

2)     If I use type 655 I must supply 2 two external data files. The first data file contains ratios of the capacity to the rated capacity and the COP to the rated COP as functions of the chilled water set point temperature and the ambient temperature; the second file must contain the fraction of full-load power as a function of the part-load ratio on the machine. But for my heat pump I have only the data presented in the catalogue (ie rated cooling capacity, rated heating capacity, COP, total fluid flow rate... see in attachment)!!

I hope that someone can help me... whichever description in TESS libraries is absolutely devoid and I don't know how continue my work.

Hi Gerald,

There are two RADIANCE-based daylighting design programs that you can also
use to get annual daylight availabilities (daylight autonomy and daylight
factor) in New York City:

(1) Lightswitch Wizard: for a standard office you can do an online
simulation within a few minutes using via www.buidwiz.com

(2) DAYSIM: Should you be interested in doing an advanced daylighting
analysis for more complex geometries, you can download the DAYSIM software
(www.daysim.com)

Good luck,

Christoph

Unless you can predict exactly how the fume cupbards will be utilised, is there a need to model them as VAV?  I used DOE-2.2 a couple of years ago to look at a similar arrangement and we diversified the fume cupboards so that we effectively modelled a constant exhaust rate.  Set this up as a parameter and then run for different values to see how sensitive performane is to fume cupboard use / diversity ...

Gerald,

Why don't you use the TMY2 files, there are over 200 for the US and they
give you daylight availability for every hour of a "typical" year and
can be used in conjunction with a thermal simulation.  For more
information on the TMY2 data go to:

Hi Gerald,

You might be able to use the IDMP (International Daylight Measurement Program) data for calculating daylight availability. The program has several monitoring stations throughout the world(including two in US; Ann Arbor MI, and Albany NY) You can probably contact Dr. Richard Perez to get some real-time daylighting data from the Albany station. Check out http://idmp.entpe.fr/

Gerald,

Why don't you use the TMY2 files, there are over 200 for the US and they
give you daylight availability for every hour of a "typical" year and
can be used in conjunction with a thermal simulation.  For more
information on the TMY2 data go to:
http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/tmy2/

Hi All,
I have been trying to get hold of Daylight Availability curves for New
York, and in my extensive research, I haven't come across any material
or resource.
I came across a pdf on Lyon daylight availability and it look something
like a daylight percentage exceedance, but nothing more than that.
I would really appreciate if anyone has any information on how to get
hold of this, or if there is a template where I could use.
Your cooperation is appreciated.
Thanks,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200403191133.AA3328203pd80000036184@gard.com>

Smita,
Here are some steps to lead you to model GSHP system in eQuest:
1. Set up eQuest to Detailed Data Edit Mode
2. Go to Water-Side HVAC tab
3. At the left side of menu, right click Project,  then select Create
Circulation Loop. Use Water Loop Heat Pump type for GSHP system.
4. Go back to right click Project  again, select Create Ground Loop Heat
Exchanger, a window screen will pop up for all the detail design inputs
of GSHP system.

Tips: 
1. Download Ground Loop HP Curves from
http://www.doe2.com/download/eQUEST/
2. Make sure you have enough accurate GSHP system design data for your
eQuest modeling.  eQuest has no capability to autosize GSHP systems as
it does to other conventional HVAC systems.

Good Luck!

Bing

Has anyone modeled a VAV fume hood exhaust for a laboratory in eQuest? Since the laboratory requires 100% outside air, a return fan is not simulated obviously. The exhaust fan part on the air-handling unit fan page of eQuest doesn't seem to be able to be modeled. If I put the exhaust in each zone, then I can't specify that the fans are VAV. Please let me know if you have had luck with modeling this type of system in eQuest.

Hello,
 
I have an M+V question.
 
I am looking for a product line that would be suitable for submetering
electric demand for a large manufacturing facility.  There are several
buildings at the facility, each has its own main subpanel, but the only
utility meters are on the primary side of the site's transformer.  The
product I am looking for should be able to measure three-phase kW at each
subpanel and either save data locally for future downloading or send it over
a (wireless?) network to a computer for collection and analysis.  The
wireless network would be an added bonus to avoid long wire runs, but
another alternative might be to interface to the existing LAN or SCADA
system.
 
Any suggestions?  Mfgr's website links?
 
Oh yeah, it should be proven, inexpensive, and flexible too!  ;-)

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200403181118.AA1853562pd80000034215@gard.com>

Konstantin,
 
I have become a big fan of the hourly output report capabilities of DOE-2
for presentation purposes, troubleshooting, and to handle situations such as
yours where I'm not aware of how to approach the solution within DOE-2.
 
You could probably run an hourly report to export systems tons load, CHW
supply temperature, and any other variables you might need (CHW pump kW,
condenser pump kW, lighting kW, etc.) and dump the 8760 hours of data into
an Excel file.  Based on your CHW pump kW, you might want to add a column to
account for pump heat to give you total cooling load seen by the chiller.
 
Then you need to add 3 columns to calculate from the DOE chiller curve
coefficients the multiplier for capacity based on CHW and CW temp. (I assume
you have a good idea of the variation in river water temp. by season),
multiplier for EIR based on the water temperatures, and EIR-FPLR.  The
product of these three values should give you the hourly EIR.  Add another
column so that based on the total tons cooling load, you can then calculate
chiller kW from the hourly EIR.
 
It might end up being a big spreadsheet, but it's really simple in concept
to set up and should give you the results you desire.  If you'd like to
discuss further, feel free to call me.

Not 100% sure, but I think you should be able to schedule the loop
temperature.  Create day/week/year schedules and input the appropriate
variation in river water temp, use that for loop temp.
 
I know you can do this for ground source loop temperature for a WLHP system,
so it should be applicable to CW loop.

Hello,
 
I'm modeling loads on an underground space to see if we need cooling
during the summer.  Using the method outlined in the Building Energy
Simulation User news Vol. 23, No. 6, page 19
(http://gundog.lbl.gov/dirun/23n_d_1.pdf), I'm getting negative
fictitious R-values for some long short walls (Example: F2 = 0.78, A =
778ft^2, P = 156ft, Rus = 8.27).  Am I correct in reducing the R value
of my wall construction to meet the effective R-value?  It seems strange
to be reducing the R-value of a construction that is physically there.
I imagine the only real reason for this would have to be that the ground
temperature is actually lower near the surface than listed in the
weather file, but would this be true on a sunny afternoon?
 
 Thank you,

Hi, everyone,

I am now developing a cool roof calculation tool for a utility company. The tool should account for the impacts of roof R-value, reflectivity, infrared emissivity, local weather, and building type, etc. It should be able to calculate both peak demand and energy consumption introduced by roofs. The calculation procedure should be a simplified one so that it can be developed on an MS Excel basis.

I have reviewed some methods, but they have some limitations: only provide peak demand or energy consumption calculations, not including the impact of infrared emissivity, etc. I am wondering if any of you can give me some suggestions on the selection of a suitable manual method for cool roof calculations.

Many thanks!

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] EnergyPlus Workshop Announcement
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200403171008.AA0837890pd80000031933@gard.com>

(This announcement is being sent to a list of persons who had 
previously expressed interest in EnergyPlus training workshops and to 
several building simulation mailing lists.  My apologies if you 
receive this more than once.)   

Introduction to EnergyPlus for Experienced Modelers     

May 17-18, 2004, San Francisco, California, USA     
August 2-3, 2004, Boulder, Colorado, USA   

This workshop will introduce EnergyPlus to experienced modelers who 
are familiar with the basic concepts of energy simulation.  The 
course will cover the mechanics of using EnergyPlus with an emphasis 
on aspects of EnergyPlus that differ substantially from other common 
modeling tools (e.g., DOE-2 and BLAST), such as the use of a multiple 
time-step approach, the integrated simulation of loads, systems and 
plant, and defining fluid and air loops.  

For more details on the course outline, registration fees, and 
accommodations please see:  

http://www.gard.com/training.htm  

Details about future workshops will be posted on this website as 
plans are finalized.

grab bag--boiler part load, waterside economizers and fan coils, and
efficient monitors and pcsRe: Question 1. I don't think the default curve
has much value at all. It gives an input of 8.25% at no load, which would be
for jacket and off cycle stack losses. If boilers were really this
inefficient you'd see it in summer gas bills. However, it gets offset by the
default boiler operation in DOE2, which is to turn the boiler off when it
reaches no load, which is also inaccurate. I think you need to develop new
curves, and control the boilers as they actually operate (ie. they cycle off
but they don't turn off). But its really hard to find useful information on
boiler part load operation, as it relates to jacket loss and off cycle stack
loss. I'd be interested in anything you come up with.

  Subject: [bldg-sim] grab bag--boiler part load, waterside economizers and

  I've been saving up a few unrelated questions--any thoughts:

  1) The default boiler part load curve in DOE 2 drops off substantially at
minimum loads.  My understanding is that this is a reasonable reflection of
cast iron sectional boiler

  performance. (but not steel fire tube or condensing) However, I haven't
found a source to validate this.  Does anyone have information on real part
load performance for code level efficiency cast iron sectional boilers on
the market today?

  2) The ASHRAE 90.1 energy cost budget manual requires budget baseline
four-pipe fan coil systems to have waterside economizers.  The DOE 2.2
software doesn't appear to allow this with the fan coil system type.  Am I
missing something in the code, or does anyone have a work around or
approximation?

  3) I've heard various claims for energy savings for flat screen monitors,
and/or sleep-mode locally, or network controlled to reduced W/s.f. for
desktop computers, and more efficient PCs. It seems like nearly all monitors
now have a sleep mode of some sort.  Any comments on the baseline assumption
for these features, and how much savings an energy measure based on these
ideas can reasonably produce?

They list small (13-15"), med. (16-18") and large (19-20") computer monitors
at 55 W, 70 W and 80 W, respectively while in continuous operation and 0 W
while in energy saver mode. These values are likely for CRTs, not LCDs,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200403161121.AA2131390pd80000030050@gard.com>

SESG Introduction and Workshop on EnergyPlus
University of Strathclyde, 21-22 April 2004 

An overview of EnergyPlus
21 April 2004, M329 James Weir Building of the University 
of Strathclyde 75 Montrose Street, Glasgow G1 1XJ. 
Registration 9:00, session 9:30 am - 12 followed by a light lunch

IBPSA-Scotland, also known as the Scottish Energy Systems 
Group are organizing an EnergyPlus overview and workshop. 
The morning session is your chance to find out more about 
the EnergyPlus building energy simulation program, developed 
by the U. S. Department of Energy and which is under discussion 
for use as a UK compliance tool for the European Energy 
Performance of Buildings Directive. Dru Crawley, the programme 
manager and prime motive force for EnergyPlus at the DoE, will 
be presenting this overview and the workshop that will follow. 

If you are in professional practice and are curious about 
EnergyPlus and how its possible adoption might impact upon 
your company, the way you do business and how you interact 
with your clients, then this is your opportunity to hear 
from the source about current facilities and capabilities 
of EnergyPlus. This introduction and the workshop to follow 
will present the critical information you will need to allow 
you to decide how EnergyPlus might be integrated into your 
professional practice, the resources required to adapt your 
computational resources and working practices.  

This overview will also be of interest to policy makers and 
planners in local and regional governmental bodies who will 
be involved in the Energy Performance Directive and who need 
to find out the underlying capabilities of EnergyPlus to be 
in a better position to influence the details of the 
implementation of the directive if EnergyPlus is selected. 

The overview will also be of interest to those who have 
already begun to explore EnergyPlus and who are curious 
about features of the newest version, Version 1.2, (which 
will be released in early April 2004) such as:
* Calculation of environmental impacts (greenhouse and 
  precursor gases, criteria pollutants) from electricity 
  and fuel use
* Bi-directional daylight calculations using radiosity 
  for complex fenestration
* Displacement ventilation
* Latent capacity degradation on cooling coils
* Demand-controlled ventilation
* Building integrated PV and solar thermal systems
* HVAC system diagramming tool

A more complete list of features is available on the EnergyPlus 
web site:  www.energyplus.gov.

We expect this overview to be popular and seating is limited 
so please book early. The overview is free to all.



Hands-On EnergyPlus Workshop
21-22 April 2004 1:30 PM - 5:30 PM  (21st), 9:30-5:00 PM (22nd)

The objective of this course is to introduce EnergyPlus to 
those who are already familiar with the basic concepts of 
energy simulation. The course will cover the mechanics of 
using EnergyPlus with an emphasis on aspects of EnergyPlus 
such as multiple time-step approach, integrated simulation 
of loads, systems and plant, and defining fluid and air 
flow loops. It will discuss the basic techniques involved 
in applying simulation tools  appropriately during the 
building design process, for example, comparing two or 
more alternative systems.  Time will be set aside to allow 
participants to model basic building envelopes and systems 
using the latest version of EnergyPlus. Each session will 
include time for questions and answers. 

Session 1 - EnergyPlus Features and Benefits
Session 2 - Overview, Global Inputs, Outputs, and Auxiliary Tools
Session 3 - Defining a Building
Session 4 - Building Geometry and Internal Loads
Session 5 - HVAC Overview, Sizing Options, and Controls
Session 6 - HVAC Air-Side Equipment
Session 7 - HVAC Water-Side Loops
Session 8 - HVAC Water-Side Equipment, Auto-Sizing, and Templates
Session 9 - Support, Summary and Miscellaneous

The workshop is limited to 15 places. The workshop fee is 250 
Pounds for non-members and 175 Pounds for SESG members. A 
laptop computer will be required for all participants for 
use during the workshops. SESG will provide five machines 
(be sure to indicate whether you require one of these).  

Participants are expected to have the latest version of 
EnergyPlus (Version 1.1) installed on their laptop prior 
to arriving at the workshop. This is available for download 
from http://www.energyplus.gov/.  Participants will be 
informed of the availability of Version 1.2 prior to the course. 

Other software requirements include: Adobe Acrobat 5.0 or 
later to view PDF files, a text editor such as WordPad or 
Notepad to view example input files, a spreadsheet program 
to view CSV formatted output files, and Autodesk VoloView 
Express for viewing DXF files. If you require assistance 
in downloading any of the above please contact SESG prior 
to the event.

You won't find a report that tells you the actual OA heating and cooling 
loads - sensible and latent.  You need to calculate that yourself based on 
the outdoor air ratio at the peak heating/cooling times.

You can use hourly reports to help with this task.

Hi:

Outside ventilation air loads are excluded from the LS-C report in DOE
2. Is it reported in any other report - as it is usually a major % of
the total loads. Is it in any of the system reports? Latent / sensible
separated, etc...?

How does one read it in DOE 2? 

Thank you.

Subject: [bldg-sim] IBPSA-Scotland (SESG) announcement: TRNSYS introductory course, Glasgow 
 17-18 May
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200403150731.AA3109890pd80000027850@gard.com>


Solar Energy Systems and Building Simulation with TRNSYS
introductory course, May 17-18 2004, Glasgow,  Scotland

IBPSA-Scotland, also known as The Scottish Energy Systems 
Group (SESG), in conjunction with the Solar Energy Laboratory 
of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, are organizing a 
TRNSYS introductory course in Glasgow, Scotland on May 17-18, 
2004. The training course will use TRNSYS version 16, which 
is expected to be publicly released in May 2004.

Practical details and the course programme are given below 
or at http://www.sesg.strath.ac.uk.

What is TRNSYS?
TRNSYS (pronounced TRAN-Sys) is a modular simulation program 
used to model energy systems and buildings. Its main applications 
are: advanced buildings and HVAC systems, solar systems (thermal 
and photovoltaic systems), other renewable energy systems, 
cogeneration plants, fuel cells and Hydrogen systems.

TRNSYS has become reference software throughout the world. It 
is one of the listed simulation programs in the recent European 
Standards on solar thermal systems (ENV-12977-2). The level 
of detail of TRNSYS' building model, known as "Type 56", is 
compliant with the requirements of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 140-2001. 
The level of  detail of Type 56 also meets the general technical 
requirements of the European Directive on the Energy Performance 
of Buildings, which makes TRNSYS a potential candidate for 
compliance with the directive's implementations in various EU 
countries.

More detailed information is available on the TRNSYS website: 
http://sel.me.wisc.edu/trnsys/ and the SEL website
http://sel.me.wisc.edu .
TRNSYS actually consists of a suite of tools, from visual 
interfaces that allow users to input the required data for 
a simulation (building + systems) in a visual, user-friendly 
way to programs that allow you to create stand-alone applications 
that can present a simplified simulation to non-expert users. The 
training course will introduce users to the use of those tools in 
order to become quickly productive with the program.


Who is giving the course?
The course will be taught by Micha?l Kummert of SEL. Micha?l 
graduated as a Mechanical - Electrical Engineer at the Free 
University of Brussels. He obtained a PhD in Environmental 
Sciences at the FUL (Arlon, Belgium) studying optimal control 
of passive solar buildings. He has worked as a consulting 
engineer for 3E (Brussels), designing low-energy buildings 
and active solar systems. Since November 2001, he is the 
TRNSYS Coordinator at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
Solar Energy Lab. He contributes to the TRNSYS development 
and coordinates the developers team. He is also involved in 
user support and he contributes to the TRNSYS education 
programs. He has taught beginners and advanced TRNSYS courses 
in the US, France, Belgium, Spain and Korea.

Who is the course for?
Practitioners who are considering TRNSYS use will have ample 
opportunities to evaluate its facilities and ask questions. 
Those who have recently acquired TRNSYS will be avoiding the 
hassles and pitfalls of self instruction and users at all 
levels will learn how to use some of the new features in 
TRNSYS 16: improvements to the visual interface, better 
integration of the different tools, drop-in DLL's to add 
new components, etc.

The number of participants is limited so you are encouraged 
to register early.

The course fee (excluding accommodation) will be 400 Pounds. If 
the course if fully subscribed the first six SESG members 
will get a discounted fee of 275 Pounds. If there are fewer 
participants then fewer discounts will be offered. The number 
of participants is limited to a dozen.

What do I need to bring?
The course venue will provide a limited number of computers 
with relevant software. Participants will have the option to 
bring their own computers and a time-limited version of TRNSYS 
will be made available for use during the course. If you have 
details of a design you want to test, bring along details to 
support your explorations on the second day.

Vikram and Jason,

I had a similar electric rate structure on a past project.  I used a rate
schedule with each block having a flag value.  For example, in the schedule
below, first 200 hours would be block 1 (flag value = 1), next 200 hours
would be block 2 (flag value = 2), next 200 hours would be block 3 (flag
value = 3), over 600 hours would be block 4 (flag value = 4).  A 24/7 day =
"flag value" is needed for each block with a corresponding Week schedule.
The annual schedule would then break down each month as follows :

for any given month:
day 1 to day 8 Week 1 (200 hours/24 hours/day = 8.3 days, rounded to 8)
day 9 to day 17 Week 2 (400 hours/24 hours/day = 16.7 days, rounded to 17)
day 18 to day 25 Week 3 (600 hours/24 hours/day = 25 days)
day 26 to end of month Week 4

Setting up the annual schedule can get tedious but seemed to work when
checking by hand in the ES-E DOE2 report file.  The DOE2 help files
concerning utility rates have an example of how to use the flagged rate
schedule.

Be careful of the KWH/KW-LIMITSUM blocks - I have only had luck getting the
limitsum to work when the schedule reads "first 200 kwh/ billing kW" not
when limit is based on hours.

Good Luck,

Vikram,

Sounds like Georgia Power. I don't know exactly how to do 
this in DOE-2.2 but I know that it can be done in DOE-2.1e. 
If you look at Example 12 "Mixed Energy Block Types with 
Complex Demand Ratchets" on page 5.47 of the DOE-2.1e 
Supplement you will see this rate described (some of the 
numbers have changed since then).  

You will probably need to use the KWH/KW-LIMITSUM option. I 
think the only difference in DOE-2.2 is that the numbers in 
the block data are entered differently.

 Hi,
 A project I'm currently workinghas a slightly complicated electricity rate .  I have already tried breaking up the rates into 2 blocks - the first one is an energy block, and the next one is a kWh/Kw block, but it doesnt seem to go to the kwh/kw rate even when the ratio is over 200kwh/kw. Is there something I am missing, or is it just something that cant be modelled in eQUEST?

Thanks
 
Vikram Sami

I haven't used eQUEST but the OA-FROM--SYSTEM is in DOE2.1e.  You need to 
create a dummy space and zone.  Set the temperature to the average make-up 
air supply.  I don't know about eQUEST (DOE2.2) but it is next to 
impossible to get the make-up air system to simulate a variable flow to 
match what is happening in the systems it serves.  You might need to set a 
MIN-AIR-SCH and MIN-CFM-SCH to match what you think is happening in the 16 
VAV handlers.  You might need to run hourly reports to determine the amount 
of total OA required to match the 16 VAV systems.

Hello

Is anyone aware of building energy simulation packages with a friendly 3D modelling interface to perform integrated analysis of airflow (CFD), dynamic thermal, lighting/daylighting and solar ?
I've been using IES virtual environment and would like to compare it with other similar programmes that may be available on the market.

Thank you

Stergios,
 
If you are also doing energy simulation,  you might look at eQUEST (www.doe2.com).  The latest version has life cycle costing capability built in.

I posted this reply to the TRNSYS mailing list, but thought since it also 
came through BLDG-SIM that I would answer it here in case anyone was 
interested.

""Standard TRNSYS does not contain models for fan coil units (or even fun 
coil units) - unless you have decent catalog data in which case you could 
use the Type 42 catalog look-up routine.  TESS has a few fan coil models 
(2-pipe and 4-pipe with various combinations of controls and fan types) 
that will be released in Version 2 of the TESS HVAC library (for release 
with TRNSYS 16).  These could be made available earlier if needed.  Or you 
could certainly write your own model and add it to TRNSYS.  We also have a 
model for horizontal buried pipes available in the current TESS GHP library.

As for the arrangement of fan coils and buried pipes I would suggest you 
first do a literature search to see what others have tried.  Then use the 
modular nature of TRNSYS and try as many combinations as you can imagine - 
behold the power of flexibility.....

Let us know if you have any other questions.""

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Fun coil
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200403030930.AA3022500pd80000008862@gard.com>

Dear TRNSYS users,
I'm a new TRNSYS user and I have some problems to assemble the simulation of a multizone building with type 56. At the moment the project consist in:

- a type 9a to read the climatics data;
- a type 16e to estimate the radiation on vertical surfaces;
- a type 33e and a type 69b to calculate the fictive sky temperature;
- a type 56 multizone building;
- a type 501 to estimate the ground temperature used as an input in the type 56.

Now I must add:

1) a fun coil convenctional system for heating and cooling;
2) a hybrid system fun coil/buried horizontal pipes.

Can help me to choose the just component for the fun coil? How I can arrange fun coil with buried horizontal pipes? 

Thanks a lot.

I would check with the California Energy Commission.  There was a study I 
just don't recall the title and would have to research where to get 
it.  Essentially Title 24 is 10% more stringent on average.

Chris,

This might not be the most elegant solution, but it should get you close.
Although I think you can define a waterside economizer/fluid cooler, I don't
think you can specify the sequencing by outdoor air temp., just by load or
season.

You could probably do a base case run with the air-cooled chillers and
create an hourly report with dry bulb, wet bulb temps., tons, chiller kW,
and pump kW.  Next, import this into an Excel spreadsheet.  Based on the
performance of your fluid coolers, you can probably zero out the chiller and
CHW pump kW of the air-cooled system for those hours below a certain wet
bulb temperature when free cooling is happening.  You'll need to add a few
columns to track the fan, condenser water pump, and perhaps different
chilled water pump kW of the fluid cooler system.  

The difference between the two should be your savings.  The problem is it's
a bit more tedious and you have to keep track of when the peak demands are
hit.

Hope this helps.

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] Air Cooled chiller with dry fluid cooler


I have been asked to model a chiller plant that consists of three air 
cooled chillers in parallel with two dry fluid coolers.  The fluid coolers 
will be used when outdoor temperatures permit "free cooling".  Any ideas on 
how to capture this free cooling with DOE2.1E?

Hi,

I have seen earlier posting on this subject but no responses, does anyone
know of a comparison document between ASHRAE 90.1 and Title 24?

Also, is there anyone who can please share the 90.1 library for use in
VisDOE.

Thanks a lot,
