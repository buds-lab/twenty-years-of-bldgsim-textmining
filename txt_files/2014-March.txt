Subject: [Bldg-sim] Need help in base case design for HVAC in Title 24 Rules
Message-ID: <1393664024.79085.YahooMailNeo@web165005.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Dear Sir/Madam,

?We are studying California Title 24 Rules for Non-Residential Buildings 
and we are not able to understand how the base case HVAC system is 
defined for the simulation under whole building performance approach of 
this book. 

During the study, we could not find any table similar to ASHRAE 90.1 
Appendix G where system type is defined based on the conditioned floor 
area and number of floors in the building.
Request you to guide us on the selection of HVAC system to create the 
base case of California Title 24 Rules for Non-Residential Buildings.


Thanks,Subhash

If you are just looking in the standard, you should find the "Nonresidential
Alternative Calculation Method (ACM) Approval Manual". This document
includes many of the modeling rules and baseline requirements for Title 24
compliance. HVAC systems are addressed in Section 2.5. Good luck!

Also please bear in mind that the NEW 2013 standards take effect on July 
1, 2014 (they were supposed to take effect on January 1, 2014, but this 
was delayed due to software problems so anything you try now is apt to 
be wrong).

The 2013 ACMs are available here: 
http://www.energy.ca.gov/title24/2013standards/implementation/documents/index.html

There are two manuals, residential and non-residential.

Once you see how it is laid out, you will have questions.  There is no 
single simple table.  You can post your questions to the list or send 
them to me.  I'll try to help.  There is also a "hotline" at 
title24 at energy.state.ca.us .  They will also answer questions for you.

The "hotline" is very good with knowledgeable people.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] TRAINING: DesignBuilder Simulation Training Days June
	2-6 Washington DC
Message-ID: <011401cf3727$9a8148d0$cf83da70$@naturalintelligence.us>

DesignBuilder is a state-of-the-art software tool for checking building energy, carbon, lighting and comfort performance. Developed to simplify the process of building simulation, DesignBuilder allows you to rapidly compare the function and performance of building designs and deliver results on time and on budget. 

The training will be run using the new version 4 of DesignBuilder and will cover many of the new and enhanced features such as the new geometric modeler with enhanced block geometry editing, the ability to mirror blocks, add individual surfaces, and produce cut-away/section visualizations.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days.

The course is organized so that architects, if they wish, could attend only the first 2-3 days while the last 2 days are more specifically oriented towards engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Dates: June 2-6, 2014

Location: American Institute of Architects, 1735 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20006-5292

Discounts are available for multiple company attendees booking 4 or more days.

Space is limited so we encourage early registration.

Additional course information and registration <http://designbuilderusa.com/training/designbuilder-simulation-training-days> .

Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use, most powerful graphical user interface to EnergyPlus available which includes ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G climate zone, constructions and baseline HVAC system templates.

Questions about the course may be sent to trainer at designbuilderusa.com

Two students have a background in marine sciences involving ocean 
platforms and are learning building energy modelling.

Is there a source for weather data that is generated from something like 
a buoy or something that would not have any wind-blocks or other land 
based influences?

I see there is data available on the EERE website for Kwajalein Atoll in 
Marshall Islands but Im not sure if there are any big differences 
between this data and a sole platform in the middle of the ocean.

Although the study is a purely a hypothetical exercise, close to Norway 
would be ideal!

The ISD (Integrated Surface Hourly Database) of archived weather station reports from 
around the world includes dozens of reports from buoys or oil platforms in various 
places.   I have tended to ignore the buoys, but have kept track of the oil platform 
weather reports.  For Norway, there are three oil platforms with sufficient data to create 
simulation-usable weather files:

013755,Gullfax(Platform),2013,Complete,628,NOR_GULLFAX(PLATFORM)_013755_13.zip,NOR,61.033,2.033,10,0.0

The raw data from ISD can be accessed at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/isd/index.php

If you want more information or help about processing the ISD, please send me an e-mail.

these types of glazing systems will help reduce EMF's from the exterior.  As such, they 'may' reduce cell phone wave lengths as well.  I have not come across any studies, but the physics says it is possible.

Building simulators community 
Does anybody know in average how much energy is consumed in gyms per sf ?
or where i can find this information by climate zones 
 
Thank you

I don't see how there could be any effect at all.  The wavelengths are 
totally incompatible.  Low-e coatings block the near-infrared radiation at 
wavelengths of 700 to 2400 nanometers.  Even at the ultraviolet end, the 
wavelengths are around 100 to 400 nanometers.  The 3G and 4G networks that 
cell phones use are way off from this.  Typically, cell phone wavelengths 
(at 0.8 to 2.4 Ghz, the RF portion of the spectrum) are about one foot long 
(or around 300 million nanometers) - not even in the same ball park.

An ex boss lived in a Passivhaus and he couldn't get signal in the middle
of London.

A triple glazed unit can be quite thick. There were also multiple layers of
foil faced insulation in the walls. The Passivhaus institut may have done
some research on this.

If low-e coating film is a conductor (even poor) it will shield
electro-magnetic waves. The better conductor is the better shield.  Some
type of coating uses metal-oxide, which could be conducting.

Larry,

I'm not ready to dismiss this effect totally. When I look at a plot of Low-E 
transmissivity, it's shown to block anything from 800 nanometers on up, although the plot 
stops at 2400 (see 
http://www.leyboldoptics.com/cms/upload/downloads/S_Low_E_Coating_Apollon.pdf page 2).  
Out of curiosity, I did a Google Search for "Low-E windows block cell phone signals"  and 
found this question raised in various web pages.  Expanding on what I had said previously, 
I do know of a building in Beijing (China Academy of Building Research) that did a facade 
retrofit a few years back, after which the staff reported they could no longer get cell 
phone signals.  I think I'll send my colleagues an e-mail to ask for more details.

Dear all,

My colleague, expert in low-e coating, told me that silver-based low-e coatings (most of the soft low-e coatings use Silver) will reflect most of the radio frequency waves. Indeed,  almost all of the radio power is reflected within the first few atoms of the metal material.

Hi All,

Regarding the requirement for energy recovery in high rise residential buildings following ASHRAE 90.1-2010, section 6.5.6.1,  I want to analyze the difference between a pressurized corridor system vs. in-suite ERV system, and get your opinions.

My building is in CZ 6A, and following this I would need energy recovery on a fan system if my design were greater than 80% fresh air, and greater than 0 cfm (i.e. any amount), down to greater than 5500 cfm and 30%-40% fresh air, per Table 6.5.6.1.

In a pressurized system, it is certainly feasible that these thresholds will be exceeded due to the high amount of air pumped into the corridors, at 100% OA.  However, you can get around this with exception 6.5.6.1h - the largest exhaust source is far less than 75% of the fan system design OA rate. In this case, that would be the central corridor fan, which is serving both the corridors and suites, and the exhaust would be the individual WC fans in suite.  Diagnosis - no ERVs needed.

In an in-suite ERV system, again the Table 6.5.6.1 thresholds will likely be exceeded , since any amount of flow will need heat recovery if it is more than 80% fresh air. In this case, each individual ERV is its own fan system, again at 100% OA.  The corridor system is compartmentalized from this, and again can be exempt per 6.5.6.1h, as there would be multiple exhaust sources.  In suite, however, the ERV supply and exhaust are balanced, and very likely within 75% of each other, so the exemption no longer applies. Diagnosis - ERVs not needed for corridors, but needed for suites. In other words, once an in-suite ERV strategy is designed, you are penalized for it.

However, if you include the terminal fancoil/heat pump flow when considering table 6.5.6.1, the % OA would likely drop below 30%, and therefore heat recovery is no longer needed. Is it appropriate to consider the terminal device flow here - be it either in series or parallel with the ERV?

Your thoughts are appreciated. Are there any other interpretations for this out there?

My interpretation, and the way the way I have seen this interpreted in the past, is the systems air flow rate should include terminal fan coil/heat pump flow rates as well, because this is part of the "system".

I would also appreciate any other interpretations.

Thanks Ian,

As I was writing I convinced myself of the same conclusion based on that wording, but thought I would still put it out there to see if anyone has come across a different interpretation.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Increased Ventilation Credit and Energy Modeling
Message-ID: <0EA9E4A184B01D468EA29CEFC03EA58F8DCE80@SBS1.DesignEngineersPC.local>

Good day,

I have a question regarding the LEED credit for Increased Ventilation (IEQc2).  This is the credit awarded for exceeding ventilation in all spaces by 30% beyond the ASHRAE standard 62.1 requirements.  It seems obvious that the design model ventilation rates would be those 30% higher than 62.1 requirements.  What then would the baseline model ventilation rates be?

If you strictly follow 90.1 Appendix G, you should always model baseline and proposed equivalent except for when taking credit for demand controlled ventilation.  However, it seems in this case that it could also be argued (by LEED) that you should model the ASHRAE 62.1 required ventilation rates in the baseline model, not those that are 30% higher and therefore pay the energy expense( most climates) for increased outside air.

Does anyone have any experience with LEED on this issue?  Thanks in advance.

Kind regards,
Joe Chappell

There has been lots of discussion and misinformation about this in the
past.  I believe the current take on this from a LEED perspective is that
for each space in the proposed design where ventilation is above the
required minimum AND there is demand controlled ventilation, the equivalent
space in the baseline design shall be modeled with the minimum required
ventilation as per ASHRAE 62.1.  For all other cases, baseline ventilation
rates should match the proposed ventilation rates, regardless of whether
the proposed design uses an increased ventilation rate or not.

Message-ID: <C4B3436E467E7447A5712837ED007A8431C022FB@MAIL.mdaengr.com>

I have an old LEED v2.2 project using 90.1-2004.  The project has heat pump hot gas reheat dehumidification of a dedicated outside air stream (not dehumidifying the space, just the ventilation air).

I can't find anything in 90.1-G that says how to model dehumidification in the baseline.  The baseline units are constant volume DX with natural gas heat.  Even though a DOAS is not required, could I show a baseline model DX DOAS unit appropriately configured for Appendix G with natural gas reheat for dehumidification in order to show savings?  I'm using Trace and am not sure how to show dehumidification of an air stream but not the entire space, but that is another matter.

Any hints or direction is appreciated.

I have to agree with Karen on this.  For LEED modeling at least, you can model the ventilation rates the same even if they are above 62.1 minimums.  I would add though that you could apply Addendum bj to 90.1-2007 which add an exception to this for ventilation systems that improve air distribution effectiveness (primarily displacement ventilation systems).  I'm not sure if USGBC has ruled on this specifically but they generally allow one to adopt 90.1 addenda as long as you state which ones you're using.

I believe the current take on this from a LEED perspective is that for each space in the proposed design where ventilation is above the required minimum AND there is demand controlled ventilation, the equivalent space in the baseline design shall be modeled with the minimum required ventilation as per ASHRAE 62.1.  For all other cases, baseline ventilation rates should match the proposed ventilation rates, regardless of whether the proposed design uses an increased ventilation rate or not.

If you strictly follow 90.1 Appendix G, you should always model baseline and proposed equivalent except for when taking credit for demand controlled ventilation.  However, it seems in this case that it could also be argued (by LEED) that you should model the ASHRAE 62.1 required ventilation rates in the baseline model, not those that are 30% higher and therefore pay the energy expense( most climates) for increased outside air.

Does anyone have any experience with LEED on this issue?  Thanks in advance.

Worth noting that if you are modeling for LEED for Homes Midrise projects, you follow the modified version of Appendix G that appears in the ENERGY STAR Multifamily High Rise Simulation Guidelines, which puts a cap on your baseline ventilation flow rates of no more than 150% of 62.2.

The GBCI approach seems to be aimed at keeping people from gaming the system, more than suggesting designers stick to the 62.1 minimum. Don't add a bunch of extra OA to get the LEED credit, and then claim energy credit from DCV...

One point to contrast to this is that sometimes local codes, guidelines, or even client design standards might have rates higher than ASHRAE 62.1. In this case 90.1 can't contradict the designer's responsibility, and the baseline should have the identical outside air requirement, even if it is higher than ASHRAE 62.1.

62.1 is still a standard that sets the minimum ventilation rates.

As several others have noted there are specific conditions if DCV is used as a strategy to reduce outside air that might override the baseline OA quantity in some of those cases. It would also make sense to me that the baseline could be required to have an identical DCV system in that case and keep the rates the same, but I've never seen that as an official recommendation.

Dear (practicing) colleagues,

It would be wonderful if you decided to participate in a brief online survey on current practices for model setup and data management in building energy simulation. The survey is administered by the Sustainable Design Lab at MIT and the results will support an ongoing research project on building simulation assumptions used in practice, focusing specifically on material and construction properties, usage schedules, and building systems. Focus participants are practicing building energy modelers within architecture, engineering or sustainability consultancy firms, working at any design stage or capacity including schematic design, load calculations and complete compliance documentation.
If you fall into any of these categories, we would like you to fill out an online questionnaire about your day-to-day energy modeling practice. The questionnaire consists of 9 to 12 questions and should take no longer than 5 to 7 minutes to complete. Please respond to all questions as openly and honestly as possible. There is no right or wrong answer; it is only your opinions that are important. All of the information that we obtain from you through this survey will be kept confidential and your participation in this research is voluntary. Should you decide to participate in the survey, you still reserve the right to end your participation at any time and for any reason, without prejudice.
If you are interested in participating in this survey, please go to: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MITsimdatasurvey
Should you have any questions or suggestions, please contact Carlos Cerezo Davila at ccerezod at mit.edu<mailto:ccerezod at mit.edu>.
Thank you for your consideration,
Christoph and Carlos

Jim,

In my understanding the increased ventilation LEED point was created in
response to a deduction in the required ventilation rates by ASHRAE between
versions of 62.1. The confusion around how this affected the energy credit
came later.

I have to say:

?         I have not followed the GBCI closely on this topic,

?         But it seems like the credit was created to "compare and
contrast" the benefits of increased IEQ against the known energy penalty.

?         If that's true, then the Baseline should be per 62.1 and Proposed
at 1305 of the Baseline.

There has been lots of discussion and misinformation about this in the
past.  I believe the current take on this from a LEED perspective is that
for each space in the proposed design where ventilation is above the
required minimum AND there is demand controlled ventilation, the equivalent
space in the baseline design shall be modeled with the minimum required
ventilation as per ASHRAE 62.1.  For all other cases, baseline ventilation
rates should match the proposed ventilation rates, regardless of whether
the proposed design uses an increased ventilation rate or not.

Does anyone have any experience with LEED on this issue?  Thanks in advance.

Great comments all, and correct for LEED v3.

This is changing in the new LEED v4. It references ASHRAE 90.1 2010 which
does *not *match the baseline Ventilation rate to a proposed design that
exceeds the rates set by the rating authority or building official.

This matches Jim's comments - a high ventilation rate will be penalized
under LEED v4, since the baseline is the minimum, and the proposed matches
the higher value of the design.

Cheers,
Alex

Greetings all!
I am attempting to optimize the passive design of a building using GenOpt as the optimizer, EnergyPlus as the primary energy model platform, and daylight reports from Daysim (an identical model to the Eplus model) which feed into the Eplus model.Each iteration dictated by GenOpt would need to simulate in Daysim and finish before simulating in Eplus.I am using a 'Master' batch file, referenced by GenOpt, to call Daysim and then Eplus.This process works when run straight from the batch file, but when run through GenOpt it does not create the temporary working directory correctly (.expidf and .err files missing), and so it crashes during the first iteration, saying ".err file does not exist".Simplifying the task to just optimize Eplus, but through a batch file, has the same result.The command line I've been working with consists of 3 parts: Call <RunEplus.bat> <model> <weatherfile>I've tried countless different variations of this command line but cant figure it out!
Has anyone optimized an EnergyPlus model through GenOpt using a batch file before? Or know what the command line might look like to do that?
Any ideas welcome!
Thanks,Tavis.

Hello Tavis,

Khaled Nassar presented in 2012 at the Radiance Workshop a process for  
optimization of a Radiance model using GenOpt that references a batch  
file. It might be useful to you.

Look at RunDirMulti.bat that comes with EnergyPlus (in the main 
EnergyPlus folder).  It loops through a list of files and creates 
separate temp directories for a series of parallel runs.  You should be 
able to borrow from this or adapt it to your purposes.

Hi Tavis,

The lines below are from the "EnergyPlusWinXP.cfg" file that comes with GenOpt. Apparently GenOpt does use a batch file (customized RunEPlus.bat) to run E+. I think your best approach would be to modify the RunEPlus.bat file (or the RunEPlusParallel.bat file in GenOpt), and insert the part that runs DaySim in the same way that the other E+ preparatory steps are done...

**
/*  Specifying how to start the simulation program.
    In "Command", only those words in %xx% are
    replaced (possibly with empty Strings).
*/
SimulationStart
{
    // The command line below calls a custom version of RunEPlus.bat.
    // This is needed to run multiple EnergyPlus simulations in parallel,
    // because the standard version writes files to the EnergyPlus program
    // directory, and hence multiple simulations would access the same files.
    Command = "cmd /x /c \"start /D\"%Simulation.Files.Input.Path1%\" /WAIT /MIN call \".\\RunEPlusParallel.bat\" %Simulation.Files.Input.File1% %Simulation.CallParameter.Suffix%\"";
    WriteInputFileExtension = false;
}
**

Cheers,

Yi

Message-ID: <sjnbwh16cqaq7vson69wkqx8.1394837311150@email.android.com>

Dear BLDG-SIM community:

I'm working on energy savings calcs for a project that would use water from the Chicago River for a waterside economizer, via a heat exchanger.

Does anyone know if there are records of water temperature for the Chicago River?  If not the river, what about Lake Michigan as a proxy?  Hourly would be nice, but monthly would work.

And for the record, since it's almost St Patrick's Day, I don't think green dye affects the thermal properties of the river.  ;)

A million years ago, I did a study on the Palmer House. I recall winter time tap water being 44 degF. I also recall, as a Chicago boy, measuring summer tap water at 74 degF. But nothing monthly.

Hi, Thank you for your replies!

Alstan,
Yes, Khaled's tutorial for GenOpt + Radiance has been very helpful. I think the same input file structure could be used, plus the Daysim Header file.

Mike, 
This RunDirMulti.bat looks like it would be used to simulate a batch of pre-made EnergyPlus models in parallel, is this right? Or does it enable 1 model to run subsequent iterations? I need one iteration to finish before the next starts, so GenOpt can make its systematic changes to the model.

Yi,
I've tried copy pasting the Daysim batch file command lines in at the start of the RunEplus.bat so that it runs and completes before the Eplus model. This appears to work when run from the command shell, but, again, not when attempted through GenOpt. I think it comes back to Eplus and GenOpt- not creating temporary directories properly when called through a batch file (even following the command lines from GenOpts example files)?

Best regards,
Tavis.

Bldg-sim folks,

We at Autodesk are gathering some feedback on building performance analysis workflows. The intent of this survey is to start a dialogue around product development with a community of users. An area of interest is how modeling and analysis work together in your design process/ workflow, specifically during the conceptual design phase.

Survey link<https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/3H7PMBV> - https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/3H7PMBV
Deadline: March 23

We will give $100 Amazon gift cards to five random survey respondents. The deadline for responding to get the gift cards is March 23 (one week left). The insights from this survey will go to the Autodesk BPA and Conceptual Design product development teams.

The members of this list represent some of the most sophisticated energy analysis users out there. Your feedback is very valuable.

Thanks,
- Adam

Hi Tavis,



The lines below are from the "EnergyPlusWinXP.cfg" file that comes with GenOpt. Apparently GenOpt does use a batch file (customized RunEPlus.bat) to run E+. I think your best approach would be to modify the RunEPlus.bat file (or the RunEPlusParallel.bat file in GenOpt), and insert the part that runs DaySim in the same way that the other E+ preparatory steps are done...



**

/*  Specifying how to start the simulation program.

    In "Command", only those words in %xx% are

    replaced (possibly with empty Strings).

*/

SimulationStart

{

    // The command line below calls a custom version of RunEPlus.bat.

    // This is needed to run multiple EnergyPlus simulations in parallel,

    // because the standard version writes files to the EnergyPlus program

    // directory, and hence multiple simulations would access the same files.

    Command = "cmd /x /c \"start /D\"%Simulation.Files.Input.Path1%\" /WAIT /MIN call \".\\RunEPlusParallel.bat\" %Simulation.Files.Input.File1% %Simulation.CallParameter.Suffix%\"";

    WriteInputFileExtension = false;

}

**



Cheers,



Yi

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Coupling GenOpt, Energyplus and Daysim



Greetings all!



I am attempting to optimize the passive design of a building using GenOpt as the optimizer, EnergyPlus as the primary energy model platform, and daylight reports from Daysim (an identical model to the Eplus model) which feed into the Eplus model.

Each iteration dictated by GenOpt would need to simulate in Daysim and finish before simulating in Eplus.

I am using a 'Master' batch file, referenced by GenOpt, to call Daysim and then Eplus.

This process works when run straight from the batch file, but when run through GenOpt it does not create the temporary working directory correctly (.expidf and .err files missing), and so it crashes during the first iteration, saying ".err file does not exist".

Simplifying the task to just optimize Eplus, but through a batch file, has the same result.

The command line I've been working with consists of 3 parts:

Call <RunEplus.bat> <model> <weatherfile>

I've tried countless different variations of this command line but cant figure it out!



Has anyone optimized an EnergyPlus model through GenOpt using a batch file before? Or know what the command line might look like to do that?



Any ideas welcome!



Thanks,

Tavis.

Hi Yi,

Very mysterious! Yip I've attached the two .cfg file I've tried (one based on the Eplus.cfg example file; the other based on the batchSimulation.cfg file), and the Master.bat file with the various command lines I've tried (as a word doc- email wouldn't allow to send .bat).
And the .ini and command.txt if that helps.

Thank you for your interest and help!

Best regards,
Tavis.

Hi, Thank you for your replies!



Alstan,

Yes, Khaled's tutorial for GenOpt + Radiance has been very helpful. I think the same input file structure could be used, plus the Daysim Header file.



Mike, 

This RunDirMulti.bat looks like it would be used to simulate a batch of pre-made EnergyPlus models in parallel, is this right? Or does it enable 1 model to run subsequent iterations? I need one iteration to finish before the next starts, so GenOpt can make
 its systematic changes to the model.



Yi,

I've tried copy pasting the Daysim batch file command lines in at the start of the RunEplus.bat so that it runs and completes before the Eplus model. This appears to work when run from the command shell, but, again, not when attempted through GenOpt. I think
 it comes back to Eplus and GenOpt- not creating temporary directories properly when called through a batch file (even following the command lines from GenOpts example files)?






Best regards,

Tavis.

The problem is from wrapping the EPlusRun.bat in another batch file. Try use the third command-line in "IntegrateDaysim_EnergyPlus-7-2-0-Win7.cfg", i.e.

Command = "cmd /C \"\"D:\\MBSc500\\GenOpt\\IntegrateDaysim\\IntegrateDaysim_Master.bat\" \"%Simulation.Files.Input.File1%\" \"%Simulation.CallParameter.Suffix%\"\"";

And then change the call line in IntegrateDaysim_Master.bat to:

call "D:\MBSc500\GenOpt\IntegrateDaysim\RunEPlus.bat" %1 %2

And see if it works.

Yi,

No luck, the same error came up. 
I'm pretty new at this scripting business but as I understand it, the %1 and %2 are variables that the 'IntegrateDaysim_Master.bat' will substitute- the %1 for the model specified in the .cfg file (ChMod3.idf), and the %2 for the weather file specified in the .cfg. Is this correct?

Sebastian,

In the EE4 Modeling guide under Built-Up VAV, they state that you have the
option to choose between Series VAV Terminal and Parallel VAV Terminal but
that is greyed out in EE4.  With that being said I'm not sure what the best
way to model the system is if you stay in EE4 - you would need to account
for the intermittent terminal fan power somehow.

>From what I can tell in the DOE-2 basics guide you should model this type of
system as a Powered Induction Unit (PIU) which doesn't appear to be
available in EE4 so you would need to modify the .doe file in a text editor
and run the simulation outside of EE4.  Refer to the attached.

Regards,
Aaron

Hi all,

I'm trying to model a VAV system with parallel fan powers boxes at the zone
level. Is there a workaround to of this in EE4?

Thanks,

%1 and %2 represents the two arguments passed to IntegrateDaysim_Master.bat. For E+ simulation they are the idf the epw file names. I've tried a wrapper batch file by modifying one of GenOpt's examples; and it worked fine. Here are my modifications:

== wraprun.bat in C:\GenOptV3-1-0\example\energyplus\7_2_0\GPSHookeJeeves\ ==
call C:/EnergyPlusV7-2-0-64/RunEPlus.bat %1 %2

== EnergyPlus-7-2-0-Win7.cfg in C:\GenOptV3-1-0\cfg\ ==
...
SimulationStart
{
                // The command line below calls RunEPlus.bat.
                Command = "cmd /C \"C:/GenOptV3-1-0/example/energyplus/7_2_0/GPSHookeJeeves/wraprun.bat %Simulation.Files.Input.File1% %Simulation.CallParameter.Suffix%\"";
                WriteInputFileExtension = false;
}

== optWin7.ini in C:\GenOptV3-1-0\example\energyplus\7_2_0\GPSHookeJeeves\ ==
...
    Configuration {
      File1 = "..\\..\\..\\..\\cfg\\EnergyPlus-7-2-0-Win7.cfg";
}
...


Your problem may now come from moving RunEPlus.bat out of the E+ folder...

Yi,

No luck, the same error came up.
I'm pretty new at this scripting business but as I understand it, the %1 and %2 are variables that the 'IntegrateDaysim_Master.bat' will substitute- the %1 for the model specified in the .cfg file (ChMod3.idf), and the %2 for the weather file specified in the .cfg. Is this correct?

The problem is from wrapping the EPlusRun.bat in another batch file. Try use the third command-line in "IntegrateDaysim_EnergyPlus-7-2-0-Win7.cfg", i.e.

Command = "cmd /C \"\"D:\\MBSc500\\GenOpt\\IntegrateDaysim\\IntegrateDaysim_Master.bat\" \"%Simulation.Files.Input.File1%\" \"%Simulation.CallParameter.Suffix%\"\"";

And then change the call line in IntegrateDaysim_Master.bat to:

call "D:\MBSc500\GenOpt\IntegrateDaysim\RunEPlus.bat" %1 %2

And see if it works.

Cheers,

Hi Yi,

Very mysterious! Yip I've attached the two .cfg file I've tried (one based on the Eplus.cfg example file; the other based on the batchSimulation.cfg file), and the Master.bat file with the various command lines I've tried (as a word doc- email wouldn't allow to send .bat).
And the .ini and command.txt if that helps.

Thank you for your interest and help!

Best regards,

Hi Tavis,

Hmm, that's mysterious. Do you share your batch file(s) with the group? I cannot see any problems from Java's (GenOpt's language) point of view...

Hi, Thank you for your replies!

Alstan,
Yes, Khaled's tutorial for GenOpt + Radiance has been very helpful. I think the same input file structure could be used, plus the Daysim Header file.

Mike,
This RunDirMulti.bat looks like it would be used to simulate a batch of pre-made EnergyPlus models in parallel, is this right? Or does it enable 1 model to run subsequent iterations? I need one iteration to finish before the next starts, so GenOpt can make its systematic changes to the model.

Yi,
I've tried copy pasting the Daysim batch file command lines in at the start of the RunEplus.bat so that it runs and completes before the Eplus model. This appears to work when run from the command shell, but, again, not when attempted through GenOpt. I think it comes back to Eplus and GenOpt- not creating temporary directories properly when called through a batch file (even following the command lines from GenOpts example files)?


Best regards,
Tavis.

Hi Tavis,

The lines below are from the "EnergyPlusWinXP.cfg" file that comes with GenOpt. Apparently GenOpt does use a batch file (customized RunEPlus.bat) to run E+. I think your best approach would be to modify the RunEPlus.bat file (or the RunEPlusParallel.bat file in GenOpt), and insert the part that runs DaySim in the same way that the other E+ preparatory steps are done...

**
/*  Specifying how to start the simulation program.
    In "Command", only those words in %xx% are
    replaced (possibly with empty Strings).
*/
SimulationStart
{
    // The command line below calls a custom version of RunEPlus.bat.
    // This is needed to run multiple EnergyPlus simulations in parallel,
    // because the standard version writes files to the EnergyPlus program
    // directory, and hence multiple simulations would access the same files.
    Command = "cmd /x /c \"start /D\"%Simulation.Files.Input.Path1%\" /WAIT /MIN call \".\\RunEPlusParallel.bat\" %Simulation.Files.Input.File1% %Simulation.CallParameter.Suffix%\"";
    WriteInputFileExtension = false;
}
**

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Coupling GenOpt, Energyplus and Daysim

Greetings all!

I am attempting to optimize the passive design of a building using GenOpt as the optimizer, EnergyPlus as the primary energy model platform, and daylight reports from Daysim (an identical model to the Eplus model) which feed into the Eplus model.
Each iteration dictated by GenOpt would need to simulate in Daysim and finish before simulating in Eplus.
I am using a 'Master' batch file, referenced by GenOpt, to call Daysim and then Eplus.
This process works when run straight from the batch file, but when run through GenOpt it does not create the temporary working directory correctly (.expidf and .err files missing), and so it crashes during the first iteration, saying ".err file does not exist".
Simplifying the task to just optimize Eplus, but through a batch file, has the same result.
The command line I've been working with consists of 3 parts:
Call <RunEplus.bat> <model> <weatherfile>
I've tried countless different variations of this command line but cant figure it out!

Has anyone optimized an EnergyPlus model through GenOpt using a batch file before? Or know what the command line might look like to do that?

Any ideas welcome!

Thanks,
Tavis.

Hi all,

I'm looking for some guidance on estimating cafeteria kitchen energy usage for a high school. Are there any ballpark energy use per square foot values that I could use as the kitchen has not been designed yet? The school is located in a remote area of Canada and it will be powered by a fuel oil boiler. We need to get a sense of the overall energy consumption to start the preliminary sizing of the fuel storage tanks and generators.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Jeetendra,

I would suggest that you actually model the night flushing (whether this is flushing the occupied space or a thermal mass like TermoDeck hollow-core slab), as the performance and limits to this approach will be specific to the climate and the particulars of the design, including thermal mass, airflow rates, control strategies, etc.  In doing so, you'll want to use thermal comfort requirements, such as operative temperature at the beginning of the occupied hours, to limit the night flushing. In other words, it's important to avoid overcooling the space or taking credit for night flushing that does so, as this will tend to be offset by heating (in the model, actual use, or both). Also, be sure to fully account for fan energy in your model. If the night flushing must drive air through a convoluted path, you will need to account for the pressure the fan needs to overcome in doing so. If, on the other hand, you're using natural ventilation for night flushing, then you'll need to prepare an appropriate model of that using a bulk-airflow network or similar approach with suitable wind pressure coefficients,  description of operable openings, control of those openings, and pressure/buoyancy driven inter-zonal airflows. If mixed-mode, you really need to include both in the same model to understand the interactions.

Cheers,
Timothy

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Existing Envelope for LEED v3
Message-ID: <BLU169-W15B0153145A3DA3B7B7BD8C6790@phx.gbl>

Any help regarding the reuse of an existing building LEED simulation would be helpful. We are working on an existing building that was a warehouse and is now an office building. The existing shell was un-insulated concrete block walls and an un-insulated metal roof with metal joists. Using the ASHRAE 90.1 guidelines for envelope allows the use of existing envelope, but in the climate zone at-hand our proposed envelope alone represents a 30% energy cost savings. Our question is whether there is an exception or limitation to using existing the envelope if a building use is changed, ours is now an office.

Thanks,
 
Ken

Hi Ken,

Attached is  thread from 9 months back where I reported being corrected to use actual envelope constructions for 3 consecutive projects (reviewed simultaneously), and also to remove baseline rotations.

My understanding since then hasn't altered, though I'm uncertain whether this is spelled out anywhere explicitly with regard to LEED's review policies:  If your building's footprint isn't changing by more than 50%, for modeling purposes at least the project is classified a "retrofit" rather than new construction, and so the guidance/requirements become to match pre-existing envelope constructions for the baseline model (and to not rotate), in accordance with Table G3.1 language on the point.   I haven't run into a similar LEED review scenario since that time however - would be great to hear any others' experiences that would reinforce (or refute) this understanding!
The following CIR (for LEED for homes) evokes the same Table G3.1 language that I think was cited for my case:

Of related interest: LEED at one point made the interpretation of "if you touch it, model minimum baseline requirements instead of existing conditions," but subsequently retracted that interpretation and declared this incorrect.  This is documented here:

Per the previously attached thread, that's exactly what I encountered.  Was a very happy surprise with many unanticipated credits.

What's not crystal clear in all of this is precisely how LEED makes the call to consider an existing envelope a "retrofit" scenario.  It's my personal speculation/interpretation that it hinges simply on new building footprint per below, but if it were me doing a retrofit project today I'd personally be searching for something more concrete to back that up (perusing through all the archived CIR's, or perhaps issuing a new CIR if need be).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed 1.4 has been
	released
In-Reply-To: <012d01ce4761$59d90e00$0d8b2a00$@gov>
References: <012d01ce4761$59d90e00$0d8b2a00$@gov>
Message-ID: <018e01cf4523$4a6f8c30$df4ea490$@gov>

We are pleased to announce the release of the Building Controls Virtual Test
Bed 1.4.

 

The following changes have been made compared to version 1.3:

 

* Added two Python actors for scripting.

* Improved the Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation import
interface to support the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) for
co-simulation API for tool coupling.

* The example files have been updated for EnergyPlus 8.1. 

 

The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) is a freely available
open-source software environment that allows expert users to couple
different simulation programs for co-simulation, 

and to couple simulation programs with actual hardware. For example, the
BCVTB allows to simulate a building in EnergyPlus and the HVAC and control
system in Modelica, 

while exchanging data between the software as they simulate. The BCVTB is
based on the Ptolemy II software environment. 

The BCVTB allows expert users of simulation to expand the capabilities of
individual programs by linking them to other programs. 

Due to the different programs that may be involved in distributed
simulation, familiarity with configuring programs is essential.

 

Programs that are linked to the BCVTB are

 

* the EnergyPlus whole building energy simulation program,

* the Modelica modeling and simulation environment Dymola,

* the MATLAB and Simulink tools for scientific computing,

* the Radiance ray-tracing software for lighting analysis,

* the ESP-r integrated building energy modeling program,

* the TRNSYS system simulation program, 

* Functional Mock-up Units (FMU) for co-simulation,

* the BACnet stack, which allows exchanging data with BACnet compliant
Building Automation System (BAS),

* the analog/digital interface USB-1208LS from Measurement Computing
Corporation that can be connected to a USB port. 

 

In addition to using programs that are coupled to Ptolemy II, Ptolemy II's
graphical modeling environment can also be used to define models for control
systems, for physical devices, 

for communication systems or for post-processing and real-time
visualization.

Hello All,

I am simulating an industrial building with walls having different
insulations and 70 % Heat recovery.
I want to show the price savings for each case.

Like if i am using 2 inch of insulation and getting something like 4500
KWh/m2 of annual savings in energy then how to calculate the cost saving ??

If i knw the price of insulation euro/m2 ????

any help will be appreciated.

An updated version of EnergyPlusToFMU is now available at
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/fmu/EnergyPlus/export/index.html.

EnergyPlusToFMU is a software package written in Python which allows users
to export the building simulation program EnergyPlus version 8.0 or higher
as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation using the Functional
Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard version 1.0. This FMU can then be imported
into a variety of simulation programs that support the import of the
Functional Mock-up Interface for co-simulation. This capability allows for
instance to model the envelope of a building in EnergyPlus, export the model
as an FMU, import and link the model with an HVAC system model developed in
a system simulation tool such as the Modelica environment Dymola.

Our team has so far resisted to make the switch to the new version eQuest 3.65.

For those experiencing this new version, do you think that it is sturdy and stable enough? Any irritating issue you see?

Subject: [Equest-users] eQUEST v3.65 build 7163 released Mar 18 2014 - fixes hourly report viewer

I was visiting doe2.com this morning (as you do from time to time -- you know) and found that there was a relatively recent release of a new v 3.65 build.  From the "what's new" document:

eQUEST v3.65
build 7163 - public release ~ 18 March 2014 - w/ DOE-2.2 v48r
Fixes:
* Fixed issues with the simulation detailed results viewer application (D2SimViewer.exe) that
prevented the viewing of hourly results in some instances (all appeared as zero values) when
the correct results were located on the simulation output file (the .sim file).
* Fixed issues with the installation procedure sometimes failing in cases where the installation is
directed to a drive mounted from a network location.

Since I just sent this to the whole mailing list, you may wish to wait for a few days before downloading the new build.  I don't want to cause an unexpected flood of download requests on the doe2.com site.

If others notice a new eQUEST release, please post a note here.  I tend to miss them.

Cheers,
Brian

Hi,

I am new to Energy plus and would like to get help in simulating HVAC
system for 3 different scenario's:
1) radiant cooling - embedded into concrete slab and ,
2) radiant cooling - screed into surface of floor
3) Chilled beam (simulation for both active and passive) -  suspended from
ceiling.

Kindly provide me tips and inputs from your experience.

Thanks & Regards,

Message-ID: <770DA51B8CC79343A32830010D6E379A261A424E@PJWXMB-0001L.LEC-ADMIN.dmu.ac.uk>

Dear fellow building simulation users,

The deadline for submission to the Design Optimisation Competition 2014  (DOC2014, see: http://optimisationcompetition.org) has been extended by a full month, till 30 April. The decision was made on participants? requests, especially from those who have encountered issues with the earlier version of DesginBuilder v4, and could not utilize online simulation resources effectively. A new version of DesignBuilder v4 is now available. I am glad to report that majority of the early issues have been solved in this version.

Using online simulation in DesignBuilder is very simple ? just put in your user name and password the first time you use it and everything is connected. Here are some instructions on how this works: http://optimisationcompetition.org/wiki/doku.php?id=2014:tools. During the competition period (till 30 April), the participants are each given 3,000 hours of free computing time, which worth ?300 ($480), so they can use the full power of the new optimisation tool.

We intend to keep the competition registration open till Tuesday, 1 April. So if you haven?t registered, come grab the last chance of getting the new software and the free computing time. The registration page is http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/content/view/136/206/. You only need to supply your name, email address, organization, and country to register an account.

Best wishes,

Yi

Subject: [EnergyPlus_Support] Design Optimisation Competition Gen 2
Dear building simulation users,
The jEPlus team at De Montfort University is organizing the ?second generation? of the Design Optimisation Competition (DOC2014, see: http://optimisationcompetition.org) with DesignBuilder Software Ltd. This competition will be quite different to the other competitions you have known, because you are not only competing with your peers, but also entries from the last round. In DOC2014, we have kept most of the design tasks and criteria identical to DOC2012; therefore the previous entries are still valid. You are free to inspect, analyse, modify an existing design, and submit it as your own entry.
What difference does this make, you may ask. Well, for a start, it gives you a starting point allowing you to focus on improving the design without the need to create a model from scratch. It is much easier to enter the competition even if you are not familiar with DesignBuilder, and your ability to create a winner is less bound by your skills with the software.
Would not the competition be too easy, you asking? Quite the opposite! The bar for winning the competition is in fact very high ? your new design must outperform the champions of the last round to stand a chance. It is a real test to your ingenuity and knowledge of energy and buildings.
As software developers, we of course want to see how our new tools help the competitors in their quest. This competition will test DesignBuilder?s new optimisation tool, and the remote simulation solution by DMU. To find out more about the competition and the tools, please register for the free webinar at 15:00 GMT on Tuesday, 14 January:  http://designbuildersoftwareltd.cmail2.com/t/r-l-nurkthl-fkujdhyu-w/

Hi there,

I am modeling a VAV system in eQUEST. The designed system mechanical cooling is shut off in the winter. The VAV system selection in eQUEST results in winter mechanical cooling energy consumption. How can we model the mechanical cooling to shut off in the winter. I have tried number ways with no success. Help would be appreciated.

Thanks.

Create an availability schedule that locks it out during the winter months.  The real question is why does it think you have a cooling load in the winter.

Further to this, ensure your chilled water loop operation is not set to
Standby which will cause standby chiller losses all through the winter even
if there is no load.  You can set the loop to Demand (only run when a
chilled water valve is open), Snap or Schedule it.

Dear Sir/Madam,

?We are studying California Title 24 Rules for Non-Residential Buildings 
and we are not able to understand how the base case HVAC system is 
defined for the simulation under whole building performance approach of 
this book. 

During the study, we could not find any table similar to ASHRAE 90.1 
Appendix G where system type is defined based on the conditioned floor 
area and number of floors in the building.
Request you to guide us on the selection of HVAC system to create the 
base case of California Title 24 Rules for Non-Residential Buildings.

If you are just looking in the standard, you should find the "Nonresidential
Alternative Calculation Method (ACM) Approval Manual". This document
includes many of the modeling rules and baseline requirements for Title 24
compliance. HVAC systems are addressed in Section 2.5. Good luck!

1, 2014 (they were supposed to take effect on January 1, 2014, but this 
was delayed due to software problems so anything you try now is apt to 
be wrong).

The 2013 ACMs are available here: 
http://www.energy.ca.gov/title24/2013standards/implementation/documents/index.html

There are two manuals, residential and non-residential.

Once you see how it is laid out, you will have questions.  There is no 
single simple table.  You can post your questions to the list or send 
them to me.  I'll try to help.  There is also a "hotline" at 
title24 at energy.state.ca.us .  They will also answer questions for you.

The "hotline" is very good with knowledgeable people.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] TRAINING: DesignBuilder Simulation Training Days June
	2-6 Washington DC
Message-ID: <011401cf3727$9a8148d0$cf83da70$@naturalintelligence.us>

DesignBuilder is a state-of-the-art software tool for checking building energy, carbon, lighting and comfort performance. Developed to simplify the process of building simulation, DesignBuilder allows you to rapidly compare the function and performance of building designs and deliver results on time and on budget. 

The training will be run using the new version 4 of DesignBuilder and will cover many of the new and enhanced features such as the new geometric modeler with enhanced block geometry editing, the ability to mirror blocks, add individual surfaces, and produce cut-away/section visualizations.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days.

The course is organized so that architects, if they wish, could attend only the first 2-3 days while the last 2 days are more specifically oriented towards engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Dates: June 2-6, 2014

Location: American Institute of Architects, 1735 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20006-5292

Discounts are available for multiple company attendees booking 4 or more days.

Space is limited so we encourage early registration.

Additional course information and registration <http://designbuilderusa.com/training/designbuilder-simulation-training-days> .

Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use, most powerful graphical user interface to EnergyPlus available which includes ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G climate zone, constructions and baseline HVAC system templates.

Questions about the course may be sent to trainer at designbuilderusa.com

I've heard anecdotal comments of people experiencing poor cell phone reception after a

Message-ID: <53153DB2.3060309@engr.ucsb.edu>

Two students have a background in marine sciences involving ocean 
platforms and are learning building energy modelling.

Is there a source for weather data that is generated from something like 
a buoy or something that would not have any wind-blocks or other land 
based influences?

I see there is data available on the EERE website for Kwajalein Atoll in 
Marshall Islands but Im not sure if there are any big differences 
between this data and a sole platform in the middle of the ocean.

Although the study is a purely a hypothetical exercise, close to Norway 
would be ideal!

The ISD (Integrated Surface Hourly Database) of archived weather station reports from 
around the world includes dozens of reports from buoys or oil platforms in various 
places.   I have tended to ignore the buoys, but have kept track of the oil platform 
weather reports.  For Norway, there are three oil platforms with sufficient data to create 
simulation-usable weather files:

013755,Gullfax(Platform),2013,Complete,628,NOR_GULLFAX(PLATFORM)_013755_13.zip,NOR,61.033,2.033,10,0.0

The raw data from ISD can be accessed at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/isd/index.php

If you want more information or help about processing the ISD, please send me an e-mail.

these types of glazing systems will help reduce EMF's from the exterior.  As such, they 'may' reduce cell phone wave lengths as well.  I have not come across any studies, but the physics says it is possible.

I don't see how there could be any effect at all.  The wavelengths are 
totally incompatible.  Low-e coatings block the near-infrared radiation at 
wavelengths of 700 to 2400 nanometers.  Even at the ultraviolet end, the 
wavelengths are around 100 to 400 nanometers.  The 3G and 4G networks that 
cell phones use are way off from this.  Typically, cell phone wavelengths 
(at 0.8 to 2.4 Ghz, the RF portion of the spectrum) are about one foot long 
(or around 300 million nanometers) - not even in the same ball park.

An ex boss lived in a Passivhaus and he couldn't get signal in the middle
of London.

A triple glazed unit can be quite thick. There were also multiple layers of
foil faced insulation in the walls. The Passivhaus institut may have done
some research on this.

If low-e coating film is a conductor (even poor) it will shield
electro-magnetic waves. The better conductor is the better shield.  Some
type of coating uses metal-oxide, which could be conducting.

Larry,

I'm not ready to dismiss this effect totally. When I look at a plot of Low-E 
transmissivity, it's shown to block anything from 800 nanometers on up, although the plot 
stops at 2400 (see 
http://www.leyboldoptics.com/cms/upload/downloads/S_Low_E_Coating_Apollon.pdf page 2).  
Out of curiosity, I did a Google Search for "Low-E windows block cell phone signals"  and 
found this question raised in various web pages.  Expanding on what I had said previously, 
I do know of a building in Beijing (China Academy of Building Research) that did a facade 
retrofit a few years back, after which the staff reported they could no longer get cell 
phone signals.  I think I'll send my colleagues an e-mail to ask for more details.

Dear all,

My colleague, expert in low-e coating, told me that silver-based low-e coatings (most of the soft low-e coatings use Silver) will reflect most of the radio frequency waves. Indeed,  almost all of the radio power is reflected within the first few atoms of the metal material.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] 90.1-2010 section 6.5.6.1 energy recovery and MURBs
Message-ID: <B7FE24EB2E85FD47B9EB4A8DA59E76EFB96EC8B9CD@TREXCHMAIL.corp.tridel.com>

Hi All,

Regarding the requirement for energy recovery in high rise residential buildings following ASHRAE 90.1-2010, section 6.5.6.1,  I want to analyze the difference between a pressurized corridor system vs. in-suite ERV system, and get your opinions.

My building is in CZ 6A, and following this I would need energy recovery on a fan system if my design were greater than 80% fresh air, and greater than 0 cfm (i.e. any amount), down to greater than 5500 cfm and 30%-40% fresh air, per Table 6.5.6.1.

In a pressurized system, it is certainly feasible that these thresholds will be exceeded due to the high amount of air pumped into the corridors, at 100% OA.  However, you can get around this with exception 6.5.6.1h - the largest exhaust source is far less than 75% of the fan system design OA rate. In this case, that would be the central corridor fan, which is serving both the corridors and suites, and the exhaust would be the individual WC fans in suite.  Diagnosis - no ERVs needed.

In an in-suite ERV system, again the Table 6.5.6.1 thresholds will likely be exceeded , since any amount of flow will need heat recovery if it is more than 80% fresh air. In this case, each individual ERV is its own fan system, again at 100% OA.  The corridor system is compartmentalized from this, and again can be exempt per 6.5.6.1h, as there would be multiple exhaust sources.  In suite, however, the ERV supply and exhaust are balanced, and very likely within 75% of each other, so the exemption no longer applies. Diagnosis - ERVs not needed for corridors, but needed for suites. In other words, once an in-suite ERV strategy is designed, you are penalized for it.

However, if you include the terminal fancoil/heat pump flow when considering table 6.5.6.1, the % OA would likely drop below 30%, and therefore heat recovery is no longer needed. Is it appropriate to consider the terminal device flow here - be it either in series or parallel with the ERV?

Your thoughts are appreciated. Are there any other interpretations for this out there?

>From 6.5.6.1, ...when the system's supply air flow rates exceeds the value listed in Table 6.5.6.1...

My interpretation, and the way the way I have seen this interpreted in the past, is the systems air flow rate should include terminal fan coil/heat pump flow rates as well, because this is part of the "system".

I would also appreciate any other interpretations.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] 90.1-2010 section 6.5.6.1 energy recovery and MURBs

Hi All,

Regarding the requirement for energy recovery in high rise residential buildings following ASHRAE 90.1-2010, section 6.5.6.1,  I want to analyze the difference between a pressurized corridor system vs. in-suite ERV system, and get your opinions.

My building is in CZ 6A, and following this I would need energy recovery on a fan system if my design were greater than 80% fresh air, and greater than 0 cfm (i.e. any amount), down to greater than 5500 cfm and 30%-40% fresh air, per Table 6.5.6.1.

In a pressurized system, it is certainly feasible that these thresholds will be exceeded due to the high amount of air pumped into the corridors, at 100% OA.  However, you can get around this with exception 6.5.6.1h - the largest exhaust source is far less than 75% of the fan system design OA rate. In this case, that would be the central corridor fan, which is serving both the corridors and suites, and the exhaust would be the individual WC fans in suite.  Diagnosis - no ERVs needed.

In an in-suite ERV system, again the Table 6.5.6.1 thresholds will likely be exceeded , since any amount of flow will need heat recovery if it is more than 80% fresh air. In this case, each individual ERV is its own fan system, again at 100% OA.  The corridor system is compartmentalized from this, and again can be exempt per 6.5.6.1h, as there would be multiple exhaust sources.  In suite, however, the ERV supply and exhaust are balanced, and very likely within 75% of each other, so the exemption no longer applies. Diagnosis - ERVs not needed for corridors, but needed for suites. In other words, once an in-suite ERV strategy is designed, you are penalized for it.

However, if you include the terminal fancoil/heat pump flow when considering table 6.5.6.1, the % OA would likely drop below 30%, and therefore heat recovery is no longer needed. Is it appropriate to consider the terminal device flow here - be it either in series or parallel with the ERV?

Your thoughts are appreciated. Are there any other interpretations for this out there?

Thanks Ian,

As I was writing I convinced myself of the same conclusion based on that wording, but thought I would still put it out there to see if anyone has come across a different interpretation.

My interpretation, and the way the way I have seen this interpreted in the past, is the systems air flow rate should include terminal fan coil/heat pump flow rates as well, because this is part of the "system".

I would also appreciate any other interpretations.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Increased Ventilation Credit and Energy Modeling
Message-ID: <0EA9E4A184B01D468EA29CEFC03EA58F8DCE80@SBS1.DesignEngineersPC.local>

Good day,

I have a question regarding the LEED credit for Increased Ventilation (IEQc2).  This is the credit awarded for exceeding ventilation in all spaces by 30% beyond the ASHRAE standard 62.1 requirements.  It seems obvious that the design model ventilation rates would be those 30% higher than 62.1 requirements.  What then would the baseline model ventilation rates be?

If you strictly follow 90.1 Appendix G, you should always model baseline and proposed equivalent except for when taking credit for demand controlled ventilation.  However, it seems in this case that it could also be argued (by LEED) that you should model the ASHRAE 62.1 required ventilation rates in the baseline model, not those that are 30% higher and therefore pay the energy expense( most climates) for increased outside air.

Does anyone have any experience with LEED on this issue?  Thanks in advance.

Kind regards,
Joe Chappell

There has been lots of discussion and misinformation about this in the
past.  I believe the current take on this from a LEED perspective is that
for each space in the proposed design where ventilation is above the
required minimum AND there is demand controlled ventilation, the equivalent
space in the baseline design shall be modeled with the minimum required
ventilation as per ASHRAE 62.1.  For all other cases, baseline ventilation
rates should match the proposed ventilation rates, regardless of whether
the proposed design uses an increased ventilation rate or not.

Message-ID: <C4B3436E467E7447A5712837ED007A8431C022FB@MAIL.mdaengr.com>

I have an old LEED v2.2 project using 90.1-2004.  The project has heat pump hot gas reheat dehumidification of a dedicated outside air stream (not dehumidifying the space, just the ventilation air).

I can't find anything in 90.1-G that says how to model dehumidification in the baseline.  The baseline units are constant volume DX with natural gas heat.  Even though a DOAS is not required, could I show a baseline model DX DOAS unit appropriately configured for Appendix G with natural gas reheat for dehumidification in order to show savings?  I'm using Trace and am not sure how to show dehumidification of an air stream but not the entire space, but that is another matter.

Any hints or direction is appreciated.

I have to agree with Karen on this.  For LEED modeling at least, you can model the ventilation rates the same even if they are above 62.1 minimums.  I would add though that you could apply Addendum bj to 90.1-2007 which add an exception to this for ventilation systems that improve air distribution effectiveness (primarily displacement ventilation systems).  I'm not sure if USGBC has ruled on this specifically but they generally allow one to adopt 90.1 addenda as long as you state which ones you're using.  This addendum also adds an exception for DCV similar to what Karen mentioned.

I have to say:

*         I have not followed the GBCI closely on this topic,

*         But it seems like the credit was created to "compare and contrast" the benefits of increased IEQ against the known energy penalty.

I have to agree with Karen on this.  For LEED modeling at least, you can model the ventilation rates the same even if they are above 62.1 minimums.  I would add though that you could apply Addendum bj to 90.1-2007 which add an exception to this for ventilation systems that improve air distribution effectiveness (primarily displacement ventilation systems).  I'm not sure if USGBC has ruled on this specifically but they generally allow one to adopt 90.1 addenda as long as you state which ones you're using.  This addendum also adds an exception for DCV similar to what Karen mentioned.

Worth noting that if you are modeling for LEED for Homes Midrise projects, you follow the modified version of Appendix G that appears in the ENERGY STAR Multifamily High Rise Simulation Guidelines, which puts a cap on your baseline ventilation flow rates of no more than 150% of 62.2.

The GBCI approach seems to be aimed at keeping people from gaming the system, more than suggesting designers stick to the 62.1 minimum. Don't add a bunch of extra OA to get the LEED credit, and then claim energy credit from DCV...

One point to contrast to this is that sometimes local codes, guidelines, or even client design standards might have rates higher than ASHRAE 62.1. In this case 90.1 can't contradict the designer's responsibility, and the baseline should have the identical outside air requirement, even if it is higher than ASHRAE 62.1.

62.1 is still a standard that sets the minimum ventilation rates.

As several others have noted there are specific conditions if DCV is used as a strategy to reduce outside air that might override the baseline OA quantity in some of those cases. It would also make sense to me that the baseline could be required to have an identical DCV system in that case and keep the rates the same, but I've never seen that as an official recommendation.

Dear (practicing) colleagues,

It would be wonderful if you decided to participate in a brief online survey on current practices for model setup and data management in building energy simulation. The survey is administered by the Sustainable Design Lab at MIT and the results will support an ongoing research project on building simulation assumptions used in practice, focusing specifically on material and construction properties, usage schedules, and building systems. Focus participants are practicing building energy modelers within architecture, engineering or sustainability consultancy firms, working at any design stage or capacity including schematic design, load calculations and complete compliance documentation.
If you fall into any of these categories, we would like you to fill out an online questionnaire about your day-to-day energy modeling practice. The questionnaire consists of 9 to 12 questions and should take no longer than 5 to 7 minutes to complete. Please respond to all questions as openly and honestly as possible. There is no right or wrong answer; it is only your opinions that are important. All of the information that we obtain from you through this survey will be kept confidential and your participation in this research is voluntary. Should you decide to participate in the survey, you still reserve the right to end your participation at any time and for any reason, without prejudice.
If you are interested in participating in this survey, please go to: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MITsimdatasurvey
Should you have any questions or suggestions, please contact Carlos Cerezo Davila at ccerezod at mit.edu<mailto:ccerezod at mit.edu>.
Thank you for your consideration,
Christoph and Carlos

Jim,

In my understanding the increased ventilation LEED point was created in
response to a deduction in the required ventilation rates by ASHRAE between
versions of 62.1. The confusion around how this affected the energy credit
came later.

I have to say:

?         I have not followed the GBCI closely on this topic,

?         But it seems like the credit was created to "compare and
contrast" the benefits of increased IEQ against the known energy penalty.

?         If that's true, then the Baseline should be per 62.1 and Proposed
at 1305 of the Baseline.

Great comments all, and correct for LEED v3.

This is changing in the new LEED v4. It references ASHRAE 90.1 2010 which
does *not *match the baseline Ventilation rate to a proposed design that
exceeds the rates set by the rating authority or building official.

This matches Jim's comments - a high ventilation rate will be penalized
under LEED v4, since the baseline is the minimum, and the proposed matches
the higher value of the design.

Cheers,
Alex

Greetings all!
I am attempting to optimize the passive design of a building using GenOpt as the optimizer, EnergyPlus as the primary energy model platform, and daylight reports from Daysim (an identical model to the Eplus model) which feed into the Eplus model.Each iteration dictated by GenOpt would need to simulate in Daysim and finish before simulating in Eplus.I am using a 'Master' batch file, referenced by GenOpt, to call Daysim and then Eplus.This process works when run straight from the batch file, but when run through GenOpt it does not create the temporary working directory correctly (.expidf and .err files missing), and so it crashes during the first iteration, saying ".err file does not exist".Simplifying the task to just optimize Eplus, but through a batch file, has the same result.The command line I've been working with consists of 3 parts: Call <RunEplus.bat> <model> <weatherfile>I've tried countless different variations of this command line but cant figure it out!
Has anyone optimized an EnergyPlus model through GenOpt using a batch file before? Or know what the command line might look like to do that?
Any ideas welcome!
Thanks,Tavis.

Hello Tavis,

Khaled Nassar presented in 2012 at the Radiance Workshop a process for

Look at RunDirMulti.bat that comes with EnergyPlus (in the main 
EnergyPlus folder).  It loops through a list of files and creates 
separate temp directories for a series of parallel runs.  You should be 
able to borrow from this or adapt it to your purposes.

Hi Tavis,

The lines below are from the "EnergyPlusWinXP.cfg" file that comes with GenOpt. Apparently GenOpt does use a batch file (customized RunEPlus.bat) to run E+. I think your best approach would be to modify the RunEPlus.bat file (or the RunEPlusParallel.bat file in GenOpt), and insert the part that runs DaySim in the same way that the other E+ preparatory steps are done...

**
/*  Specifying how to start the simulation program.
    In "Command", only those words in %xx% are
    replaced (possibly with empty Strings).
*/
SimulationStart
{
    // The command line below calls a custom version of RunEPlus.bat.
    // This is needed to run multiple EnergyPlus simulations in parallel,
    // because the standard version writes files to the EnergyPlus program
    // directory, and hence multiple simulations would access the same files.
    Command = "cmd /x /c \"start /D\"%Simulation.Files.Input.Path1%\" /WAIT /MIN call \".\\RunEPlusParallel.bat\" %Simulation.Files.Input.File1% %Simulation.CallParameter.Suffix%\"";
    WriteInputFileExtension = false;
}
**

Greetings all!

I am attempting to optimize the passive design of a building using GenOpt as the optimizer, EnergyPlus as the primary energy model platform, and daylight reports from Daysim (an identical model to the Eplus model) which feed into the Eplus model.
Each iteration dictated by GenOpt would need to simulate in Daysim and finish before simulating in Eplus.
I am using a 'Master' batch file, referenced by GenOpt, to call Daysim and then Eplus.
This process works when run straight from the batch file, but when run through GenOpt it does not create the temporary working directory correctly (.expidf and .err files missing), and so it crashes during the first iteration, saying ".err file does not exist".
Simplifying the task to just optimize Eplus, but through a batch file, has the same result.
The command line I've been working with consists of 3 parts:
Call <RunEplus.bat> <model> <weatherfile>
I've tried countless different variations of this command line but cant figure it out!

Has anyone optimized an EnergyPlus model through GenOpt using a batch file before? Or know what the command line might look like to do that?

Any ideas welcome!

Thanks,
Tavis.

Message-ID: <sjnbwh16cqaq7vson69wkqx8.1394837311150@email.android.com>

Dear BLDG-SIM community:

I'm working on energy savings calcs for a project that would use water from the Chicago River for a waterside economizer, via a heat exchanger.

Does anyone know if there are records of water temperature for the Chicago River?  If not the river, what about Lake Michigan as a proxy?  Hourly would be nice, but monthly would work.

And for the record, since it's almost St Patrick's Day, I don't think green dye affects the thermal properties of the river.  ;)

A million years ago, I did a study on the Palmer House. I recall winter time tap water being 44 degF. I also recall, as a Chicago boy, measuring summer tap water at 74 degF. But nothing monthly.

Hi, Thank you for your replies!

Alstan,
Yes, Khaled's tutorial for GenOpt + Radiance has been very helpful. I think the same input file structure could be used, plus the Daysim Header file.

Mike, 
This RunDirMulti.bat looks like it would be used to simulate a batch of pre-made EnergyPlus models in parallel, is this right? Or does it enable 1 model to run subsequent iterations? I need one iteration to finish before the next starts, so GenOpt can make its systematic changes to the model.

Yi,
I've tried copy pasting the Daysim batch file command lines in at the start of the RunEplus.bat so that it runs and completes before the Eplus model. This appears to work when run from the command shell, but, again, not when attempted through GenOpt. I think it comes back to Eplus and GenOpt- not creating temporary directories properly when called through a batch file (even following the command lines from GenOpts example files)?

Best regards,
Tavis.

Greetings all!


 


I am attempting to optimize the passive design of a building using GenOpt as the optimizer, EnergyPlus as the primary energy model platform, and daylight reports from Daysim (an identical model to the Eplus model) which feed into the Eplus
 model.


Each iteration dictated by GenOpt would need to simulate in Daysim and finish before simulating in Eplus.


I am using a 'Master' batch file, referenced by GenOpt, to call Daysim and then Eplus.


This process works when run straight from the batch file, but when run through GenOpt it does not create the temporary working directory correctly (.expidf and .err files missing), and so it crashes during the first iteration, saying ".err
 file does not exist".


Simplifying the task to just optimize Eplus, but through a batch file, has the same result.


The command line I've been working with consists of 3 parts: 


Call <RunEplus.bat> <model> <weatherfile>


I've tried countless different variations of this command line but cant figure it out!


 


Has anyone optimized an EnergyPlus model through GenOpt using a batch file before? Or know what the command line might look like to do that?


 


Any ideas welcome!

Bldg-sim folks,

We at Autodesk are gathering some feedback on building performance analysis workflows. The intent of this survey is to start a dialogue around product development with a community of users. An area of interest is how modeling and analysis work together in your design process/ workflow, specifically during the conceptual design phase.

Survey link<https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/3H7PMBV> - https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/3H7PMBV
Deadline: March 23

We will give $100 Amazon gift cards to five random survey respondents. The deadline for responding to get the gift cards is March 23 (one week left). The insights from this survey will go to the Autodesk BPA and Conceptual Design product development teams.

The members of this list represent some of the most sophisticated energy analysis users out there. Your feedback is very valuable.

Thanks,
- Adam

Hi Yi,

Very mysterious! Yip I've attached the two .cfg file I've tried (one based on the Eplus.cfg example file; the other based on the batchSimulation.cfg file), and the Master.bat file with the various command lines I've tried (as a word doc- email wouldn't allow to send .bat).
And the .ini and command.txt if that helps.

Thank you for your interest and help!

Best regards,
Tavis.

Hi Tavis,
 
Hmm, that?s mysterious. Do you share your batch file(s) with the group? I cannot see any problems from Java?s (GenOpt?s language) point of view?

Hi, Thank you for your replies!



Alstan,

Yes, Khaled's tutorial for GenOpt + Radiance has been very helpful. I think the same input file structure could be used, plus the Daysim Header file.



Mike, 

This RunDirMulti.bat looks like it would be used to simulate a batch of pre-made EnergyPlus models in parallel, is this right? Or does it enable 1 model to run subsequent iterations? I need one iteration to finish before the next starts, so GenOpt can make
 its systematic changes to the model.



Yi,

I've tried copy pasting the Daysim batch file command lines in at the start of the RunEplus.bat so that it runs and completes before the Eplus model. This appears to work when run from the command shell, but, again, not when attempted through GenOpt. I think
 it comes back to Eplus and GenOpt- not creating temporary directories properly when called through a batch file (even following the command lines from GenOpts example files)?






Best regards,

Tavis.

Hi Tavis,
 
The lines below are from the ?EnergyPlusWinXP.cfg? file that comes with GenOpt. Apparently GenOpt does use a batch file (customized RunEPlus.bat) to run
 E+. I think your best approach would be to modify the RunEPlus.bat file (or the RunEPlusParallel.bat file in GenOpt), and insert the part that runs DaySim in the same way that the other E+ preparatory steps are done?

 
**
/*  Specifying how to start the simulation program.
    In "Command", only those words in %xx% are

    replaced (possibly with empty Strings).
*/
SimulationStart
{
    // The command line below calls a custom version of RunEPlus.bat.
    // This is needed to run multiple EnergyPlus simulations in parallel,
    // because the standard version writes files to the EnergyPlus program
    // directory, and hence multiple simulations would access the same files.
    Command = "cmd /x /c \"start /D\"%Simulation.Files.Input.Path1%\" /WAIT /MIN call \".\\RunEPlusParallel.bat\" %Simulation.Files.Input.File1% %Simulation.CallParameter.Suffix%\"";
    WriteInputFileExtension = false;
}

Greetings all!


 


I am attempting to optimize the passive design of a building using GenOpt as the optimizer, EnergyPlus as the primary energy model platform, and daylight reports from Daysim (an identical model to the Eplus model) which feed into the
 Eplus model.


Each iteration dictated by GenOpt would need to simulate in Daysim and finish before simulating in Eplus.


I am using a 'Master' batch file, referenced by GenOpt, to call Daysim and then Eplus.


This process works when run straight from the batch file, but when run through GenOpt it does not create the temporary working directory correctly (.expidf and .err files missing), and so it crashes during the first iteration, saying
 ".err file does not exist".


Simplifying the task to just optimize Eplus, but through a batch file, has the same result.


The command line I've been working with consists of 3 parts: 


Call <RunEplus.bat> <model> <weatherfile>


I've tried countless different variations of this command line but cant figure it out!


 


Has anyone optimized an EnergyPlus model through GenOpt using a batch file before? Or know what the command line might look like to do that?


 


Any ideas welcome!


 


Thanks,


Tavis.

The problem is from wrapping the EPlusRun.bat in another batch file. Try use the third command-line in "IntegrateDaysim_EnergyPlus-7-2-0-Win7.cfg", i.e.

Command = "cmd /C \"\"D:\\MBSc500\\GenOpt\\IntegrateDaysim\\IntegrateDaysim_Master.bat\" \"%Simulation.Files.Input.File1%\" \"%Simulation.CallParameter.Suffix%\"\"";

And then change the call line in IntegrateDaysim_Master.bat to:

call "D:\MBSc500\GenOpt\IntegrateDaysim\RunEPlus.bat" %1 %2

And see if it works.

Yi,

No luck, the same error came up. 
I'm pretty new at this scripting business but as I understand it, the %1 and %2 are variables that the 'IntegrateDaysim_Master.bat' will substitute- the %1 for the model specified in the .cfg file (ChMod3.idf), and the %2 for the weather file specified in the .cfg. Is this correct?

Sebastian,

In the EE4 Modeling guide under Built-Up VAV, they state that you have the
option to choose between Series VAV Terminal and Parallel VAV Terminal but
that is greyed out in EE4.  With that being said I'm not sure what the best
way to model the system is if you stay in EE4 - you would need to account
for the intermittent terminal fan power somehow.

>From what I can tell in the DOE-2 basics guide you should model this type of
system as a Powered Induction Unit (PIU) which doesn't appear to be
available in EE4 so you would need to modify the .doe file in a text editor
and run the simulation outside of EE4.  Refer to the attached.

%1 and %2 represents the two arguments passed to IntegrateDaysim_Master.bat. For E+ simulation they are the idf the epw file names. I've tried a wrapper batch file by modifying one of GenOpt's examples; and it worked fine. Here are my modifications:

== wraprun.bat in C:\GenOptV3-1-0\example\energyplus\7_2_0\GPSHookeJeeves\ ==
call C:/EnergyPlusV7-2-0-64/RunEPlus.bat %1 %2

== EnergyPlus-7-2-0-Win7.cfg in C:\GenOptV3-1-0\cfg\ ==
...
SimulationStart
{
                // The command line below calls RunEPlus.bat.
                Command = "cmd /C \"C:/GenOptV3-1-0/example/energyplus/7_2_0/GPSHookeJeeves/wraprun.bat %Simulation.Files.Input.File1% %Simulation.CallParameter.Suffix%\"";
                WriteInputFileExtension = false;
}

== optWin7.ini in C:\GenOptV3-1-0\example\energyplus\7_2_0\GPSHookeJeeves\ ==
...
    Configuration {
      File1 = "..\\..\\..\\..\\cfg\\EnergyPlus-7-2-0-Win7.cfg";
}
...


Your problem may now come from moving RunEPlus.bat out of the E+ folder...

Yi,

No luck, the same error came up.
I'm pretty new at this scripting business but as I understand it, the %1 and %2 are variables that the 'IntegrateDaysim_Master.bat' will substitute- the %1 for the model specified in the .cfg file (ChMod3.idf), and the %2 for the weather file specified in the .cfg. Is this correct?

Regards,
Tavis.

The problem is from wrapping the EPlusRun.bat in another batch file. Try use the third command-line in "IntegrateDaysim_EnergyPlus-7-2-0-Win7.cfg", i.e.

Command = "cmd /C \"\"D:\\MBSc500\\GenOpt\\IntegrateDaysim\\IntegrateDaysim_Master.bat\" \"%Simulation.Files.Input.File1%\" \"%Simulation.CallParameter.Suffix%\"\"";

And then change the call line in IntegrateDaysim_Master.bat to:

call "D:\MBSc500\GenOpt\IntegrateDaysim\RunEPlus.bat" %1 %2

And see if it works.

Cheers,

Yi

Hi Yi,

Very mysterious! Yip I've attached the two .cfg file I've tried (one based on the Eplus.cfg example file; the other based on the batchSimulation.cfg file), and the Master.bat file with the various command lines I've tried (as a word doc- email wouldn't allow to send .bat).
And the .ini and command.txt if that helps.

Thank you for your interest and help!

Best regards,
Tavis.

Hi Tavis,

Hmm, that's mysterious. Do you share your batch file(s) with the group? I cannot see any problems from Java's (GenOpt's language) point of view...

Hi, Thank you for your replies!

Alstan,
Yes, Khaled's tutorial for GenOpt + Radiance has been very helpful. I think the same input file structure could be used, plus the Daysim Header file.

Mike,
This RunDirMulti.bat looks like it would be used to simulate a batch of pre-made EnergyPlus models in parallel, is this right? Or does it enable 1 model to run subsequent iterations? I need one iteration to finish before the next starts, so GenOpt can make its systematic changes to the model.

Yi,
I've tried copy pasting the Daysim batch file command lines in at the start of the RunEplus.bat so that it runs and completes before the Eplus model. This appears to work when run from the command shell, but, again, not when attempted through GenOpt. I think it comes back to Eplus and GenOpt- not creating temporary directories properly when called through a batch file (even following the command lines from GenOpts example files)?


Best regards,
Tavis.

Hi Tavis,

The lines below are from the "EnergyPlusWinXP.cfg" file that comes with GenOpt. Apparently GenOpt does use a batch file (customized RunEPlus.bat) to run E+. I think your best approach would be to modify the RunEPlus.bat file (or the RunEPlusParallel.bat file in GenOpt), and insert the part that runs DaySim in the same way that the other E+ preparatory steps are done...

**
/*  Specifying how to start the simulation program.
    In "Command", only those words in %xx% are
    replaced (possibly with empty Strings).
*/
SimulationStart
{
    // The command line below calls a custom version of RunEPlus.bat.
    // This is needed to run multiple EnergyPlus simulations in parallel,
    // because the standard version writes files to the EnergyPlus program
    // directory, and hence multiple simulations would access the same files.
    Command = "cmd /x /c \"start /D\"%Simulation.Files.Input.Path1%\" /WAIT /MIN call \".\\RunEPlusParallel.bat\" %Simulation.Files.Input.File1% %Simulation.CallParameter.Suffix%\"";
    WriteInputFileExtension = false;
}
**

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Coupling GenOpt, Energyplus and Daysim

Greetings all!

I am attempting to optimize the passive design of a building using GenOpt as the optimizer, EnergyPlus as the primary energy model platform, and daylight reports from Daysim (an identical model to the Eplus model) which feed into the Eplus model.
Each iteration dictated by GenOpt would need to simulate in Daysim and finish before simulating in Eplus.
I am using a 'Master' batch file, referenced by GenOpt, to call Daysim and then Eplus.
This process works when run straight from the batch file, but when run through GenOpt it does not create the temporary working directory correctly (.expidf and .err files missing), and so it crashes during the first iteration, saying ".err file does not exist".
Simplifying the task to just optimize Eplus, but through a batch file, has the same result.
The command line I've been working with consists of 3 parts:
Call <RunEplus.bat> <model> <weatherfile>
I've tried countless different variations of this command line but cant figure it out!

Has anyone optimized an EnergyPlus model through GenOpt using a batch file before? Or know what the command line might look like to do that?

Any ideas welcome!

Thanks,
Tavis.

Message-ID: <DUB126-W5772D934A13454DB176B9AE07F0@phx.gbl>

Hi all,

I'm looking for some guidance on estimating cafeteria kitchen energy usage for a high school. Are there any ballpark energy use per square foot values that I could use as the kitchen has not been designed yet? The school is located in a remote area of Canada and it will be powered by a fuel oil boiler. We need to get a sense of the overall energy consumption to start the preliminary sizing of the fuel storage tanks and generators.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Jeetendra,

I would suggest that you actually model the night flushing (whether this is flushing the occupied space or a thermal mass like TermoDeck hollow-core slab), as the performance and limits to this approach will be specific to the climate and the particulars of the design, including thermal mass, airflow rates, control strategies, etc.  In doing so, you'll want to use thermal comfort requirements, such as operative temperature at the beginning of the occupied hours, to limit the night flushing. In other words, it's important to avoid overcooling the space or taking credit for night flushing that does so, as this will tend to be offset by heating (in the model, actual use, or both). Also, be sure to fully account for fan energy in your model. If the night flushing must drive air through a convoluted path, you will need to account for the pressure the fan needs to overcome in doing so. If, on the other hand, you're using natural ventilation for night flushing, then you'll need to prepare an appropriate model of that using a bulk-airflow network or similar approach with suitable wind pressure coefficients,  description of operable openings, control of those openings, and pressure/buoyancy driven inter-zonal airflows. If mixed-mode, you really need to include both in the same model to understand the interactions.

Cheers,
Timothy

Message-ID: <BLU169-W15B0153145A3DA3B7B7BD8C6790@phx.gbl>

Any help regarding the reuse of an existing building LEED simulation would be helpful. We are working on an existing building that was a warehouse and is now an office building. The existing shell was un-insulated concrete block walls and an un-insulated metal roof with metal joists. Using the ASHRAE 90.1 guidelines for envelope allows the use of existing envelope, but in the climate zone at-hand our proposed envelope alone represents a 30% energy cost savings. Our question is whether there is an exception or limitation to using existing the envelope if a building use is changed, ours is now an office.

Thanks,
 
Ken

Hi Ken,

Attached is  thread from 9 months back where I reported being corrected to use actual envelope constructions for 3 consecutive projects (reviewed simultaneously), and also to remove baseline rotations.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Existing Envelope for LEED v3

Any help regarding the reuse of an existing building LEED simulation would be helpful. We are working on an existing building that was a warehouse and is now an office building. The existing shell was un-insulated concrete block walls and an un-insulated metal roof with metal joists. Using the ASHRAE 90.1 guidelines for envelope allows the use of existing envelope, but in the climate zone at-hand our proposed envelope alone represents a 30% energy cost savings. Our question is whether there is an exception or limitation to using existing the envelope if a building use is changed, ours is now an office.

Thanks,

Hi Ken,

Attached is  thread from 9 months back where I reported being corrected to use actual envelope constructions for 3 consecutive projects (reviewed simultaneously), and also to remove baseline rotations.

Per the previously attached thread, that's exactly what I encountered.  Was a very happy surprise with many unanticipated credits.

What's not crystal clear in all of this is precisely how LEED makes the call to consider an existing envelope a "retrofit" scenario.  It's my personal speculation/interpretation that it hinges simply on new building footprint per below, but if it were me doing a retrofit project today I'd personally be searching for something more concrete to back that up (perusing through all the archived CIR's, or perhaps issuing a new CIR if need be).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed 1.4 has been
	released
In-Reply-To: <012d01ce4761$59d90e00$0d8b2a00$@gov>
References: <012d01ce4761$59d90e00$0d8b2a00$@gov>
Message-ID: <018e01cf4523$4a6f8c30$df4ea490$@gov>

We are pleased to announce the release of the Building Controls Virtual Test
Bed 1.4.

 

The following changes have been made compared to version 1.3:

 

* Added two Python actors for scripting.

* Improved the Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation import
interface to support the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) for
co-simulation API for tool coupling.

* The example files have been updated for EnergyPlus 8.1. 

 

The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) is a freely available
open-source software environment that allows expert users to couple
different simulation programs for co-simulation, 

and to couple simulation programs with actual hardware. For example, the
BCVTB allows to simulate a building in EnergyPlus and the HVAC and control
system in Modelica, 

while exchanging data between the software as they simulate. The BCVTB is
based on the Ptolemy II software environment. 

The BCVTB allows expert users of simulation to expand the capabilities of
individual programs by linking them to other programs. 

Due to the different programs that may be involved in distributed
simulation, familiarity with configuring programs is essential.

 

Programs that are linked to the BCVTB are

 

* the EnergyPlus whole building energy simulation program,

* the Modelica modeling and simulation environment Dymola,

* the MATLAB and Simulink tools for scientific computing,

* the Radiance ray-tracing software for lighting analysis,

* the ESP-r integrated building energy modeling program,

* the TRNSYS system simulation program, 

* Functional Mock-up Units (FMU) for co-simulation,

* the BACnet stack, which allows exchanging data with BACnet compliant
Building Automation System (BAS),

* the analog/digital interface USB-1208LS from Measurement Computing
Corporation that can be connected to a USB port. 

 

In addition to using programs that are coupled to Ptolemy II, Ptolemy II's
graphical modeling environment can also be used to define models for control
systems, for physical devices, 

for communication systems or for post-processing and real-time
visualization.

I am simulating an industrial building with walls having different

I want to show the price savings for each case.

Like if i am using 2 inch of insulation and getting something like 4500
KWh/m2 of annual savings in energy then how to calculate the cost saving ??

If i knw the price of insulation euro/m2 ????

An updated version of EnergyPlusToFMU is now available at
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/fmu/EnergyPlus/export/index.html.

EnergyPlusToFMU is a software package written in Python which allows users
to export the building simulation program EnergyPlus version 8.0 or higher
as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for co-simulation using the Functional
Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard version 1.0. This FMU can then be imported
into a variety of simulation programs that support the import of the
Functional Mock-up Interface for co-simulation. This capability allows for
instance to model the envelope of a building in EnergyPlus, export the model
as an FMU, import and link the model with an HVAC system model developed in
a system simulation tool such as the Modelica environment Dymola.

Our team has so far resisted to make the switch to the new version eQuest 3.65.

For those experiencing this new version, do you think that it is sturdy and stable enough? Any irritating issue you see?

I was visiting doe2.com this morning (as you do from time to time -- you know) and found that there was a relatively recent release of a new v 3.65 build.  From the "what's new" document:

eQUEST v3.65
build 7163 - public release ~ 18 March 2014 - w/ DOE-2.2 v48r
Fixes:
* Fixed issues with the simulation detailed results viewer application (D2SimViewer.exe) that
prevented the viewing of hourly results in some instances (all appeared as zero values) when
the correct results were located on the simulation output file (the .sim file).
* Fixed issues with the installation procedure sometimes failing in cases where the installation is
directed to a drive mounted from a network location.

Since I just sent this to the whole mailing list, you may wish to wait for a few days before downloading the new build.  I don't want to cause an unexpected flood of download requests on the doe2.com site.

If others notice a new eQUEST release, please post a note here.  I tend to miss them.

Cheers,
Brian

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Design Optimisation Competition - deadline extended
Message-ID: <770DA51B8CC79343A32830010D6E379A261A424E@PJWXMB-0001L.LEC-ADMIN.dmu.ac.uk>

Dear fellow building simulation users,

The deadline for submission to the Design Optimisation Competition 2014  (DOC2014, see: http://optimisationcompetition.org) has been extended by a full month, till 30 April. The decision was made on participants? requests, especially from those who have encountered issues with the earlier version of DesginBuilder v4, and could not utilize online simulation resources effectively. A new version of DesignBuilder v4 is now available. I am glad to report that majority of the early issues have been solved in this version.

Using online simulation in DesignBuilder is very simple ? just put in your user name and password the first time you use it and everything is connected. Here are some instructions on how this works: http://optimisationcompetition.org/wiki/doku.php?id=2014:tools. During the competition period (till 30 April), the participants are each given 3,000 hours of free computing time, which worth ?300 ($480), so they can use the full power of the new optimisation tool.

We intend to keep the competition registration open till Tuesday, 1 April. So if you haven?t registered, come grab the last chance of getting the new software and the free computing time. The registration page is http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/content/view/136/206/. You only need to supply your name, email address, organization, and country to register an account.

Best wishes,

Yi

Subject: [EnergyPlus_Support] Design Optimisation Competition Gen 2
Dear building simulation users,
The jEPlus team at De Montfort University is organizing the ?second generation? of the Design Optimisation Competition (DOC2014, see: http://optimisationcompetition.org) with DesignBuilder Software Ltd. This competition will be quite different to the other competitions you have known, because you are not only competing with your peers, but also entries from the last round. In DOC2014, we have kept most of the design tasks and criteria identical to DOC2012; therefore the previous entries are still valid. You are free to inspect, analyse, modify an existing design, and submit it as your own entry.
What difference does this make, you may ask. Well, for a start, it gives you a starting point allowing you to focus on improving the design without the need to create a model from scratch. It is much easier to enter the competition even if you are not familiar with DesignBuilder, and your ability to create a winner is less bound by your skills with the software.
Would not the competition be too easy, you asking? Quite the opposite! The bar for winning the competition is in fact very high ? your new design must outperform the champions of the last round to stand a chance. It is a real test to your ingenuity and knowledge of energy and buildings.
As software developers, we of course want to see how our new tools help the competitors in their quest. This competition will test DesignBuilder?s new optimisation tool, and the remote simulation solution by DMU. To find out more about the competition and the tools, please register for the free webinar at 15:00 GMT on Tuesday, 14 January:  http://designbuildersoftwareltd.cmail2.com/t/r-l-nurkthl-fkujdhyu-w/

Hi there,

I am modeling a VAV system in eQUEST. The designed system mechanical cooling is shut off in the winter. The VAV system selection in eQUEST results in winter mechanical cooling energy consumption. How can we model the mechanical cooling to shut off in the winter. I have tried number ways with no success. Help would be appreciated.

Thanks.

Create an availability schedule that locks it out during the winter months.  The real question is why does it think you have a cooling load in the winter.

Further to this, ensure your chilled water loop operation is not set to
Standby which will cause standby chiller losses all through the winter even
if there is no load.  You can set the loop to Demand (only run when a
chilled water valve is open), Snap or Schedule it.
