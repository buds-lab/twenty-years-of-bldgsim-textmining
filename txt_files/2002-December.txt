Subject: [BLDG-SIM] New: TMY2BIN creates bin weather files from TMY2 files
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200212042337.AA370531pd80000225612@gard.com>

hvacware.net announces:  TMY2BIN

This program converts TMY2 weather files to bin weather data for quick
energy calulations. It considers the dry bulb temperature only. And
currently, only US imperial units. Your can choose to create 2 degree, 4
degree, 5 degree, or 10 degree temperature bins. There is also an 8760
hourly output option so you can perform more detailed studies. 

As you know, TMY2 weather files for most major cities are available for
free on the Internet.

The really great thing about this bin weather file generator is it's
method of separating occupied hours from unoccupied hours.  It takes a
few simple clicks to define the occupied periods.

Excuse the partial reference, but I am away from my office right now...

Arthur D. Little and others assembled data for EPRI on this in support of
hourly water heater modeling in the late 1980s.  It may have a longer
history than that.  I know the data can be found in the old EPRI ESPRE
User's Manual Appendix A.  It has average annual water temperature for about
150 cities.  It also includes a factor for seasonal temperature variation,
with the variation using a sinusoidal formula (1992) and amplitude that
varies by city.

I'm looking for a data source for typical inlet water 
temperatures (water main temperature) for residential 
service water heaters for locations in the United States.  
This is roughly equivalent to the ground temperature at 6 
to 8 feet depth. The temperature varies seasonally so 
knowing the average monthly value would be best.  

I am already aware of two sources of data that don't really 
help: Engineering Weather Data from NCDC has the 50 ft 
temperature and the map in the old ASHRAE Load Calculation 
Manual is for depths of 4 inches. 

Any leads would be appreciated.

The next IFC HVAC implementers teleconference will take place on January
8, as announced last Friday.  The starting time will change a bit,
however: The teleconference will start at 16:30 GMT (not at 15:00 GMT,
as previously announced).  That is 8:30 PST and 11:30 EST in the U.S.,
17:30 in continental Europe, 18:30 in Finland, etc.

I made a couple of mistakes in the previous announcement.  The deadline
to notify me about participation in the teleconference is Friday,
January 3 (not December 3).  Documents that served as background in the
discussion on December 13 are posted on the FTP site, not http; thus the
correct address to download these documents is
ftp://iaiweb.lbl.gov/International/Technical/Projects/IFC_Release_3.0/DomainProjectDirs/BS-8_HvacModeling&Simulation/documents/DC_Meeting/.
I am sorry for any inconvenience these mistakes may have caused you.

I wish you all happy holidays and a successful implementation year!

You might want to look at:
Kusuda, T., P.R. Achenbach (1965), Earth Temperature and Thermal Diffusivities at Selected Stations in the United States. ASHRAE Transactions.

This gives a model that allows you to calculated temps at different depths near the surface, and the variation through the year. Sorry but I don't have the volume and page numbers.

Jason,

1) National Well Water Association publishes annual average groundwater
temperatures for the various regions in the country.
2) see also Labs, K.,  Underground building Climate. Solar Age, 1979.
4(10),p.44-50.
He recommends to add two degrees to NOAA average annual outside air
temperature to calculate the inlet water temperature. The comparison
showed that in the majority of cases, the inlet water temperature
averages 2deg F  warmer than the outside air temperature.

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200212201023.AA2329890pd80000232468@gard.com>

IFC HVAC definitions have been extended to support exchange among design
and simulation applications.  The integration of the HVAC extension
schemata with the IFC core model is in progress right now; the new
version of the IFC data model (IFC2x2) that will include these
extensions will be released in May 2003.  Software implementation of the
new IFC2x2 model (based on the beta release) can start three months from
now.  LBNL plans to follow that schedule and develop a comprehensive
IFC2x2 interface to EnergyPlus that will implement the new IFC HVAC
definitions.

The extended IFC HVAC model includes more than most HVAC and/or related
applications need to implement individually.  HVAC and related
developers need to agree which definitions need to be implemented by
*all* implementations, and which need not be implemented at all.  In
addition, they need to agree how to commonly implement abstract concepts
such as relationships, systems, groups, etc., to facilitate meaningful
data exchange.  In other words, there is a need to formulate
implementers' agreements for HVAC applications, similar to what IAI CAD
developers have done for their IFC implementations.

HVAC implementers' agreements will provide the basis for HVAC data
exchange among more than just HVAC applications.  Critical application
developers from other related industry disciplines that also use HVAC
data (such as cost estimating, CAD, construction management, project
management and facilities management) will also participate in the
forging of HVAC implementers' agreements.

The initial IFC HVAC implementers meeting to start the formulation of
these implementers' agreements was held in Washington, DC on December
13.  All key stakeholders participated in the meeting either in person
or via a virtual link.  These included representatives of the major
North American HVAC design software houses (such as Carrier, Trane and
Wrightsoft) and related disciplines (such as Timberline for cost
estimating), as well as representatives of the U.S. government that are
engaged in the development of HVAC related software.  Also attending
were representatives from Olof Granlund from Finland.

The formulation of IFC HVAC implementers' agreements will continue via
virtual meetings: Beginning in January 2003 LBNL will host bi-weekly
teleconferences and NetMeetings.  These teleconferences will be free of
cost to the participants.  The first of such teleconferences will take
place on Wednesday, January 8 at 15:00 GMT.  If you are interested in
participating in the teleconference, please contact v_bazjanac at lbl.gov
by Friday, December 3 to receive dial in instructions.

An IFC HVAC implementers two-day workshop will be held (at a location to
be determined) later in January or early in February; we will solicit
suggestions on the place and time of this workshop from potential
participants.  The objective of the workshop will be to explain the HVAC
schemata in IFC2x2 in detail to HVAC software developers.  The goal is
to forge a basis for consensus about implementers' agreements by March,
so that implementations can start on time.

Everyone with an interest in the implementation of the IFC HVAC schemata
is invited to join this effort.  Materials from the December 13 meeting
are posted on the BS-8 web site at
http://iaiweb.lbl.gov/International/Technical/Projects/IFC_Release_3.0/DomainProjectDirs/BS-8_HvacModeling&Simulation/documents/DC_Meeting/;
additional materials will be added as they are developed.  We are
looking forward to your participation in this effort.

(Apologies for cross postings.)

Introduction to EnergyPlus for Experienced Modelers    

January 29-31, 2003, Chicago, Illinois, USA    

Come to this EnergyPlus training course immediately following the 
Chicago ASHRAE meeting in January.  The course schedule is:  

Wednesday, January 29, 2:00 to 6:00 pm  
Thursday, January 30, 8:30 am to 5:30 pm
Friday, January 31, 8:30 am to 1:00 pm     

This workshop will introduce EnergyPlus to experienced modelers who 
are familiar with the basic concepts of energy simulation.  The 
course will cover the mechanics of using EnergyPlus with an emphasis 
on aspects of EnergyPlus that differ substantially from other common 
modeling tools (e.g., DOE-2 and BLAST), such as the use of a multiple 
time-step approach, the integrated simulation of loads, systems and 
plant, and defining fluid and air loops.  Bring your own laptop for 
the hands-on workshop sessions.    

The course will be held in "the loop" in Chicago at the Crowne Plaza 
Silversmith, 10 South Wabash Avenue (1 block north of the Palmer 
House Hilton which is the ASHRAE headquarters hotel).    

For more details on the course outline, registration fees, and 
accomodations please see

Future courses:      

Introduction to EnergyPlus for Beginning Modelers, 4 day course, 
Spring 2003      

Advanced use of EnergyPlus, 2 day course, Early Summer 2003
