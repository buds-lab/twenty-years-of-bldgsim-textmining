Is data available on equivalent full load (EFL) cooling hours for
commercial facilities based on building type and climate? I am looking
for space cooling information for supermarkets.

Aleka,

Grease contamination is partially minimized by filtering of grease
contamination.  Fisher-Nickel (FSTC PG&E) is doing research of standardizing
of grease removal system.  I have provided a link to the site....They have
done a lot of research on ckv along with ERV on exhaust.

http://www.fishnick.com/ckv/greasegroup/

Hope that helps some...

Suneel

  Does anyone know of an example of kitchen exhaust heat recovery or any
research on the topic?  I?m trying to find out if it?s possible considering
the grease contamination in the exhaust.  We heard something about a heat
exchanger made from a duct within a duct for this purpose, but can?t seem to
find any information on it.



  Thanks,

  aleka

My concern is that is over simplifying the process.  It is the build up on
the interior pipe walls that is the concern.  I estimate that the drain pipe
temperature will be 15-25 deg C.  If grease builds up anywhere along this
run, you increase the probability of a drain backup over time.  Draining
warm/hot water minimizes the buildup of grease/dirt.  Removing heat from
exiting water will increase likelyhood of buildup on the draining pipe.

Ultimately you need to consider, pipe length, pipe temperature and water
temperature along with how much heat that is being removed.

I hope my comments are not being seen as negative, but more trying to avoid
a very messy situation down the road.

Cheers
Suneel

  We'll that could be determined. Find out at what temperature grease in
water will solidify then find what temperature differential there would be
between the draining hot water before and after the heat exchanger.

  I'm sure Carmine would know.

Martin, Suneel & sim folk,
As an aside, another energy approach we used with success in Florida in
the early 90's in commercial kitchens is to reduce primary energy used
for domestic hot water, and use heat rejection from a cooling or
refrigeration load to preheat the cold water.

	If anyone has used the GFX heat exchangers, have they
experienced additional clogs in the drain? 
	 
	My concern would be is that if you remove too much heat from the
draining material, the grease component would tend to solidify and over
time could end up clogging the drain after where the heat exchanger
device is installed.  One of the benefits of draining hot water is that
it keeps the grease in a fluid state.
	 
	This could be an over reaction, but has made me reluctant to

Fifteenth Symposium on

Improving Building Systems in Hot and Humid Climates

 

Call for Papers

 

The Buena Vista Palace Hotel, Orlando, Florida

July 24-26, 2006

 

 

Abstract deadline January 16th

 

Hosted by

Energy Systems Laboratory and Florida Solar Energy Center

 

About the Abstracts

 

Technical papers are solicited for the 2006 Symposium on Improving
Building Systems in Hot and Humid Climates to be held July 24-26, 2006.
For the first time the Symposium will be held outside of Texas. ESL's
past relationship with the Florida Solar Energy Center provided an
opportunity to partner with a world class academic and research center
for energy studies. The conference site will be the Buena Vista Palace
Hotel (formerly the Wyndham Palace Resort) in Orlando, Florida.  This
unique and premier conference focuses principally on building air
conditioning performance in hot and humid climates. Attendees are upper
level energy managers, building managers, architects, designers,
consultants, utility representatives, code officials, equipment
manufacturers and suppliers, consumers and researchers from around the
world.

 

The purpose of the symposium is to accomplish technology transfer-from
the laboratories of leading academic institutions, research
organizations and industry; and from the best practices of practicing
design and operations professionals-to the building industry at large.
Identification of new equipment and processes is of major importance.
However, the paper and presentation should be free of commercialism.

 

Authors wishing to present a paper for consideration must submit a
200-400 word abstract of each proposed paper to the Program Coordinator
no later than Monday, January 16, 2006 (electronic format required). All
abstracts will be peer reviewed, and the acceptance based on content
quality, originality and composition.  A draft copy of an accepted paper
must be received by Monday, March 20, 2006.  The final corrected
manuscripts must be received by Monday, May 29, 2006.

 

Papers are usually allotted 20-25 minutes for presentation, followed by
a five-minute discussion.  The presenter of each paper receives a
reduced registration rate to the symposium, which includes a copy of the
proceedings and admission to all technical sessions.  

 

Instructions for Abstracts

 

1.   Abstracts should be 200 to 400 words in length.

2.   Include one or more keywords from the list of topics.

3.   Include title and all co-authors, address, phone number, fax number
and email address.

Include primary author's full name and company position.

Include short cover biography of primary author.

6.   Abstracts must be received by Monday, January 16, 2006 (electronic
format required).

Subject: [bldg-sim] eQuest 3.55 importing CAD question

This is something that I noticed as soon as I switched to the latest version
(3.55) of eQuest.  The only workaround that I found is to edit polygons only
in the Space Properties dialogue.

Previously, we could create all the project polygons all at once and then
assign to Spaces as they were created, but now you must create polygons as
the Spaces are created if you need to see your Autocad background to do so.

I have discussed this with the people at DOE2.com and they say that this is
the way things will be from now on.

Subject: [bldg-sim] eQuest 3.55 importing CAD question



I'm having trouble importing (okay, not really importing, but viewing!)
CAD files into eQuest.

I can start editing a specific polygon, and go through the importing
process, however as long as I'm looking at that polygon, the CAD file is
not visible.  Nor are the layers command or the CAD drawing properties
available to me.

Once I move up a level to the polygons folder, I can see the CAD file.
But trying to edit a polygon, no cad file.  The file is loaded into the
program, as the file is in the PD2 file...it continues to be available
when looking at the whole building as opposed to one polygon or floor.

I remember using these functions successfully before, but can't seem to
figure them out.  Has something changed in the new release?

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks!

David

Sorry, must have missed the original request. You might want to see 
if you can get any of the data from the Pala test houses. They has 
been used for many studies, but one of the more relevant is:

R. Meldem and F. Winkelmann, 1995. Comparison of DOE-2 with 
Measurements in the Pala Test Houses, LBL-37979, Lawrence Berkeley

Hi,

I am wondering, if any measurement data exists for a test room/chamber
containing solid building material (e.g. a concrete or brick wall)
concerning the dynamic influence of the thermal mass on the internal
conditions.
Of interest is the temperature and air flow distribution as well as the
surface heat transfer for comparison with my CFD routine.

I'd greatly appreciate it, if somebody can tell where to find such a
data set or can provide me with any.

David,
   
  Thank you for your input. I created a Equipment Control and put a ice-making chiller under it for ice-build specifically. Also I had another Equipment Control for discharging and chiller use. I put the two Equipment Controls under a Load Management that manages the two control scenarios using different control flags. I am not quite sure if my above practice is correct. Please advise.
   
  Thank you in advance.

  Hi folks,
   
  I am simulating a partial ice-storage system using Equest. One of the 
chillers in the plant has to operate under low temperature to make ice 
during off-peak hours, while during on-peak hours it runs under high 
temperature to supply chilled water to coils. To my knowledge it shoulf 
be a dual-condition chiller, screw or centrifugal type. 
   
  I am wondering how I can model this dual-condition chiller in Equest. 
Can one performance curve represent the chiller's performance of making 
both ice and chilled water?  If my understanding is correct, each 
chiller in Equest can only be assigned with one performance curve.
   
  I highly appreciate if any expert provide some successful examples of 
both ice-storage simulation and that dual-condition chiller curve.
   
  Best,
  Glenn Wu

Hi,

I am wondering, if any measurement data exists for a test room/chamber
containing solid building material (e.g. a concrete or brick wall)
concerning the dynamic influence of the thermal mass on the internal
conditions.
Of interest is the temperature and air flow distribution as well as the
surface heat transfer for comparison with my CFD routine.

I'd greatly appreciate it, if somebody can tell where to find such a data

temperature to supply chilled water to coils. To my knowledge it shoulf
be a dual-condition chiller, screw or centrifugal type.

  I am wondering how I can model this dual-condition chiller in Equest.
Can one performance curve represent the chiller's performance of making
both ice and chilled water?  If my understanding is correct, each
chiller in Equest can only be assigned with one performance curve.

  I highly appreciate if any expert provide some successful examples of
both ice-storage simulation and that dual-condition chiller curve.

Hi,

I am wondering, if any measurement data exists for a test room/chamber containing solid building material (e.g. a concrete or brick wall) concerning the dynamic influence of the thermal mass on the internal conditions. 
Of interest is the temperature and air flow distribution as well as the surface heat transfer for comparison with my CFD routine.

I'd greatly appreciate it, if somebody can tell where to find such a data set or can provide me with any.

Ian. 

We've got 24 Habitat houses analyzed n the thesis by Kootin-Sanwu in central Texas, as well as several years of meas data from one house. We are currently working on evaluating 120 houses built locally over a 10 year period to evaluate 2000 IECC code impact. Preliminary results look good at about 10% annual reduction when annalyzed with PRISM. Next step will be to use sliding PRISM since we see a curious upward trend on every new house for the first 12 months. 

We have also evaluated 100,000+/yr  new housing starts from 2001 to present, which can be found in the ESL. SB5 report to the TCEQ/EPA at "eslsb5.tamu.edu", or use the DOE-2 based calculator at "ecalc.tamu.edu".

Hi Mike,

thanks for your input.  My initial reasoning for the individual parametric runs was to us the baseline building as the reference so that I could measure the magnitude of the impact of the individual ECMs so that I could demonstrate to the client that improving the glass performance made a larger impact than just increasing the roof insulation.  

I see how you are saying that if I built the parametrics to add on to one another the cumulative effect automatically happens.  Thanks.

Why would using parametric runs result in an overlap of savings?  If you
set the baseline of each parametric run to the previous parametric run
rather than the project baseline you won't have that problem.  I think
this is going to be the easiest way to get exactly what you want. 

Another idea is to try and use unique sub-meters but the problem with
that is you cannot capture central plant energy(boilers, chillers,
etc...) by HVAC System.  However unlike the parametric runs you can set
this up in the .inp file so you could write code to automate the
process.

Hi folks,

I am currently modeling energy-saving mechanical retrofits for buildings
using eQuest. The retrofits are modeled using parametric runs.

In the end, I want to have sitting in front of me a table with all of
the savings broken up by AHU.

i.e.             steam savings     elec savings     gas savings
etc...
     AHU-1      ....                      ....                   ....
     AHU-2      ....                      ....                   
....                 
     AHU-3      ....                      ....                   ....

eQuest only displays savings by type of enduse.

Does anyone have any recommendations or strategies for obtaining this
data? I should add that I have 80+ buildings to do, so I am looking for
a method that is most efficient. One possibility is to do each of the
AHU retrofits as a separate parametric run. However, this will lead to
an overlap in savings. Since I have so many files to do, I am also
considering writing a small C++ program.

thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200512290949.AA4943500pd80000916913@gard.com>

FYI. 

There have been a few studies in the ASHRAE literature about reducing energy use in grocery stores. Most have focused on the design of the refrigeration systems, with very few discussing the simulation using DOE-2. 

If my memory serves me right the refrigeration commands in DOE-2 were added by LBL for a project with Seattle City and Light. I believe there is a paper in the old ACEEE proceedings by Colleen Cleary that details the project. I'm sure there is also an LBL report on this as well. Unfortunately, I think you'll be hard-pressed to simulate a complex, staged system with DOE-2 since this would involve manf curves and a need for site data to verify the conditions, etc. You may find better advice in the Food Marketing Institute publications, and/or material they distribute at their conferences. ARI has tons of material on this.  RMI has also done a bit of looking in this area, which would more than likely mean there is an Esource publication as well. 

There is some general design advice for hot humid climates. 1) Seal the building, reduce envelope loads, and use airlock entries to keep the moisture out. Use positive pressure to reduce infiltration. 2) Do your dehumidification with the most efficient system, which would be the A/C system, or dessicant system.  Avoid moisture in your freezer cases by keeping the store dry (less than 50% RH), use cased-in freezers. (I've noticed systems in Florida with AC supply duct pointed right at the Freezer cases to create a pool of dry air at the Freezer door). 3) Use the most efficient refrigeration system avail. 4) Reduce internal loads, use daylighting, etc. 

I'm sure there are a few more things I left-out.

Subject: [bldg-sim] Attached buildings in eQUEST

I have similar problems with trying to simulate a supermarket inside a mall!
I have to also do the simulation in equest in imperial units, when all my
background and local standards are metric! Will a metric version of the
interface be available soon anyone?

Is it possible to set the walls as having a schedule, or the
interconnections to the mall as being a separate metered source?

The supermarket I am trying to model almost completely inside the mall!, the
outer shell to the outside is on one side the warehouse of the supermarket
(narrow around 2 sides, 1 side and partially another is exposed to the mall
enviroment. Only half a wall is exposed to the outside weather conditions.

We are trying to check what happened as the building is existing, they have
3 chillers installed, with some modifications we are now trialing to run the
store on 1 chiller! The energy demand is now less than 50% of original
design.

What we need to do is explain how to prevent this form occurring again in
the Group, hence we need to show simulation can work on the existing stores,
while auditing their energy consumption.

Does anyone have any experiences they could share.

PS we are based in Indonesia, so the outside conditions are tropical, humid
and hot all year round.

There seems to be some discussion about simulating adiabatic walls in

click on any exterior wall and you will be able to identify that wall as
entirely adiabatic, partially adiabatic (and what portion) or entirely
exterior. This feature has been available in the general release of eQUEST

Unfortunately, this and many other useful features are not well documented

Nate,

Good question.  

The easiest thing to do is not model any heat transfer 
through the adjoining walls at all. This can be done by 
making it adiabatic (I don't think you can do this in 
EQuest) or by putting a bunch of insulation on the outside 
of any thermal mass layers.  Also remember to zero out any 
solar effects for that wall.  You can even completely 
eliminate the adjoining wall from the model but you are 
loosing some thermal mass that way.

Of course the most accurate approach is to actually model 
the adjoining spaces with schedules of operations and set 
points, systems, equipment, etc.. This becomes a problem 
because now those spaces have energy consumption that you 
don't want on your bill. To solve that you can assign 
everything to a meter that you don't use and ignore it.  
The extra effort to do this is usually not worth it since 
any heat transfer benefit from adjacent building cannot be 
counted on.

Please forgive the novice level question.  The EQuest software (and I'm
guessing others) simulates a building as if it were a freestanding
structure.  What is a good strategy to use for simulating a building that is
attached to another building?  Think of a row of buildings in a downtown
setting and the need to model one of the buildings in the middle.  

 

A building in this type of setting wouldn't have a heat loss or gain to the
environment from a neighboring space.  How is this typically handled?

 

Thank you,

The ESL has developed a web-based IECC and 90.1-compliant simulation for Texas as part of our work for EPA to calc NOx emissions reductions. 

You can visit a beta version at "ecalc.tamu.edu". Documentation on the iterations needed for an office building can be found in the 6 ICEBO papers under the "reports" tab of "eslsb5.tamu.edu". 

I look forward to feedback from users.

Carol,

You should be more concerned about the ability of eQuest to incorporate
a "code ruleset" that automatically generates the necessary sizing runs
and baseline models with no user intervention.  Folks in Texas are
trying to do the same thing with DOE2.1e.

My point is as energy professionals we need to embrace these new
technologies and figure out how to incorporate them into our daily work
flow.  As others have mentioned simulation is rarely used by architects
to look at energy use, partly because of the time it takes to create a
useful model.  As Mike Roberts points out, the "drudgery" is finally
being removed from modeling.  

Using newer tools allows me to create more and more complex models with
considerably more zones (double or triple the number).  The more
detailed the model, the better the results, the more I am able to help
designers understand the energy implications of their design, not just
at peak loads but during shoulder and off-peak periods as well.  It's
great showing an architect/engineer that the peak cooling load in a
space occurs on September 30 and not in July.  This information impacts
their final design decisions. 

We need to embrace the fact that we have a unique skill set that design
teams need.  It's great getting paid for building a DOE2.1e model but
it's even better getting paid to help interpret the results of an energy
model so that you can effect the design of a building.       

Happy Holidays and three cheers for defeating drilling in ANWR once
again.

My experience is that the best intentioned and simulated designs quite 
often do not perform as expected due to poor commissioning and poor 
management.  Commissioning and measurement and verification needs to be 
included in the building specifications in order to ensure that good 
designs actually save the energy they are intended to.

EE4 in Canada is a simplified user interface to DOE2.1E that creates the 
reference case model corresponding to the design case model for the 
Canadian Model National Energy Code.  This hugely simplifies the comparison 
of you design to a codified standard.

I look forward to a tool that will provide the same for ASHRAE 90.1 for our 
LEED USGBC projects.

One more voice to chime in.  I think John's comments hit at the heart of the
matter - the more efficient the energy analysis community can be in
delivering decision-making support, especially at the critical time early in
schematic design, the greater the positive impact of our work.  I see tools
for early design stages like GBS ( and Energy-10 that John did not mention)
leveraging (not supplanting) the knowledge and skill of the energy analyst.
These tools put energy and resource issues on the table early and feed into
more detailed studies as the design progresses.  There is always be the need
for quality control in the "art of energy modeling" as provided by the
review and guidance of a knowledgeable analyst.  It's also worth noting the
"flattening world" phenomenon that will require all of us to think about how
our work flows into the design process and how it may be done differently in
the future.

All,

I am happy to see such thoughtful discussions about the possible
ramifications of the Green Building Studio web service. I want to state some
things that I am sure we all know, but I feel they are relevant to the
discussion.

1. Electricity consumption on this planet nearly doubled in the last twenty
years (8->15 Billion kWh) and is forecasted to nearly double in the next
twenty (15->29 Billion kWh). That means electricity consumption will
increase twice as fast the next twenty years as it did the previous twenty
years. This is an enormous amount of growth and will require significant
energy efficient design on the vast majority of new and existing buildings
to curb. Negawatts needed here big time!

2. Over 1,100,000 new buildings are built each year in the US and roughly
three times that amount globally. Conservatively assuming it takes a week to
do a whole building hourly energy analysis (WBEA), it would require over
65,000 simulators to simulate this annual global figure. We number much much
less.

3. Less then 1% of ALL these new buildings use WBEA to inform the most
critical architectural energy-related design decisions (# floors, floor
plate configuration, envelope constructions, natural ventilation,
daylighting, HVAC System class, etc.). Sure, about 15% of non-residential
new construction projects receive WBEA, but it occurs after these critical
decisions have been made.

4. The vast majority of lead architects makes these critical decisions at
early schematic when they select their design scheme. Today, nearly every
architect makes their most important architectural energy-related design
decision (scheme selection) with NO energy use information of their schemes!


The Green Building Studio web service (GBS) is specifically designed to be
used by the lead architect's design team to properly analyze each scheme the
architect is considering and allow all team members (engineer, lighting
designer, simulator, code consultant, etc.) to gain detailed knowledge of
these schemes in their preferred analysis application (GBS, Trace 700,
eQuest, DOE-2, EnergyPlus, Carmel Software, IES VE, etc.) in a fraction of
the time and cost it would normally take. This allows for true integrated
design by the entire design team at a time when it is most critical and cost
effective. It also allows the simulator to provide a much greater value to
the team at the same cost by analyzing more options that can be considered
at such an early stage of the design.

As an open question, how many people have gotten to a project just in time
to find out that there is an enormous amount of glass facing west, the
entitlements have been completed (little chance to modify overhangs/shading
etc) and now the energy expert is trying to mitigate a problem rather than
solve the problem as they could have if there had been a schematic
consideration of energy use/comfort early in the process?

If the number of buildings receiving WBEA at schematic as well as the number
of engineers/simulators providing assistance in these analyses does not
dramatically increase, then GBS has failed in its purpose. GBS is designed
to dramatically increase the number of buildings receiving WBEA AND increase
the demand for a simulators/engineers services.

BTW, we will be releasing version 2 of the Green Building Studio web service
early next year. It will include single-family residential capabilities,
design alternatives (orientation, envelope constructions, glazing type and
amount by orientation, lighting efficacy and controls, and HVAC system
class), user selected building schedules, user entered unit energy costs,
and various other improvements. We will also enable users to download an
EnergyPlus file of their building design as well. The EnergyPlus file is
simulation-ready and includes all surfaces, openings, constructions,
schedules, internal loads, and HVAC compact values.  Several of these
enhancements were from user feedback as well as recommendations from the
Carnegie Mellon study Khee Pho Lam did about a year ago.

Looking forward to seeing this group having a big impact on this planet's
energy future.

Sincerely,

John

Pat,

Thank you for this explanation.  This sounds like a potentially great tool
and I will have to try it out.

I, like others on BLDG SIM, want to see energy analysis incorporated into
the design process so that better buildings will be built.  In fact, this
has been my life's work since 1982 when I was still in engineering school.

The only problem I have with it is that the "drudgery" you speak of is a
large part of how I earn my living, and it does sound like the goal of this
tool is to replace me at some point.  As anyone who has been doing building
simulation for any amount of time knows (my first model was on
DOE2.1c) the up front setting up of the geometry, schedules and
constructions is what takes the most time, therefore paying the energy
engineer the most money (sorry to be so crass).

As far as bringing more experts to the table I have doubts about that too.
I would guess that it will actually bring more people to the table who don't
have experience in energy engineering, which requires a unique set of skills
that cut across many disciplines, but who think since they have the results
from this nifty new tool that they have the answers.

My goal is not to be a wet blanket but to encourage everyone involved to
think this through.  We, the energy professionals, are finally getting the
respect we deserve due to the acceptance of the "green" building movement
but if bad answers get provided which cause bad systems to be installed it
will be like the solar fiasco Brian spoke of and all good experiences could
quickly forgotten.

Happy Holidays everyone!

Carol,

You should be more concerned about the ability of eQuest to incorporate
a "code ruleset" that automatically generates the necessary sizing runs
and baseline models with no user intervention.  Folks in Texas are
trying to do the same thing with DOE2.1e.

My point is as energy professionals we need to embrace these new
technologies and figure out how to incorporate them into our daily work
flow.  As others have mentioned simulation is rarely used by architects
to look at energy use, partly because of the time it takes to create a
useful model.  As Mike Roberts points out, the "drudgery" is finally
being removed from modeling.  

Using newer tools allows me to create more and more complex models with
considerably more zones (double or triple the number).  The more
detailed the model, the better the results, the more I am able to help
designers understand the energy implications of their design, not just
at peak loads but during shoulder and off-peak periods as well.  It's
great showing an architect/engineer that the peak cooling load in a
space occurs on September 30 and not in July.  This information impacts
their final design decisions. 

We need to embrace the fact that we have a unique skill set that design
teams need.  It's great getting paid for building a DOE2.1e model but
it's even better getting paid to help interpret the results of an energy
model so that you can effect the design of a building.       

Happy Holidays and three cheers for defeating drilling in ANWR once
again.

All,

I am happy to see such thoughtful discussions about the possible
ramifications of the Green Building Studio web service. I want to state some
things that I am sure we all know, but I feel they are relevant to the
discussion.

1. Electricity consumption on this planet nearly doubled in the last twenty
years (8->15 Billion kWh) and is forecasted to nearly double in the next
twenty (15->29 Billion kWh). That means electricity consumption will
increase twice as fast the next twenty years as it did the previous twenty
years. This is an enormous amount of growth and will require significant
energy efficient design on the vast majority of new and existing buildings
to curb. Negawatts needed here big time!

2. Over 1,100,000 new buildings are built each year in the US and roughly
three times that amount globally. Conservatively assuming it takes a week to
do a whole building hourly energy analysis (WBEA), it would require over
65,000 simulators to simulate this annual global figure. We number much much
less.

3. Less then 1% of ALL these new buildings use WBEA to inform the most
critical architectural energy-related design decisions (# floors, floor
plate configuration, envelope constructions, natural ventilation,
daylighting, HVAC System class, etc.). Sure, about 15% of non-residential
new construction projects receive WBEA, but it occurs after these critical
decisions have been made.  

4. The vast majority of lead architects makes these critical decisions at
early schematic when they select their design scheme. Today, nearly every
architect makes their most important architectural energy-related design
decision (scheme selection) with NO energy use information of their schemes!


The Green Building Studio web service (GBS) is specifically designed to be
used by the lead architect's design team to properly analyze each scheme the
architect is considering and allow all team members (engineer, lighting
designer, simulator, code consultant, etc.) to gain detailed knowledge of
these schemes in their preferred analysis application (GBS, Trace 700,
eQuest, DOE-2, EnergyPlus, Carmel Software, IES VE, etc.) in a fraction of
the time and cost it would normally take. This allows for true integrated
design by the entire design team at a time when it is most critical and cost
effective. It also allows the simulator to provide a much greater value to
the team at the same cost by analyzing more options that can be considered
at such an early stage of the design. 

As an open question, how many people have gotten to a project just in time
to find out that there is an enormous amount of glass facing west, the
entitlements have been completed (little chance to modify overhangs/shading
etc) and now the energy expert is trying to mitigate a problem rather than
solve the problem as they could have if there had been a schematic
consideration of energy use/comfort early in the process?

If the number of buildings receiving WBEA at schematic as well as the number
of engineers/simulators providing assistance in these analyses does not
dramatically increase, then GBS has failed in its purpose. GBS is designed
to dramatically increase the number of buildings receiving WBEA AND increase
the demand for a simulators/engineers services. 

BTW, we will be releasing version 2 of the Green Building Studio web service
early next year. It will include single-family residential capabilities,
design alternatives (orientation, envelope constructions, glazing type and
amount by orientation, lighting efficacy and controls, and HVAC system
class), user selected building schedules, user entered unit energy costs,
and various other improvements. We will also enable users to download an
EnergyPlus file of their building design as well. The EnergyPlus file is
simulation-ready and includes all surfaces, openings, constructions,
schedules, internal loads, and HVAC compact values.  Several of these
enhancements were from user feedback as well as recommendations from the
Carnegie Mellon study Khee Pho Lam did about a year ago.

Looking forward to seeing this group having a big impact on this planet's
energy future.

Sincerely,

John

Pat,

Thank you for this explanation.  This sounds like a potentially great tool
and I will have to try it out.

I, like others on BLDG SIM, want to see energy analysis incorporated into
the design process so that better buildings will be built.  In fact, this
has been my life's work since 1982 when I was still in engineering school.

The only problem I have with it is that the "drudgery" you speak of is a
large part of how I earn my living, and it does sound like the goal of this
tool is to replace me at some point.  As anyone who has been doing building
simulation for any amount of time knows (my first model was on
DOE2.1c) the up front setting up of the geometry, schedules and
constructions is what takes the most time, therefore paying the energy
engineer the most money (sorry to be so crass).

As far as bringing more experts to the table I have doubts about that too.
I would guess that it will actually bring more people to the table who don't
have experience in energy engineering, which requires a unique set of skills
that cut across many disciplines, but who think since they have the results
from this nifty new tool that they have the answers.

My goal is not to be a wet blanket but to encourage everyone involved to
think this through.  We, the energy professionals, are finally getting the
respect we deserve due to the acceptance of the "green" building movement
but if bad answers get provided which cause bad systems to be installed it
will be like the solar fiasco Brian spoke of and all good experiences could
quickly forgotten.

Happy Holidays everyone!

Carol,

I have been in the energy simulation business since the late '70s and worked
with a lot of different simulation programs.  My current favorite is eQUEST,
partly because if I can get a drawing file, I can import it into eQUEST and
trace the building and zone outlines in an hour or two instead of several
days with some of the older systems.  That allows me to charge less money
for a better model and I enjoy the project more because I spend less time
with the "drudgery" part.  Cheaper models bring me more business.

I have not yet had a chance to look at the Green Building Studio Web
service, but I hope it reduces the "drudgery" even more than eQUEST.  Then I
can do more and even better projects.  I do recall that Trane's TRACE Ultra,
when it first came out around 1990, was easier to use than DOE-2.1E or
BLAST.  Trane also made a significant sales push to get it out to engineers.
In my opinion, three significant things happened:  First, a lot of engineers
became aware of energy simulation and I got more business.  Second, more
than a few engineers thought they could do energy simulation without
spending the time to learn the program because TRACE was now easy to use.  I
got a lot of calls to fix their simulations.  Third, some engineers learned
TRACE and used it, but still called me when they had more simulation or more
complicated simulation than they could handle.

So far, all of the improvements in energy simulation have been positive for
the industry and positive for me.  I fully expect that trend to continue.

Mike Roberts

Pat,

Thank you for this explanation.  This sounds like a potentially great 
tool and I will have to try it out.

I, like others on BLDG SIM, want to see energy analysis incorporated 
into the design process so that better buildings will be built.  In 
fact, this has been my life's work since 1982 when I was still in 
engineering school.

The only problem I have with it is that the "drudgery" you speak of is a 
large part of how I earn my living, and it does sound like the goal of 
this tool is to replace me at some point.  As anyone who has been doing 
building simulation for any amount of time knows (my first model was on 
DOE2.1c) the up front setting up of the geometry, schedules and 
constructions is what takes the most time, therefore paying the energy 
engineer the most money (sorry to be so crass).

As far as bringing more experts to the table I have doubts about that 
too.  I would guess that it will actually bring more people to the table 
who don't have experience in energy engineering, which requires a unique 
set of skills that cut across many disciplines, but who think since they 
have the results from this nifty new tool that they have the answers.

My goal is not to be a wet blanket but to encourage everyone involved to 
think this through.  We, the energy professionals, are finally getting 
the respect we deserve due to the acceptance of the "green" building 
movement but if bad answers get provided which cause bad systems to be 
installed it will be like the solar fiasco Brian spoke of and all good 
experiences could quickly forgotten.

Happy Holidays everyone!

All,

We're excited about the interest in the Green Building Studio web service
that has popped up on BLDG SIM in the last few days.  As the head of the
engineering portion of our firm, I would like to agree with much of what has
been said and clear up a few items.

Green Building Studio, Inc. is a firm that develops software and provides
services related to green building design.  Our Green Building Studio web
service (GBS) is a free web based schematic energy analysis service, funded
by a number of public and utility entities.  The service is designed to
encourage building designers, especially architects, to look at the very
important energy decisions that they are making, whether they know it or
not, at the very earliest stages of schematic and even programmatic design. 

Green Building Studio (the web service) works with the leading CAD BIM and
HVAC design software providers (AutoDesk Revit, ADT and Building Systems and
ArchiCAD 9.0, Trane Trace 700) to provide a high level energy analysis of
schematic designs (using appropriate 90.1 or localized defaults if the
envelope or other building characteristics are unknown).  We do this by
converting a Green Building XML (gbXML) file, created by a CAD/BIM
application, to a simulation model (DOE2 and EnergyPlus) after assigning the
defaults mentioned above where necessary, and running the simulation on our
server and serving up the highest level results to the user (typically an
architect).  In addition, we make the native DOE2.2 file available to the
architect, simulators,  and design team so that they can modify, update and
migrate the file (in text or eQUEST) with the design(s) as they move
forward.  The intent is that MORE experts will be involved in simulating
MORE buildings, not to replace the experts.  We do however want to replace
the 3-sided rulers, reduce the amount of time that it takes to get a
simulation model built so that more time is spent exercising the model,
running parametrics, investigating possibilities and providing valuable
information to owners and design teams early in the process so that
schematic decisions (glazing amount per orientation, rotation of the
building/campus, window shading, system type) can be informed by a schematic
energy analysis.

We changed our name (as of September 1 of this year) to Green Building
Studio, Inc. in order to clarify what we do (Our former name was GeoPraxis,
Inc.) Members of our firm have been working with energy simulation software
for approximately 15 years, we have engineering and analysis staff who do
exactly the type of work as other members of BLDG-SIM.  We want to eliminate
the drudgery associated with building energy simulation, increase its use,
and educate everyone in the process.  If we can do these things (with the
help of many), we will all spend more time on the work we enjoy and that
truly adds value to the design process.

I hope this helps.  I will ask John Kennedy (the president of our firm and
lead developer of Green Building Studio) to weigh in with more information
when he is available.

Pat

Good Morning All-
 
I have not had the opportunity to try the GBS set yet, but I was at a
seminar for it back in September.  As I understand the process and stated
below, there is very little control from the GBS site on detailed inputs.
But, the GBS site is supposed to automatically generate an eQuest input file
(*.inp) that can be downloaded for the energy modeler's use.  This would
save us modelers A LOT of input time just in creating the building while
still allowing us to have the ability to tweak occupancy, schedules and
other pertinent details to our satisfaction and do troubleshooting.  At
least we would have a time-saving starting point??
 
Happy Holidays.

Good dialogue!

Out of curiosity - we actually tried this GBS website - all we did was open
the Revit file (of one of our projects), exported to GBXML and load it into
the geopraxis site. Took all of 10-15 min. The site asks some basic
information about location, project statistics, and energy statistics (you
can enter your own or go with their database of energy costs based on your
zip code) and ran their report. All pretty straightforward.  The project
architect (from the design team) input this himself and forwarded the output
to me for feedback.

The output that we got was not up to par (aware that it depends on what/how
it was input in the first place). Some quick basic observations on the
output summary - 

*	The annual electric/fuel breakdown was missing quite a few
categories. 

*	I am not sure what or how the schedules are input for this building.
It never asked for that input. 

*	The envelope/glazing interpretations were suspect 

*	The cooling load was way off (on the high side)   

The information on the report is a starting point but I am not sure who this
report is exactly meant for. Is it for the architect to interpret and make
changes or is it for the engineer/modeler who interprets the report and
gives his feedback to the architect to make the necessary changes? There is
a lot missing from the process of defining, inputting and getting a
legitimate output that can be troubleshot if something looks amiss, to feel
very confident about it. I mean, even in the most accurate of models there
is a +-5-15% error margin, if not more. In this a lot was unclear to me. It
saved us some time but are we willing to make design/mechanical changes
based on it? Personally, I am more comfortable if the process is under my
control where I can tweak the various inputs and directly see the impacts
that they might have. And I am sure most of us in this 'group' feel the
same.

We will be looking at it more in depth soon.

My two cents - Happy Holidays

Have bldg-sim users seen this yet (sounds too good to be true): 

Teams use their existing computer-aided design systems to communicate a
project's building geometry to the GBS website, which conducts an energy
analysis of the building design. The program enables the design team to look
at the energy impact of early design decisions, compare alternatives, and
share information more broadly with other team members.

 <http://www.bdcnetwork.com/article/CA6281244.html?text=computer>
http://www.bdcnetwork.com/article/CA6281244.html?text=computer 

 

It provides whole building energy analysis using the widely accepted
building analysis program, DOE-2, at no charge to the design team. GBS is
accessed from within the design team's 3D-CAD software.

I have not had the opportunity to try the GBS set yet, but I was at a
seminar for it back in September.  As I understand the process and stated
below, there is very little control from the GBS site on detailed inputs.
But, the GBS site is supposed to automatically generate an eQuest input file
(*.inp) that can be downloaded for the energy modeler's use.  This would
save us modelers A LOT of input time just in creating the building while
still allowing us to have the ability to tweak occupancy, schedules and
other pertinent details to our satisfaction and do troubleshooting.  At
least we would have a time-saving starting point??

Happy Holidays.

  Good dialogue!

  Out of curiosity - we actually tried this GBS website ? all we did was
open the Revit file (of one of our projects), exported to GBXML and load it
into the geopraxis site. Took all of 10-15 min. The site asks some basic
information about location, project statistics, and energy statistics (you
can enter your own or go with their database of energy costs based on your
zip code) and ran their report. All pretty straightforward.  The project
architect (from the design team) input this himself and forwarded the output
to me for feedback.

  The output that we got was not up to par (aware that it depends on
what/how it was input in the first place). Some quick basic observations on
the output summary -

    a.. The annual electric/fuel breakdown was missing quite a few
categories.
    b.. I am not sure what or how the schedules are input for this building.
It never asked for that input.
    c.. The envelope/glazing interpretations were suspect
    d.. The cooling load was way off (on the high side)
  The information on the report is a starting point but I am not sure who
this report is exactly meant for. Is it for the architect to interpret and
make changes or is it for the engineer/modeler who interprets the report and
gives his feedback to the architect to make the necessary changes? There is
a lot missing from the process of defining, inputting and getting a
legitimate output that can be troubleshot if something looks amiss, to feel
very confident about it. I mean, even in the most accurate of models there
is a +-5-15% error margin, if not more. In this a lot was unclear to me. It
saved us some time but are we willing to make design/mechanical changes
based on it? Personally, I am more comfortable if the process is under my
control where I can tweak the various inputs and directly see the impacts
that they might have. And I am sure most of us in this ?group? feel the
same.

  We will be looking at it more in depth soon.

  My two cents ? Happy Holidays

  Have bldg-sim users seen this yet (sounds too good to be true):

  Teams use their existing computer-aided design systems to communicate a
project's building geometry to the GBS website, which conducts an energy
analysis of the building design. The program enables the design team to look
at the energy impact of early design decisions, compare alternatives, and
share information more broadly with other team members.

  It provides whole building energy analysis using the widely accepted

accessed from within the design team?s 3D-CAD software.

I won't add to the numerous emails already sent other than to say the
technical problems in our industry are inconsequential compared to the
communication and education challenges.

Brian's email made me remember a book I read a while back, "Who Owns the
Sun?" by Berman & O'Connor which describes the lobbying, spin-doctoring and
ability of the oil industry to crush what they saw as a threat.  It's a good
read for those who have moments of naievety (sp?) like me.  They may have
set us back 30 years, but as Peter said we will get there.  I just hope it
is quick enough.  Vikram, don't buy property below 30 feet above sea level.

Hi Carol and other Green Designers,

My interest is in transforming building design so that what is called
"Green Design" now is standard practice in the future. Part of that
vision to create expert systems that make it easy to do the right thing
and make it hard to do the wrong thing.  These expert systems need the
input of experienced professionals to create the rule sets, so that what
is modeled matches reality. With increased recognition of the value of
energy efficiency, what is now considered a LEED Silver building today
may the code minimum building in the future.

Ideally architects and engineers are now being trained to be energy
professionals in addition to designing buildings that last, don't fall
down and are sufficiently heated and cooled.  All of these other aspects
of building design place a premium on experienced professionals, surely
the same will be true of energy analyst portion of an architectural or
engineering practice. 

Is anyone really wistful for the good old days when you entered the x, y
and z coordinates of building surfaces?  More people are now able to use
simulation tools and I expect these tools to get better over time.  This
should reduce the time needed to conduct the simulation segment of
energy analysis.  There are still all of the other aspect of being a
energy analyst that others in this list serve have already brought up.
This brings to mind a quote about analysis:

"The purpose of computation is numbers.  The purpose of analysis is
insight."

Happy Holidays!

Jon McHugh, PE, LC

Thank you for your words of encouragement, Vikram, I'll hold off on the
sale.  I, too, am for innovation in our field.  I do get worried,
however, when I hear of technologies and "user friendly" programs that
are designed to make energy analysis "easier" because that can sometimes
mean that the process gets dumber.  While you and I are qualified to
review such innovations and weed out the good from the bad the general
public (which can include architects, engineers and developers) is not. 
  When cost savings get waved under their nose in addition to the
"easier" label it can be hard not to succumb to the temptation and
eliminate the skilled, but costly, energy professional.

think it sounds like a useful tool, but I seriously doubt it will

the ability to run the program (pretty much anyone can do that), but the
ability to analyze the results from the program. Also, useful as it
sounds, I don't think it has the capability to be as interactive as
dealing one on one with a person, and asking project specific questions.

    Hi everbody,
   
  I have just joined this support group.  Currently I am working as a Building Energy consultant for a Montreal firm called GES Technologies inc. Having spent a several yrs in designing air-to-air heat recovery systems, I am in the process of developing a comprehensive program to realistically estimate hourly energy savings relating to sensible air-to-air heat recovery (plate hx and heat pipes for now) that require frost control such as face and bypass and preheat coils (electric or glycol).  
   
  I will be comparing my results and methodology with bldg sim programs including E+, EE4, HAP and others.  I trust I am not re-inventing the wheel (thus spinning my wheels) with this project, but thus far I have not come across such a program. 
   
   I would appreciate hearing from anybody that has any experience or insight into this issue.

This is the challenge! 

How to take something complex and make it understandable by the average design professional, and some day the general public. 

There are so many complex details in building energy simulation and renewable energy simulation that it has taken several generations of dedicated researchers and practioners to figure out just how to simulate somethings correctly.  

Now, as energy costs increase, and as pressure for delivering LEED buildings increases new players are entering a field previously occupied by only a few. Hence, there is a need to continuously educate, certify, and at the same time, develop new models with simplier inferfaces, and more reliable results -- a seemingly impossible task. 

We also need to develop simple touchstones to help with such mundane things as cross-checking, ball-parking, etc. I know from my experience of using DOE-2 for 23 years (yes..I started with cards on a mainframe) that the hardest question to answer is "are my results reasonable..." or more than often "..can I simulate so and so with XYZ program...". These are often hard questions, sometimes requiring super-knowledge from a code-writer who knows the algorithms behind the code. 

So, we must continue to welcome new users without making them feel uncomfortable for asking seemingly obvious questions. We also need to produce readily available self-teaching guides, DVD, etc. To help move this forward. 

For example, IBPSA has produced a super set of PPT slides about simulation that can serve as a foundation for creating a better understanding of what simulation is, how it works, what it does and does not do. We will need more of this sort of thing that gets widely distributed, and lots of hard work, to answer this challenge with a professional response that produces the next generation of high performance, low impact buildings, that are pleasant to view and be in.

One caution--educating "the masses" about the benefits of energy efficiency
is one thing.  Providing access to misinformation, and analysis that leads
to wrong design choices, will only discredit the energy profession.  Witness
the rise of solar technology in the 70's, greatly harmed by the entry of fly
by night solar companies that sold cheap collectors that lasted a year in
the field. One incorrect step forward can cost many correct steps.

Hello everybody,

After reading some of the posts surrounding this thread, I think we are
missing 
the point.  Educating the masses.  In my opinion, that will be the single 
deciding factor for future generations.  As such, ANY way we can educate
will 
help.  One small step forward is still a step in the correct direction.  
Wherever, whatever, whoever...if the word gets out about energy efficient 
buildings then progress is being accomplished.

Just an observation from "the great white north."

Cheers,
Russ

I try and stay out of the many discussions hosted by this fine site, but
this time I have to join in. I support what John says and what Russ is
trying to accomplish. Over the last year or so I get the feeling that
site is being used to teach people the fundamentals of engineering via a
simulation tool. There is nothing to beat 25 years of experience, unless
of course you just happen to be younger than 30 and you don't listen to
old farts, life sucks. But actually using a simulation to design a
buildings system then actually build the building and its systems, that
is an achievement. Of course the chance of that actually happening is
very remote and that's why when you have been in the industry for more
than 25 it might of actually happened once or twice. We are the sex
appeal of the industry these days as the dreaded LEED points providers,
but all this is irrelevant when it comes down to actually contracting
the designs. How many innovative ideas fall prey to value engineering?

We are heading in the right direction, but it is slow and difficult.

One caution--educating "the masses" about the benefits of energy efficiency
is one thing.  Providing access to misinformation, and analysis that leads
to wrong design choices, will only discredit the energy profession.  Witness
the rise of solar technology in the 70's, greatly harmed by the entry of fly
by night solar companies that sold cheap collectors that lasted a year in
the field. One incorrect step forward can cost many correct steps.

either. Or hourly computer energy modeling in 1977 on

Just as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) has existed
under the names Co Generation and even "Total Energy"
(1969), so the Green Building Movement has evolved
from ER-30 downlights. 1st generation T-8 lamps,
original "whinny" variable speed drives, and alaog EMS
systems.

I totally agree that, like the bombers vs. missiles
controversy in national defense, it remains that
energy consultants, by ANY name,need to make sure
simulation results are REAL and POSSIBLE, not
something from a computer's fantasy. A HUMAN needs to
review data to verify its validity.

THAT doesn't come from any degree or title. That comes

Thank you for your words of encouragement, Vikram, I'll hold off on the 
sale.  I, too, am for innovation in our field.  I do get worried, 
however, when I hear of technologies and "user friendly" programs that 
are designed to make energy analysis "easier" because that can sometimes 
mean that the process gets dumber.  While you and I are qualified to 
review such innovations and weed out the good from the bad the general 
public (which can include architects, engineers and developers) is not. 
  When cost savings get waved under their nose in addition to the 
"easier" label it can be hard not to succumb to the temptation and 
eliminate the skilled, but costly, energy professional.

I have never heard of this program but I do have a burning question:
should I sell my home now before the bubble bursts because I am going to
be replaced by a computer program or should I hold off and see how it

Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200512191859.AA5949328pd80000905480@gard.com>


Please excuse the cross-postings...

IBPSA-USA is now accepting abstracts for SimBuild 2006!  Abstracts may be submitted via our website at www.ibpsa.us  Please note that January 31, 2006 is a firm deadline for all abstracts.  See below for more information about SimBuild 2006 including other key deadlines.  




SimBuild 2006

IBPSA-USA will hold its second national conference, August 2-4, 2006 on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The format will be similar to the successful SimBuild 2004 held at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  Technical sessions over two days will feature presentations on a wide range of topics related to the simulation of HVAC equipment, airflow in buildings, energy usage, and the visual and acoustic environment in buildings, as well as demonstrations of simulation software and of hardware and software needed to emulate or measure the performance of buildings.   Friday will be a practitioner day, offering case studies, hands-on software demonstrations and other presentations aimed at giving practicing architects and engineers the information they need to be more informed collaborators with simulation experts.  The practitioner day will be coordinated with local US Green Building Council chapters and affiliates.  Training workshops by various software vendors are being scheduled for the Monday and Tuesday preceding the conference - further details will be announced later. 

The conference registration fees are as follows:

Three-day registration (full conference)        $380
Student registration                            $180
One-day registration for practitioner day       $180 

Conference housing will be offered on campus in dormitories and in nearby hotels.  Single- and double-occupancy dormitory rooms will range in price from about $65 to $110 per night.

The meeting is open to all, world-wide.  Boston is a convenient destination for travelers from major cities in the U.S. and in many other countries.  It is a historic and compact city, easily explored on foot and via public transportation.  Conference participants may want to stay longer and explore New England's mountains and Atlantic coast, from Maine to Connecticut.  MIT has a growing number of architecturally significant buildings that participants can visit, including recent work by Frank Gehry, Steven Holl, and Kevin Roche, and earlier projects by I.M. Pei, Eero Saarinen, and Finnish master Alvar Aalto.   Harvard University and Harvard Square are a short distance away.

Abstracts will be due by January 31, 2006, on topics concerning component- or system-level simulation at any time in a building's life: design, commissioning, and operation.  Papers may focus on development or application of simulation algorithms and software and case studies are particularly welcome.  More information and instructions for submitting abstracts will be posted soon on the IBPSA-USA web site ( www.ibpsa.us).

Key dates:

January 31      abstracts due (firm deadline)
February 15     abstract acceptance
March 31        papers due
April 30        paper reviews provided to authors 
May 31  revised papers due
June 15 final decisions on all papers
August 2-4      SimBuild 2006 conference

Have bldg-sim users seen this yet (sounds too good to be true):

Teams use their existing computer-aided design systems to communicate a
project's building geometry to the GBS website, which conducts an energy
analysis of the building design. The program enables the design team to
look at the energy impact of early design decisions, compare
alternatives, and share information more broadly with other team
members.

http://www.bdcnetwork.com/article/CA6281244.html?text=computer


It provides whole building energy analysis using the widely accepted
building analysis program, DOE-2, at no charge to the design team. GBS
is accessed from within the design team's 3D-CAD software.

I think equest can do simple payback analysis, becasuse you can find ES-C,
EV-A lifecicle report in the result. But I never try , maybe you can find
the detail in DOE manual.

Building Life-Cycle Cost (BLCC) programs 
http://www.eren.doe.gov/femp/techassist/softwaretools/softwaretools.html#
blcc 
The BLCC computer programs conduct economic analyses by evaluating the 
relative cost effectiveness of alternative buildings and building-related 
systems or components. Typically, BLCC is used to evaluate alternative 
designs that have higher initial costs but lower operating-related costs 
over the project life than the lowest-initial-cost design. The BLCC 
software is especially useful for evaluating the costs and benefits of 
energy and water conservation and renewable energy projects.

There is also another good tool for using payback analysis ? BLCC, developed
by NIST. This program has default values for government projects of
inflation rates, discount rates, and fuel escalation factors. It does both
payback analysis and life cycle costing.

I wanted to know if EQUEST has the capability for doing payback analysis. I
was keen to see the impact of using high performance glazing. 

Also, can anybody suggest any other software which has these capabilities?

Thanks

The ultimate solution could be the reversible windows (under research). The concept of the Low-E reversible window is to flip the glass window in winter so the low-E coat will be on the 2nd surfaces and in summer on the 3rd surface ( counting surfaces from inside)

These results are consistent with our simulations, since the low-e reduces useful winter solar heat gain if installed on the 3rd surface, or modeled with SC. To model this more accurately you would need a W5 file for specific northern low-e window, and CWFs.

I am modeling high performance glazing with U=0.14, SC=0.35 and comparing to typical 1" thick insulating low-e glass with U=0.33, SC=0.76.  Climate is midwest US and 86% of the glass is facing north. The north wall is basically all glass and spandrel. Heating is suppied from district steam supply.

Results show increased steam energy consumption from February through September with high performance glazing and less for remaining winter months. HVAC system is VAV with hot water reheat coils.

Overall annual steam energy consumption reduction is very small. I expected to see significant heating energy savings due to increased perimeter R-value. Has anyone modeled high performance glazing and seen similar results?

EnergyPlus Version 1.2.3 Build 31 Now Available

A new version of EnergyPlus (1.2.3 build 31) was
released on December 14, 2005 and is now
available for both the Windows and Linux operating
systems.  You can download v 1.2.3 at no cost
from the EnergyPlus web site: http://www.energyplus.gov.

Why a new version just two months after the last
one?  There are a few cool new features that we
wanted to get out to you and some bug fixes that
we didn't want to leave till Version 1.3 in April 2006.

What's New in EnergyPlus Version 1.2.3 Build 31

A few of the new features include:
    * UFAD (Underfloor Air Distribution) for
interior zones is now available as an alternative
RoomAir option.  (Exterior zones UFAD are planned
for April 2006.)  An example UFAD input file is
available (: 5ZoneSupRetPlenVSATU.idf).
    * Detailed coil models can now be auto-sized.
    * Ventilation improved with the addition of
maximum indoor temperature, minimum/maximum
outdoor temperatures, and maximum windspeed to
help control natural ventilation.

See http://www.energyplus.gov/features.html
for a complete list of new features added in this
and previous versions.

Thanks!

I agree with Mitch & Pasha. Glazing performance is very climate
specific. We did a project in Hawaii where it turned out that single
glazing was more appropriate for the climate than insulated glazing,
because the outdoors was within the comfort zone for most of the year. 

Mark - I would also check if the system is meeting the heating loads
(i.e. - hours outside throttling range). It could be that you aren't
seeing an improvement in performance because of this. I would also check
the LS-C & LS-F reports in the SIM file to look at building peak loads
and annual loads by component, and see if window conductance shows up as
a high value on the heating side. I would think it would.

Mark,

 

This is a fairly common result, and there can be several reasons. The lower
SC, even on the north side, means less beneficial solar gain that would
otherwise offset some of the reheat. Another thing that could be going on is
that there is less beneficial free cooling with the high performance glazing
during mild outdoor conditions (due to the lower U-factor). Therefore, if
you have supply air temperature reset, you may end up with lower supply air
temperatures due to higher cooling loads. That leads to more reheat required
in the zones that are at minimum airflow. As Mitch mentioned in a separate
email, it can be useful to evaluate several options with different
combinations of SC and U-factor to find the optimal combination.

I am modeling high performance glazing with U=0.14, SC=0.35 and comparing to
typical 1" thick insulating low-e glass with U=0.33, SC=0.76.  Climate is
midwest US and 86% of the glass is facing north. The north wall is basically
all glass and spandrel. Heating is suppied from district steam supply.

Results show increased steam energy consumption from February through
September with high performance glazing and less for remaining winter
months. HVAC system is VAV with hot water reheat coils.

Overall annual steam energy consumption reduction is very small. I expected
to see significant heating energy savings due to increased perimeter
R-value. Has anyone modeled high performance glazing and seen similar
results?

When using a "high performance glazing" you need to be careful.  Every
building has a different signature (i.e. different shape, size, occupancy,
climate, etc.)  Therefore, one should be careful to say a "high performance"
glazing is better than a lesser performance glazing.  It is best to model a
wide range of u-values such that you can see which glazing is optimal for
the specific building.  Often, one will see that a manufacturer says it is
"high performance" which it is on its own.  But, couple that with your wall
insulation and the "high performance" wall configuration requires a
different u-value.
 
You will see a point of diminishing return and in many cases a point at
which the lower window u-value coupled with your wall insulation will in
fact cause one load to go up and the other to go down or vice versa,
depending on your climate.  This is also similar in determining when you
have too much or too little insulation.  What "high performance" glazings do
is allow an opportunity to determine what the most cost effective path is,
decreased window u-value or increased wall insulation.  Therefore, one is
able to have several optimization paths.
 
I find it convenient to produce a graphical representation (excel is pretty
easy for this) to graph the variable versus the desired output (energy used
or dollars saved, if a LEED project).
 
I hope this helps.

Dear users,

I am making a comparison between trnsys and energyplus.
In this comparison I am simulating a simple building (two rooms) in free
floating (with infiltration and ventilation constant;with internal gains;
without any plant).
I am using EPW file (Palermo-Puntaraisi).
In transys the temperature of the inside air of every thermal zone has an
increasing course up to around midday and then it decreases.
In Energyplus there are instead two peaks (one toward midday and another in
the late afternoon)
The second peak is anomalous.Which is the cause of this?
I have tried to remove internal gains with schedule or the windows but the
problem  remains.
Can someone help me?

Thanks in advance,

Marino Davide.

Mark & list,
The Trane air conditioning manual has always included a table of
equivalent full load (EFL) cooling hours for a couple of dozen US cities
and a dozen occupancy types (no supermarkets isn't one of them).  If you
have access to this, take a look.  This table was also reproduced in
Parmley's "HVAC Field Manual."  Or if you let me know what city you
need, I'll look it up for you.  I would only use this as a WAG type
value though.

Is data available on equivalent full load (EFL) cooling hours for
commercial facilities based on building type and climate? I am looking
for space cooling information for supermarkets.

Aleka,

Grease contamination is partially minimized by filtering of grease
contamination.  Fisher-Nickel (FSTC PG&E) is doing research of standardizing
of grease removal system.  I have provided a link to the site....They have
done a lot of research on ckv along with ERV on exhaust.

Hope that helps some...

Suneel

  Does anyone know of an example of kitchen exhaust heat recovery or any
research on the topic?  I?m trying to find out if it?s possible considering
the grease contamination in the exhaust.  We heard something about a heat
exchanger made from a duct within a duct for this purpose, but can?t seem to
find any information on it.



  Thanks,

  aleka

My concern is that is over simplifying the process.  It is the build up on
the interior pipe walls that is the concern.  I estimate that the drain pipe
temperature will be 15-25 deg C.  If grease builds up anywhere along this
run, you increase the probability of a drain backup over time.  Draining
warm/hot water minimizes the buildup of grease/dirt.  Removing heat from
exiting water will increase likelyhood of buildup on the draining pipe.

Ultimately you need to consider, pipe length, pipe temperature and water
temperature along with how much heat that is being removed.

I hope my comments are not being seen as negative, but more trying to avoid
a very messy situation down the road.

Cheers
Suneel

  We'll that could be determined. Find out at what temperature grease in
water will solidify then find what temperature differential there would be
between the draining hot water before and after the heat exchanger.

  I'm sure Carmine would know.

Martin, Suneel & sim folk,
As an aside, another energy approach we used with success in Florida in
the early 90's in commercial kitchens is to reduce primary energy used
for domestic hot water, and use heat rejection from a cooling or
refrigeration load to preheat the cold water.

	My concern would be is that if you remove too much heat from the
draining material, the grease component would tend to solidify and over
time could end up clogging the drain after where the heat exchanger

it keeps the grease in a fluid state.
