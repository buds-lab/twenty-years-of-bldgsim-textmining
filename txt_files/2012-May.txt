Francesco,

I don?t believe TRNSYS can model daylighting, but I would email the TRNSYS list to be sure, trnsys-users at cae.wisc.edu.

What we do is model the daylighting using Radiance/Daysim, and then integrate those results into TRNSYS by adjusting the artificial lighting schedule.

In general it is difficult to model ASHRAE 90.1 system types in TRNSYS, but doable. Also, I would discourage you from modeling more than 20-30 zones as it gets cumbersome in TRNSYS.

We typically use TRNSYS to design complex systems, and then adjust other software such as eQuest to match for compliance modeling. Sometimes an exceptional calculation is required when the changes are just too much for eQuest.

Our experience is that model reviewers don?t understand TRNSYS as it doesn?t provide ?canned? reports like TRACE or eQuest that are familiar to them.

Good luck.

Fred

Hello.
I attended a course about TRNSYS v.17 and probably my research group will buy it. Our idea is to use TRNSYS for simulations according to ASHRAE 90.1 annex G (LEED certification refers to that method).
Can TRNSYS v.17 calculate the internal illuminance? It would be useful to model lighting control systems, e.g. if the artificial lighting is switched off when solar lighting provides a determined level of internal illuminance (lux).
Best Regards

Hi Mike,

A long while ago I had a file where only some of the reports were
generated.  I can't remember which ones got left out or even if there was
an error associated with it.  It was one of those ghostly buys.

I think it had something to do with having an input in a greyed-out field
in the HVAC systems dialog that was still filled in from a previous
iteration of the file, but I can't remember exactly.  If you use user
defaults, you might want to go through your inp file and get rid of any
defaults that aren't current.

Francesco,

Yes, you?d have to export the geometry from sketchup into a format that radiance can read such as .3ds.

One concern is that the TRNSYS model won?t have all the internal geometry that Radiance expects such as light shelves, etc. Adjusting geometry within Radiance is very complex as its all based on editing a text file.

Therefore, create a separate copy of your TRNSYS Sketchup model, and then add any objects that have an effect on lighting (trees, other buildings, etc. ). Then export to .3ds so that can be imported into Radiance.

Good luck.

Fred

Hi Fred, Francesco,

You could also use OpenStudio and the SketchUp plugin to create and export Radiance-ready geometry. We are working on Radiance+EnergyPlus integration in OpenStudio now, and the API allows you to write any translator you want; I believe a grad student has already created an OpenStudio --> CONTAM translator. One of the main ideals of the OpenStudio project is the "One Model" concept. You make one model, with all geometry/material/schedule/load assumptions, and at runtime, simulation-specific models are auto-generated on the fly.

We currently have this round-trip capability: OpenStudio-->Radiance-->EnergyPlus-->OpenStudio. The model is created in the SketchUp plugin, is further populated with energy model parameters in the OpenStudio application, the OpenStudio model is converted to a Radiance model, annual daylighting simulation is performed, an electric lighting schedule is generated (from dimming setpoint and occupancy schedules pulled from the OSM), a schedule is injected into  a new OpenStudio model, which can then be run through EnergyPlus via the OpenStudio RunManager application; results can then be viewed in OpenStudio's RunManager application.

Further, Fred's point about internal geometry needed for Radiance is handled with OpenStudio "Interior Partition Surface" objects; these can represent furniture, interior walls, etc. Conversely, we have "Air Wall" constructions which can be applied to thermal zone boundaries that have no actual architectural geometry associated with them. These air walls are not exported to the Radiance model. With these two elements, one can build a model that is faithful to both the EnergyPlus model as well as the Radiance model.

Again, TRNSYS is not directly supported, but the OpenStudio Radiance translators may still be helpful for you in your workflows.

Check it out: openstudio.nrel.gov

Dear Francesco,

The IES VE can do all of this and create the required reports for ASHRAE 90.1 - and all from one model.  You can use our free SketchUp plugin to get the geometry from SketchUp into the VE - or you can create the geometry easily in the VE - run loads, CFD, and more.

I apologize if this sounds like a "sales pitch", but I'm merely trying to point out there are other options that you may find easier than the described workflow in this thread.

If you'd like a demo, I'd be happy to provide one.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] TRNSYS: LIGHTING

Hi Fred, Francesco,

You could also use OpenStudio and the SketchUp plugin to create and export Radiance-ready geometry. We are working on Radiance+EnergyPlus integration in OpenStudio now, and the API allows you to write any translator you want; I believe a grad student has already created an OpenStudio --> CONTAM translator. One of the main ideals of the OpenStudio project is the "One Model" concept. You make one model, with all geometry/material/schedule/load assumptions, and at runtime, simulation-specific models are auto-generated on the fly.

We currently have this round-trip capability: OpenStudio-->Radiance-->EnergyPlus-->OpenStudio. The model is created in the SketchUp plugin, is further populated with energy model parameters in the OpenStudio application, the OpenStudio model is converted to a Radiance model, annual daylighting simulation is performed, an electric lighting schedule is generated (from dimming setpoint and occupancy schedules pulled from the OSM), a schedule is injected into  a new OpenStudio model, which can then be run through EnergyPlus via the OpenStudio RunManager application; results can then be viewed in OpenStudio's RunManager application.

Further, Fred's point about internal geometry needed for Radiance is handled with OpenStudio "Interior Partition Surface" objects; these can represent furniture, interior walls, etc. Conversely, we have "Air Wall" constructions which can be applied to thermal zone boundaries that have no actual architectural geometry associated with them. These air walls are not exported to the Radiance model. With these two elements, one can build a model that is faithful to both the EnergyPlus model as well as the Radiance model.

Again, TRNSYS is not directly supported, but the OpenStudio Radiance translators may still be helpful for you in your workflows.

Francesco,

Yes, you'd have to export the geometry from sketchup into a format that radiance can read such as .3ds.

One concern is that the TRNSYS model won't have all the internal geometry that Radiance expects such as light shelves, etc. Adjusting geometry within Radiance is very complex as its all based on editing a text file.

Therefore, create a separate copy of your TRNSYS Sketchup model, and then add any objects that have an effect on lighting (trees, other buildings, etc. ). Then export to .3ds so that can be imported into Radiance.

Good luck.

Hello Fred

Thank you for your message.

Do you use the same geometrical model for TRNSYS and Radiance, e.g. a model created with Google SketchUp?

Ogg: RE: [Bldg-sim] TRNSYS: LIGHTING
Francesco,

I don't believe TRNSYS can model daylighting, but I would email the TRNSYS list to be sure, trnsys-users at cae.wisc.edu<mailto:trnsys-users at cae.wisc.edu>.

What we do is model the daylighting using Radiance/Daysim, and then integrate those results into TRNSYS by adjusting the artificial lighting schedule.

In general it is difficult to model ASHRAE 90.1 system types in TRNSYS, but doable. Also, I would discourage you from modeling more than 20-30 zones as it gets cumbersome in TRNSYS.

We typically use TRNSYS to design complex systems, and then adjust other software such as eQuest to match for compliance modeling. Sometimes an exceptional calculation is required when the changes are just too much for eQuest.

Our experience is that model reviewers don't understand TRNSYS as it doesn't provide "canned" reports like TRACE or eQuest that are familiar to them.

Good luck.

Fred

Subject: [Bldg-sim] TRNSYS: LIGHTING

Hello.
I attended a course about TRNSYS v.17 and probably my research group will buy it. Our idea is to use TRNSYS for simulations according to ASHRAE 90.1 annex G (LEED certification refers to that method).
Can TRNSYS v.17 calculate the internal illuminance? It would be useful to model lighting control systems, e.g. if the artificial lighting is switched off when solar lighting provides a determined level of internal illuminance (lux).
Best Regards

Francesco and Fred,
   Fred is correct that TRNSYS does not have any built in daylighting 
computation and that importing available daylight schedules from 
Radiance or Daysim would be the best approach. I have used some other 
simplified approaches in TRNSYS but neither was for a LEED model.

   Having managed to navigate the LEED process with about 15 TRNSYS 
models over the years, I would contend that the nature of the building 
and its systems should drive the decision as to whether to use TRNSYS 
for the modeling or whether to opt for another tool. We've worked on 
some projects that relied on more conventional energy efficiency 
measures and felt that TRNSYS was not the right tool to be using. We've 
also worked on LEED projects that had such a highly sophisticated 
proposed HVAC system that there was probably not another tool out there 
that could have been used. I'd be happy to talk more with you offline 
about it but my advice would be to try and let the project choose the 
simulation software.

Best,
  David

About the workshop

The four days workshop is an opportunity to learn how to perform
energy simulation of buildings for LEED and ECBC through hands-on
training on energy simulation tools and case studies. Besides sailing
through the process of building energy simulation up to report
preparation stage, the workshop would also cover fundamental concepts
related to building physics required to utilize these simulation
tools. This course focuses on the skills and knowledge required for
carrying out energy simulations for LEED and ECBC. Some common
questions which will be answered through interactive exercises are:

How much detailing is required for energy modeling
What are the impacts of lighting, internal loads, occupancy schedules
on energy consumption
How to analyze simulation results and propose energy conservation measure (ECMs)
How to rank ECMs on life cycle cost basis

Thanks and regards

Jyotirmay

You can't directly model the water cooled condenser with EE4.  You 
would have to edit the .DOE file and run from the command line.  The 
DOE2.1e Supplement, 3.83 details the water cooled 
condenser.  Available on the PSZ, PVAVS, and PVVT systems.

About ESP-r and tall buildings....

I know of no one who has attempted a super-tall building with ESP-r flow network. I was asked
one time about analysis of stack approaching 800m and my response then and now is that
this is SO FAR beyond the underlying correlations and research that a cautious
approach should include a substantial test and calibration phase. 

The mind-boggling number of leakage points would also be worth considering. Can
we safely ignore some classes of penetrations and facade faults?  Are
crack models in current tools valid for the extreme pressure differences one might
encounter?  It might require some new component representations.

And then there is the non-trivial issue that simulation tools work with single climate
files - over that vertical distance one might reasonably expect there to be
several different weather patterns (temperatures, wind speeds and directions)
and so it might be necessary to adapt tools to deal with multiple sets of boundary
conditions.  And there might be rapid fluctuations, so hourly weather patterns is
unlikely to provide a rich enough set of disturbances.

And most network flow codes assume that air is incompressible. That 'shortcut' helps
the solution and probably does little damage in models of moderate complexity
and it might not be valid in the context of super-tall.

Conceptually it might work and I would say there are a lot of caveats to resolve
and probably a substantial investment needed to be able to confidently approach
such projects.  And the teams that have implemented super tall buildings also
will have skills and methods that us mortals do not....  Not territory for novices.

Is COMIS still active?  How is it used within EnergyPlus? Can it be used to evaluate building pressurization and stack effect infiltration in multiuse (retail, office, hotel with fixed windows and apts at the top with operable windows) tall and super-tall bldgs (ex. 160 storey Burj Khalifa and proposed Jeddah Kingdom Tower)?  Can ESPr and IESVE be used to  evaluate bldg pressurization and stack effect infiltration in super-tall bldgs?  Is CONTAM linked with an energy program?

As I understand it Comis is credited in the e+ documentation and portions
of it appear to be used but the airflow network is largely a new model.
I have heard that some trnsys users use comis still.

Thanks for responses.  A group in Chicago is trying to evaluate air pressures and air movement in tall bldgs.  Burj Khalifa in Dubai is 162 floors and 828 meters tall and the apt floors with operable windows are the top - http://skyscrapercenter.com/dubai/burj-khalifa/  A proposed bldg is going to be taller (1,000 meters?). 

The attached preliminary Excel calculation sheet is my attempt to understand the issues of multi-use (retail, office, hotel, apartments, restaurants, services, etc.) high rise bldg.  I think the analysis should be based on vertical zones by floor usage type and floors served by a mechanical floor.  The air handling systems have to deal with infiltration due to stack effect of the vertical zones that they serve.

I have tried looking at CONTAM but I think it is too detailed for evaluating the performance of tall bldgs as a whole.  I think we need to develop a simpler modeling and simulation system for this purpose which can be linked to energy programs.

Subject 	RE: [Bldg-sim] Tall Bldg Pressurization & Stack Effect

About ESP-r and tall buildings....

I know of no one who has attempted a super-tall building with ESP-r flow network. I was asked
one time about analysis of stack approaching 800m and my response then and now is that
this is SO FAR beyond the underlying correlations and research that a cautious
approach should include a substantial test and calibration phase. 

The mind-boggling number of leakage points would also be worth considering. Can
we safely ignore some classes of penetrations and facade faults? Are
crack models in current tools valid for the extreme pressure differences one might
encounter? It might require some new component representations.

And then there is the non-trivial issue that simulation tools work with single climate
files - over that vertical distance one might reasonably expect there to be
several different weather patterns (temperatures, wind speeds and directions)
and so it might be necessary to adapt tools to deal with multiple sets of boundary
conditions. And there might be rapid fluctuations, so hourly weather patterns is
unlikely to provide a rich enough set of disturbances.

And most network flow codes assume that air is incompressible. That 'shortcut' helps
the solution and probably does little damage in models of moderate complexity
and it might not be valid in the context of super-tall.

Conceptually it might work and I would say there are a lot of caveats to resolve
and probably a substantial investment needed to be able to confidently approach
such projects. And the teams that have implemented super tall buildings also
will have skills and methods that us mortals do not.... Not territory for novices.

COMIS (or parts of it) still seem somewhat active in Europe. EMPA and 
Transsolar built COMIS into a version of the TRNSYS building model. For 
a time, COMIS with a graphical interface was offered as a commercial 
product that could either stand alone or be coupled with the TRNSYS 
building model. Recently EMPA and CSTB, who had been maintaining COMIS 
in Europe decided to go open source with the engine 
(http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/comis/message/982)

As for CONTAM, it can stand alone or be coupled with the TRNSYS building 
model as well.

  David

We will soon be able to offer wind speed and direction at about every 250 M 
of altitude for anywhere if this helps.

PLEASE *RSVP - *Maggie Grise grisem at rpi.edu* *

Only individuals on the RSVP list will be granted passage at the front desk.


*Event Description*

For decades building performance simulation research and tool development
have focused on producing increasingly reliable simulation engines which
are now capable of predicting the physical performance of commonly used
building typologies and technologies. With the growing use of these tools
in practice and education, a new set of requirements is emerging. How can
we make sure that novices are using the tools accurately? Instead of ?just?
getting a performance evaluation at the end of design, how can we use
simulations to give birth to new, environmentally responsive design
solutions? How do we get owners to trust in simulation results?  This
presentation will deal with a series of related projects that demonstrate
how integrated daylight and energy simulations can serve new purposes from
as acting as a form-givers for architecture to providing nuanced
cost estimations for owners at the individual building and neighborhood
scale.

Research
Associate
WelshSchoolof
Architecture
CardiffUniversity
?
The Welsh School of Architecture is seeking to appoint a Research
Associate to work with the Principal Investigator on a research project funded
by EPSRC to develop better outputs from building thermal simulation tools to
improve decision making in the design of low energy buildings.
?
This research proposes to focus on the gap that exists between the
output information from building thermal simulation tools and what is actually
needed for building designers to undertake informed design decisions when
designing energy-efficient low carbon buildings. It aims to generate procedures
to produce post-processed information and data representation systems that are
meaningful to building designers ? consonant with their modus operandi and way
of thinking. These procedures include parameters, indices, diagrammatic and
multimodal ways of representing results as well as possibilities of undertaking
design changes. They will be illustrated by a series of tested and validated
examples developed through interdisciplinary collaboration with the UK Energy
Research Systems Unit (ESRU) and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL).
?
Applicants should have a good degree in a relevant discipline along with
previous experience in conducting and organising research projects in a
relevant field. They should have very good knowledge of building thermal
physics, evidence of architectural practice skills and excellent knowledge of
building design. Good research and analytical skills are essential as are
excellent presentation skills.
?
This post is fixed-term for 12 months.
?
This is a full time position of 35 hours per week.
?
Salary: ?30,122 - ?35,938 per annum (Grade 6).

go into the .doe file and edit the fan schedules there to allow you to
perform this function.

Objet : [Bldg-sim] EE4 - Multiple Weekly Schedules

 

Hello,

 

I?m trying to use three different fan schedules (i.e. Winter/Summer/Fall) in
a model but I?m running into some problems.  I?ve created three weekly
schedules and in the ?Edit Yearly Schedule? window I entered the respective
?Ending Day? and ?Ending Month? but EE4 seems to always choose the schedule
with the highest number of weekly runtime hours and use it for the whole
year.

 

Has anyone else run into this?  Maybe I?m doing something wrong.

 

Thanks,
Aaron

I think the vertical zoning of the air handling and stack pressure  
developed within is a minor consideration compared to the lift shafts  
and stairs.  I haven't worked on anything higher than 40 or so  
floors.  At 162 if you have HR lifts with no transfer floor then the  
stack pressures will be 4 times that of a 40 storey building assuming  
conventional theory. You will get a big draft when doors open and  
close but maybe that isn't a problem.

I don't know if stairs go all the way up these buildings but I assume  
in such buildings stair rises are either split vertically and / or not  
allowed for normal inter floor communication within tenancies.

In my experience (with <50 storeys) the mechanical systems can deal  
with the pressure fluctuations fairly well as the fan curves are  
typically steep so can take a pressure fluctuation with minor changes  
in flow. The issues I assume will be doors manually opened and closed  
that connect a floor with a large vertical void (stair) and trying to  
keep differential pressures below 5 Pa or so so people can actually  
open them.

Would be interesting to hear whether you find this to be a major  
energy problem for the building.  My guess is it will be minor but  
then I have worked in temperate climates.  I think the issues are  
likely to be getting stairs (doors people can open) and lifts to work  
(people not being faced with a stiff breeze as they enter or leave a  
lift car) and that if you manage that then any energy problem goes  
away. The aperture issues Jon refers to will exist but conventional  
theory for steady state conditions should allow you to bound the  
issues (not definitive but informative) and then probably CFD to  
validate conditions in time.  Bulk airflow as Jon has said would  
probably require calibration / validation due to the difference in  
pressures you are likely dealing with.

Interesting topic where we all need to be careful of the limits of  
simulation ...

Graham

FYI. 

Wind speeds at 200+ meters can be complex,especially if there is a shear layer, and/or any sort of terrain variations. 

One suggestion is to see if you can find anyone has done a MM5 model for this location, calibrated to on-site met towers. 

Also, the wind energy folks have a lot riding on this sort of thing and the weather modelers routinely simulate this with their 40 layer wind models. NREL, NCAR and NOAA has a lot of expertise in this as well.  

There are also specialty consultants who do this for a fee, I believe the WMO has lists of respected firms internationally. Within ASHRAE you'd consult TC 4.2. 

Academics in this area include meteorology Depts at Penn State and TAMU for starters.

Thanks for responses.  A group in Chicago is trying to evaluate air 
pressures and air movement in tall bldgs.  Burj Khalifa in Dubai is 162 
floors and 828 meters tall and the apt floors with operable windows are the 
top - http://skyscrapercenter.com/dubai/burj-khalifa/  A proposed bldg is 
going to be taller (1,000 meters?).

The attached preliminary Excel calculation sheet is my attempt to understand 
the issues of multi-use (retail, office, hotel, apartments, restaurants, 
services, etc.) high rise bldg.  I think the analysis should be based on 
vertical zones by floor usage type and floors served by a mechanical floor. 
The air handling systems have to deal with infiltration due to stack effect 
of the vertical zones that they serve.

I have tried looking at CONTAM but I think it is too detailed for evaluating 
the performance of tall bldgs as a whole.  I think we need to develop a 
simpler modeling and simulation system for this purpose which can be linked 
to energy programs.

Subject RE: [Bldg-sim] Tall Bldg Pressurization & Stack Effect

About ESP-r and tall buildings....

I know of no one who has attempted a super-tall building with ESP-r flow 
network. I was asked
one time about analysis of stack approaching 800m and my response then and 
now is that
this is SO FAR beyond the underlying correlations and research that a 
cautious
approach should include a substantial test and calibration phase.

The mind-boggling number of leakage points would also be worth considering. 
Can
we safely ignore some classes of penetrations and facade faults? Are
crack models in current tools valid for the extreme pressure differences one 
might
encounter? It might require some new component representations.

And then there is the non-trivial issue that simulation tools work with 
single climate
files - over that vertical distance one might reasonably expect there to be
several different weather patterns (temperatures, wind speeds and 
directions)
and so it might be necessary to adapt tools to deal with multiple sets of 
boundary
conditions. And there might be rapid fluctuations, so hourly weather 
patterns is
unlikely to provide a rich enough set of disturbances.

And most network flow codes assume that air is incompressible. That 
'shortcut' helps
the solution and probably does little damage in models of moderate 
complexity
and it might not be valid in the context of super-tall.

Conceptually it might work and I would say there are a lot of caveats to 
resolve
and probably a substantial investment needed to be able to confidently 
approach
such projects. And the teams that have implemented super tall buildings also
will have skills and methods that us mortals do not.... Not territory for 
novices.

I believe that others companies like Elioth, Astrance, ELAN...may have some skills in LEED or green building simulation.

Maybe the GenOpters are on the bldg sim forum. 

There is documentation about how to write the GenOpt INI for EnergyPlus but nothing I can find about how to take an INP file made by an eQuest model and run a few global parameters through GenOpt. Any examples anyone can pass along?

On a related note. Is Gene_Arch still an active program? I have read interesting papers written about it.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] A Response & Statement on Energy Modeling Services:
 Meaning and Value
Message-ID: <ECDF361A89E5FA479BE7E64C658B52050D813CCF@SANDBINC4.sbi.smithboucher.com>

I am posting this to multiple lists as it is intended to benefit the broader energy modeling community.  Anyone wishing to respond, disagree, add-to, or otherwise participate in the discussion:  I strongly encourage you to reply to bldg-sim at lists.onebuilding.org<mailto:bldg-sim at lists.onebuilding.org>, where your thoughts will reach the broadest audience.  This message is attached as a .doc file inclusive of formatting, for those who need it.

The following response/statement is a collaborative effort, and represents shared assertions.
A great thanks to both Bill Bishop and Pasha Korber-Gonzalez for their separate efforts off-list to add to this discussion.

A primer:  Some of this is "tough-love."  Where I choose my words candidly, they are backed by my experience and best intentions.  It's my sincere hope Jeremiah and everyone following along will recognize and seize an opportunity learn from this situation, coming away with an improved perspective on our shared profession.  If you haven't seen his query yet, I advise scrolling down to read Jeremiah's post first, as this is largely structured as a direct response and will read easier.


1.       Everything you have bulleted as difficult to have others assemble are items I understand to be gathered by the modeler.  This is critical.  I normally start with at least a full set of construction documents (plans + specs) and load calculations, in whatever state of design they may be:

a.       I do my own lighting takeoffs and lighting control credit calculations using the lighting RCP's, scheduling, and control diagrams.

b.      Thermal blocks are defined and revised as design progresses, typically working directly from the HVAC ductwork layouts to trace boundaries.

c.       Systems are fully understood by carefully studying their control schematics, scheduling and the associated drawings/specs.

d.      Appropriate exterior elevations are gathered for WWR takeoffs.   Spec sections and floor/wall/roof section details typically fully inform envelope/glazing constructions.

e.      Anything which cannot be determined or reasonably assumed after a thorough review of the construction documents is then fair game to ask of the designers.  Asking a series of questions already answered suggests (true or not) a lack of effort to familiarize yourself with the project.

f.        A "fill out this worksheet" approach is something many of us have tried and come to avoid for the same reasons you're struggling with.  Seizing the responsibility to identify & extract required inputs is ultimately a time-saver for everyone, and is an efficient way to place yourself on the same playing field as the design team.  This maximizes face-time spent informing and supporting design decisions.

2.       Where a cooperative designer is willing to put forward their takeoffs/calculations - I will happily take in any such information, but I allot myself time to review those inputs before sticking them in my models.

3.       Energy modelers have a responsibility to influence, support, and engage themselves in the design process as a participating member of the design team.  If you instead structure your services as "a way to find LEED points after design is completed," you have stumbled and fallen behind the starting line.  Your own hard-earned modeling skill set is rendered a meaningless exercise in paper-shuffling courtesy of the USGBC:  a disservice to yourself, your clients, and your energy modeling brethren.

4.       The difficulties inherent with "preliminary baselines" are appreciably difficult to convey - especially to those who do not care to understand.  You however are being paid to be an expert.  To offer evaluative modeling services during design, you must embrace these difficulties and adapt your workflow to meet your clients' needs and pace.  Don't get hung up explaining how complex our job can be at times, especially if nobody's asking!

Some direct advice on the matter:

a.       90.1 baselines are as you say constructed from actual design - wherever the proposed design isn't complete, you are charged with identifying and implementing reasonable assumptions.  I suggest recording and clearly presenting critical assumptions alongside your results for open review - this is a fundamental means of engaging the designers.  Early baselines are always built on assumptions - it's as simple & complex as that.

b.      On the flip side:  Early baselines, in spite of the most intelligent assumptions, can easily bear little resemblance to their final counterparts.  Present early modeling results as design alternative comparisons and in relatives to avoid the deadly trap of others assuming they will apply to the final design.  Example: "These day lighting controls will save approximately 20% in lighting energy consumption relative to occupancy sensors alone.  This equates to approximately 2 LEED points using our current baseline estimate."

5.       Modeling service pricing is a complex and sensitive subject - easily many discussions unto itself - but the three of us are in full agreement on one thing:  $2,500 to cover full LEED energy modeling responsibilities for any size project is VERY much below the mark.

a.       Adding another zero moves you into a closer ballpark for projects of this size and time schedule.  This assumes your services are bringing enough value to the drawing board that "What's the point?" never comes up.

b.      A suggested estimating exercise:  Keep a careful record of how much time you actually spend on this project in total (including data collection, communications, compiling documentation for LEED, researching modeling nuances, responding to commentary from all parties...), then turn to the fee you requested and give thought to what your actual hourly rate turns out to be.  This exercise is often an eye-opener.

c.       Pasha has put forward the following estimate and advice based on the basics you have shared regarding the project's scope:
If I had priced this I would have approached it with this cost logic:  72,000ft2 x $0.20/ft2 = $14,400 / $125/hr billable rate (this is what I charge for my services & experience skill-set) = 115 hours to complete this model scope of work -I then estimate that it will take me an additional 25 hours of work to complete the LEED documentation and review comments.  At an average of 40 hrs /work week, a total of 140 hours of work is approximately 3.5 wks of work.  At this rate, this is the standard amount of time I need to complete everything.  If the client asks for a quick turn-around time on a project I always charge a $5,000 premium.  My standard frame of measure is 4 weeks.  If a client needs a model in less than four weeks from me, it is subject to a $5000 add fee for priority which gives them 1A Priority over all my other commitments.  Any model that is expected in less than 4 weeks is always pushing the limits of quality modeling.   Now---DON'T get me wrong, I'm not saying it always takes me this long to build a model; however I don't give my client anything less than 4 weeks of an expectation for me to deliver anything to them. Of course every project and every client will have their unique scenarios that will dictate how you navigate your projects.  It's a pretty sure bet that you will run into problems of not having information you need for the model and this will inevitably push out your ability to get a model completed on time, which is indicative of Jeremiah's current issue. My final fee, based on what has been shared  for this model, would have been $15,000 standard fee + $5,000 if they wanted the final compliance model and LEED documentation in less than 4 weeks, because it doesn't leave any room to work on any other projects during that time in order to complete all the work they are asking for.

d.      To answer "how much should I charge for my services?" you must eventually consider all of the following:  (1) how much your time is worth, (2) how much time the project will require, and (3) the market value of your services - which should impose both a minimum (what the seller can bear) and maximum (what the buyer will bear) to an acceptable offer.

e.      Pasha also wrote you (and all of us) specific advice on the concept of minimum project time investment.  I follow similar logic and work from a minimum quantity when building my proposals:
Any average sized compliance project should take a minimum of 80 hours based on mine and other colleagues' experience; this is always where to start pricing.  Even the smaller sized building models will still take approx. 80 hours from start to finish because of the idiosyncrasies that we encounter with our simulation tools, discrepancies with project info/ client communication, and time, etc.  Now, what is your skill level & skill-set as an energy modeler?  I'm presuming that Jeremiah is new to this game, based on his questions/comments, so here is some guidance on minimum fees to charge for any energy model:  Try to never offer a LEED Compliance modeling fee lower than $6,000 to a client (and this is really scraping the bottom of the barrel, I suggest not actually lower than $7,500).  This $6,000 fee is based on $75/hour billable rate x 80 hours (absolute minimum time) = $6,000.  If you're doing the model with a quick turnaround time also, I suggest adding another $4-5,000, so you should be looking at a $10,000 fee approx. for a full compliance model in 80 of work done in 2.5 weeks of time right?  Or think of this ----even a $7500 total fee at an hourly rate of $75 = 100 hours of time to do the work = 2.5 weeks.

f.        Nick's personal perception:  I appreciate the logic of "paying" to get your foot in the door to learn & gain experience, but energy consulting as a solo venture seems at best a rocky path to that end.  If your immediate priorities include 'learning the modeling/networking ropes' to a significant degree, permanent employment or a paid internship with an MEP or A/E design firm that can use an extra hand with modeling services is a more economically stable and faster means of building such skill sets and experience.

6.       On the role of defaults/generic inputs for LEED:  This query could quickly blossom into long discussions around ethics, professionalism, quality, etc... The following points intend to address your specific question without venturing into those broader topics:

a.       The degree of accuracy (to reality) appropriate for any energy model or study hinges directly upon the needs of your clients and information available.

b.      Careful review of 90.1 Appendix G and the LEED literature reveal the requisite degree of accuracy (to reality) is relatively low.  Re-stated for clarity:  A significant quantity of generic/default inputs may be acceptable to a LEED reviewer.

c.       This has surfaced before on the lists but bears repeating:  The 90.1 Appendix G Performance Rating Method is fundamentally & necessarily arbitrary, and is not a process structured to predict actual utility bills.  Do not allow your colleagues/clientele to assume otherwise.  Utility bill calibration is something you may choose to offer alongside LEED modeling services, but maintaining this distinction remains important.

d.      Energy modelers have an obligation to utilize all information provided and available, time permitting.  There is a "pencils down" moment to be cognizant of with every project, and your personal skill level will dictate when you must make judgments to prioritize input data available.  If an assumption or generalization must be made (for whatever reason), that is best discussed with your design team to their satisfaction well prior to deadlines.

e.      If 'real-world accuracy' is a marketed or requested feature of your modeling services, be warned this can easily call for tiers of skill & time-commitment well beyond what a set of LEED models demand...  Structure your proposal fees accordingly, and be wary of biting off more than you can chew.

1.       Intermediate modelers:  I advise great caution.

2.       New modelers:  Here be Dragons!  (Run awaaaay!)

3.       Advanced modelers:  Why are you still reading this?  =)


Concluding thoughts:

Hopefully both you and your clients are learning to never offer/solicit services at such undercut rates.  I do empathize with "getting your foot in the door," but when that crosses the line of mis-representing the value or meaning of quality energy modeling services, it creates negative effects we all must bear and overcome as an industry.  The personal ramifications should be clear as well:  Once you have offered a "discount" price, you can never go back and raise your price with that customer...

Again, much thanks to Pasha and Bill for contributing and helping to distill these views into a (hopefully) intelligible statement.  I look forward to hearing other's thoughts!

Subject: [EnergyPlus_Support] Best practices for data collection?



Hello Simulation community.

This request is somewhat vague so please feel free to respond with any comments, questions etc...

I am working on my first LEED project, a 72,000 square foot plastics manufacturing facility and have found the data collection process to be quite difficult.
The mechanical engineer says she does not think detailed modeling is of much value, the architect has expressed that he will not do anything that takes any additional time.

I have created this data collection form, but have not had the best of luck getting them to fill it out: https://docs.google.com/a/cleantechanalytics.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGVMRGdPeDN2Zk9JT1gyMXY1QUplMGc6MA#gid=4

Some of the issues I have had are:

  *   Difficulty explaining the concept of thermal blocks
  *   Difficulty explaining the concept of window to wall ratio
  *   Difficulty explaining the concept of a baseline building being developed from the proposed, specifically they want me to create the baseline first to test their proposed building against.
  *   Difficulty explaining the concept of building area vs space by space lighting compliance paths.
Other questions I have:

  *   I made the mistake of charging a low ($2500) price to get my first project, and wonder what something like this should be worth.
  *   I am being pressured to produce this model in a very fast time-frame, and wonder how long in terms of man hours is reasonable for such a project?
  *   I have been asked to use generic data for much of the proposed building inputs, and it was said that due to my limited experience that I did not understand how to do this where a more experienced modeler would-- I think that some default values are consistently used in modeling but feel that this should be a last resort.

I have purchased all of the ASHRAE books on the subjects, but other recommended reading would be great, specifically if anyone knows of a very simple overview of the minimum requirements that I could share with the project team that would be great..

Lastly, if anyone could let me know if this difficulty in explaining the required processes, or issues with project teams not understanding the concepts behind Energy modeling is the norm, and if anyone has any advise so far as streamlining the data collection process, or explaining the importance of the requirements I would be appreciative..

Your advise is much appreciated and Best regards-

Ground: Annex D of EN ISO 13370

 

Hello. In order to model in a
dynamic simulation software the heat transmission via the ground I tried to
apply in a worksheet ANNEX D ?Application to dynamic simulation programmes? of the
technical standard EN ISO 13370:2007 ?Thermal performance of buildings ? Heat transfer
via the ground?. I got results which I consider strange. 

I attach two graphs. To obtain the
first one I used equation (A.3), for the second one I used equation (A.4).

The values are mean monthly
values. Ti,m is the internal temperature, Te,m is the external air temperature,
Tv,m is the ground temperature (under the slab, 0,5m ground ,and a ?virtual
layer?, whose thermal conductivity was calculated so that the thermal
transmittance is equal to thermal transmittance calculated with paragraph 9 of
that technical standard). 

In my opinion, in winter season the
difference between internal temperature and ground temperature is too small.

Any opinion? Do you know any
alternative method?

If you are interested in having
more information about the method or about my calculation, let me know, please.

Best Regards

Francesco Passerini

Subject: [Bldg-sim] TRNSYS for LEED
Message-ID: <7767130.5217351336755702428.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>


 I have
2 doubts concerning the use of TRNSYS for LEED.

Autosizing.
     The equipment capacities for the baseline building design shall be based
     on sizing runs for each orientation (see G3.1.2.2 and G3.1.2.2.1 of ASHRAE
     90.1:2007). Is "autosizing" equipment capacities according to
     ASHRAE possible with TRNSYS?Compliance
     summaries (Input summaries and output summaries). Does TRNSYS produce compliance
     summaries according to LEED? If the TRNSYS user has to integrate the
     compliance summaries in order to satisfy the LEED standard, does that
     integration require a lot of work?
Best Regards

Subject: [Bldg-sim] EE4 / DOE2.1E - running from the command line
Message-ID: <C7271DBFB4FE0341927D732C2C919ADAF978@BL2PRD0510MB349.namprd05.prod.outlook.com>

A colleague recently had to make some modifications to the DOE2.1E file generated by EE4 for the first time, and I thought I would take the opportunity to send out a quick how-to for others' future reference.  There's loads of good documentation on the doe2.com site for the actual commands and keywords, but I had some initial confusion in getting the right program pointed at the right files.

First, note that this is for an old version of DOE2.  eQuest runs DOE2.2, and that is the more up-to-date version.  But for those Canadians modifying EE4 files, DOE2.1E is the relevant version.

How-To:

1)      Go to DOE21E folder, open WNT-DOS

2)      In the command line that opens, write: DOE21E exent C:\DOE21E\INP\filename weatherfilename

3)      Hit enter, watch the text scroll by (or not, your call) and open the .sim file to view results or the .bdl file to find errors

Things I messed up and want to share:

1)      If your inp file is someplace other than the file path shown above, input that path instead, mine's just an example.

2)      Use the filename only, not filename.inp

3)      Your filename cannot contain spaces

4)      Put your weather file in the WEATHER\PACKED folder

5)      Don't enter the .bin extension for the weather file

6)      You get an .INP file by saving the .DOE file generated by EE4 as filename.inp (ie. Just hit save-as and change the extension)

7)      EE4 outputs air spaces in layer-by-layer construction as AS-0.x00.   DOE21E doesn't recognize that- change it to AL## (where the two # signs are actually specific numbers, see DOE2 BDL summary version 2.1E page 125 for keywords for this.)

8)      You can use the up arrow key to repeat the text in the last line.

Alex & list,

 

Attached is a .pdf describing how to add an hourly report to the .doe (.inp)
files that EE4 generates - and how to run DOE2.1e outside of EE4 as this is
required for the HPNC incentive programs.  

 

The information is very similar to your approach, but I thought it might be
helpful.

 

Regards,

 

Brian

Is anyone familiar with the Collector Test Data inputs for the WATSUN 2009 solar thermal modeling program?  The program asks for 5 "Test Parameter" inputs A through E that relate to the equation, "Q = Area ((A + B dT) Akt H - (C + D dT) dT - E)" with no reference to a testing protocol or information source.  The units for the variables are:  A (dimensionless), B (1/deg C), C (W/m^2/deg C), D (W/m^2/deg C^2), and E (W/m^2).  I haven't been able to find collector data that relates to these inputs.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

It is significantly easier just to use the DOE2 executables that come with EE4. The DOE.bat file in the EE4/DOE folder will run the .DOE file as generated by EE4 without worrying about changing the EE4 defined materials/constructions.

	Meaning and Value
Message-ID: <88D935AFB5F92C4A9C195DFCE3CEA8FA04C006CC@ECHO.corp.henneman.com>

I would like to see an explanation on the approach for estimation of
effort and cost on the various phases throughout a typical project.  The
effort for each stage is fairly easy to establish, but it has been
difficult to account for iterations within the life of the project.  It
may be the case where energy modeling is not given the same
consideration as the design teams when large changes require large
rework effort.  Does anyone have information that could help establish a
fee structure for projects that start early and reoccur throughout the
project phases?  The push for integrated building performance in the
future is forcing building performance simulation and energy management
to the center of design focus.  The original response from Nick, Bill,
and Pasha is a great resource that hopefully gets a lot of attention.

 

Thanks,

The IIBSE IDP_overview.pdf document attached provides a detailed 
framework for planning the energy simulation stages.
We have been using this type of framework, adjusted for the 
requirements of each projects, since 2001.  It is difficult to 
provide a "typical" fee structure as each design team/owner will have 
different goals.
As an example, an averaged sized secondary high school might allow 
for 100 hours for the modeling/reporting for the integrated design 
process from concept through design development to tender phase.

We rarely provide a fee proposal for final LEED modelling until 
project has completed the tender phase.  Too much can change from 
final design to final tender documents.

We provide an estimate at the beginning of the project.  The client 
is welcome to set a different contract for final LEED modelling.

An averaged size secondary high school would take about 100s hour for 
final LEED modelling depending on how much has changed over the 
course of the design process.

The Document attached by Chris is very helpful to "fee path" establishment.
In my case, it?s been very inextricable to develop some fee-way which can
be useful for both, the client an me (I work by myself in modelling), but I
think that always should exist -regardless to ft2 or m2- a "minimum fee
requirement" (for funny, like the LEED prerequisite), and that I used to do.

Thanks.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Openings for research assistants at Plymouth University,
	UK
Message-ID: <D316C48934DDC340AEC96EF223BC53C984C6BD7D45@ILS130.uopnet.plymouth.ac.uk>

Dear Colleagues:


The University of Plymouth has recently been awarded a large EPSRC-funded multi-centre project focusing on visualising energy in buildings to change user behaviour and reduce energy demand. The project is interdisciplinary, bringing together experts from building science, architecture, psychology, visualisation and computing in an effort to transform people's understanding and behaviour through novel energy visualisations using personal and social pervasive digital technologies. Apart from Plymouth University the project includes academic partners in Bath, Birmingham and Newcastle as well as International partners in Canada, the Netherlands and Austria. Links with various industry partners are in place. For this project, we are recruiting four research assistants in total, two in Psychology and two in the Environmental Building Group, to start in September 2012. Our academic partners will advertise their own openings separately.

In the Environmental Building Group, one research assistant will focus on experimental data harvesting, information transfer and visualisation, dealing specifically with sensors, networks and displays (hardware). The other research assistant with focus on the computational side of things, combining building simulation, building information modelling and intelligent search techniques.



Specifics for the first post, hardware/technology, are available at:

http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/files/extranet/docs/JOB/A2537%20Job%20description%20Grade%205.pdf

http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/files/extranet/docs/JOB/A2537%20Job%20Description%20Grade%206.pdf



Specifics for the second post, building simulation/building physics (and hence the key one for people on this list?), are available at:

http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/files/extranet/docs/U_JOBS/A2538%20Job%20Description%20Grade%205.pdf

http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/files/extranet/docs/U_JOBS/A2538%20Job%20Description%20Grade%206.pdf




The research assistants in Psychology will focus on the thorough testing of visualisation principles, applications and interventions in both laboratory and field contexts with a range of human participants and external stakeholders. The aim is to investigate the psychological principles underlying energy literacy, social influence and behaviour change in terms of memory, cognitive processes and motivation.



Specifics for the posts in Psychology can be found att:

Christian,

I am planning a trip to the training in Chicago and am wondering whether to
start out real early from Grand Rapids, MI on the 1st day or get there the
night ahead.  What time will you start?

Also, I want to review the tutorials, but am not able to get the two
working.  Can you help with that?

 

Thanks!

Hi Rohini,

Window does have a large installed library of glass+film combinations. However, if you want to create a combination that is not currently in the library, I believe you will need to use LBNL Optics. The Optics program allows you to combine glass and films and also make laminates. Optics files can then be exported to Window.

I need to reinstall Window so I can't check, but off the top of my head sorting by T-sol (solar transmittance) might be the closest match to SHGC for variables you can sort by.

Good luck!
Alex

Rohini -

 

Alex is correct - there are some glass layers in WINDOW that have films on
them, but if you want to model a film that is not already in the Glass
Library, you need to use Optics to add the film to a glass layer substrate,
then import that new applied film glass layer into the WINDOW Glass Library.
There are detailed instructions about how to do this on our WINDOW Knowledge
Base page under the NFRC section:

 

 <http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/6/W63_faq.html>
http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/6/W63_faq.html

 

And here is a direct link to the PDF file that explains the procedure:

Alex and Robin,
Thanks for the info, I might try the optics route.
Any particular reason why the glass database does not have the SHGC?
Alex, I did use the Tsol initially, but the same Tsol for two glass types
gives different SHGC - so the only way to get the SHGC that I want was to
use the calc function for various glass with similar Tsol, which is quite
tedious.

Thanks again,
-Rohini

Please excuse the cross-posting...and save the date!

The next IBPSA-USA meeting will be held Saturday, June 23rd, in San Antonio, TX (concurrent with the start of the ASHRAE Winter Meeting) - please plan to attend if you are in town!

A business meeting will be held from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. in Room 102B in the Convention Center adjacent to the conference hotel. No registration is required for the business meeting.

The dinner meeting will take place with social hour and registration from 6:30 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. followed by a dinner presentation until 9:00 p.m.

The location and final meeting cost are not yet finalized, although we anticipate the cost to be around $40 as with recent meetings, and the location to be walking distance from the conference hotel.

The past few meetings have been very informative concerning events in the simulation community, and provide a great opportunity to meet fellow building simulators.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the meeting or IBPSA-USA. We'll provide a additional announcements closer to the time of the meeting with the exact location, cost, and speaker details.

IBPSA-USA local chapter leaders - please forward to your membership as well.

As we did for the past meeting in Chicago, we'll have a pre-registration using Eventbright which I encourage you to use if possible.

I am looking for an energy simulation programm that calculate heating and cooling loads,  moisture transport and where natural ventilation can be activated. The software should (if possible) also have a bank for structural steel componenst such as steel joist, decking... or other structural component that are used in high-rise construction.

I use to work with DEROB-LTH (swedish software), but it does not take into account moisture transfer, and I am looking for something more efficient and developped. I was thinking of TRNSYS, Energy plus or ESP-R. Does anyone have other suggestions ordoes anyone has used these software and could tell me if they respond to my criteria?

Thank you

Madeline Leroux, M.Arch

Madeline,
a lot of software might claim to do all these things. But between claiming
and actually providing good estimations is a world of difference. The main
issue is that computational power is not at the level where a building cna
be subdivided in a trillion nodes that can each be calculated
simultaneously. What is the current general approach is that a zone or a
building material is considered as a single node, sometimes the zonal air
is subdivided in multiple nodes.
To give a good estimation regarding your moisture transport I assume it is
crucial to have an accurate calculation of zonal surface temperature. And
that is extremely difficult: transmission in the building structure can
be wel modelled, radiation could (at least theoretically, but of course
things change as soon as the room is furnitured, decorated and people are
using it) and convection is an even bigger problem.

I would start with some recent projects on heat air and moisture transport,
where ESP-r had been coupled to Fluent (If I remember well).  Check for IEA
ECBCS annex 41. I am sure they have done some analysis of available
software and based their selection on potential to perform the task at hand.

Good Luck!

Leen

I received the following response from CanmetENERGY about WATSUN solar collector test data inputs and thought I'd share it with the group to follow up my recent post.

"The equation you refer to Q = Area ((A + B dT) Akt H - (C + D dT) dT - E)  is for glazed collectors where A, B, C, D and E are test parameters, Area is the area of the collector, Akt is the incidence angle modifier, H is the incoming solar radiation, dT is the temperature difference between the collector inlet and ambient air.

Typically, glazed collectors do not require the B & E coefficients (leave them as zero).  If you do not have the second order coefficient D set it to zero as well.

A = Fr (tau alpha)
B = 0
C = Fr UL
D = Fr UL_T
E = 0."

The answer to your question depends a bit on what you mean by moisture transport:

If you mean moisture carried by the air as it moves from one zone to another and from outside to inside 
via infiltration and ventilation ESP-r does this for scheduled zone air flows and for air flows calculated from the 
solution of a flow network.   A flow network can also be used to track contaminates (if additional information is provided).
And you can impose lots of different kinds of control on components within a flow network to approximate
user or automated controls for windows in natural ventilation schemes or hybrid ventilations schemes.

And for utter geeks there is the in-built transient (it adapts wall functions at each time-step for best fit
to changing flow patterns) 3D CFD solver that can have transient moisture or contaminate sources within
it and which can update its boundary conditions at each time-step.  

If you mean moisture transport into and out of constructions within a building, ESP-r will also calculate this
and in validation tests has been seen to be quite close to that predicted by that well advertised application
from the good folk in Germany.  That facility is HEAVY on the geek side. AND the limitation for most people 
is that there is very little in the way of measured data about the dynamic response to moisture events for 
materials.  Without that information even the most clever solver remains unused.

It is quite possible to add in you own preferences for high-rise construction types if you do not find what
you are looking for in the basic distributed databases.  And you can be as explicit as you want - e.g. if
you want to treat ceiling or floor voids explicitly so that you can implement structural cooling schemes
in your zoning as well as constructions and in the flow networks and controls and heat transfer
coefficients.

You did not state the complexity of the models that you hope to work with.  ESP-r does some kinds
of complexity well. Users tend to avoid 'huge models' until they have a strong need and
mature skills.

We view ESP-r as a tool focused on the needs of the research community.  Open and documented
and continually evolving.  Users with strong opinions about the physics can coerce it to do
stuff that is quite eyebrow raising.  Probably two score of PhD thesis have been based on it. Runs on just 
about any computer (not yet on Android).  If what you are trying to do has a research flavor then it has much to 
recommend it. If you just want to apply it in consulting it might be able to handle mixes of design 
ideas that commercial tools do not yet support.  

I used to work with and code DEROB and I view ESP-r as generally more capable and covering more 
analysis domains.  Certainly the development community is larger. Its been used in validation exercises
for longer than most of us can remember.

Dear colleagues,

 

As Olympic fever grabs the UK (and the world!), the Journal of Building
Performance Simulation ( www.tandf.co.uk/journals/TBPS
<http://cibsemail.org/lt.php?c=2157&m=1549&nl=159&s=4831aee3684043012eae
f54c542e4fb7&lid=13044&l=-http--www.tandf.co.uk/journals/TBPS> ) is
putting together a special issue on the topic of Olympic venues (further
details below). If anyone wishes to submit a paper for consideration
(not confined to the UK - any Olympic venue worldwide is fine) please
let the editor know as soon as possible. Thank you.

 "This Special Issue of the Journal of Building Performance Simulation
invites contributions which address the building performance of Olympic
Venues - especially those for London 2012 - across the different
building simulation domains: thermal behaviour (energy and comfort),
ventilation and air flow, lighting, fire and evacuation, acoustics, and
integrated views that combine these domains. Papers are welcome that
address different levels of spatial resolution, covering Olympic
buildings and their components, Olympic sites and the urban environment
beyond these sites. Contributions may cover different levels of
innovation, starting from regular engineering application (fitness for
purpose checks) to more innovative studies that deal with topics such as
urban development and planning, climate change, sustainability and reuse
of facilities after the end of the games."

Please send all abstracts / titles and queries to Pieter De Wilde (

Warm regards,

Joe d'Angelo

I tried to package ESP-r for Debian/Ubuntu a couple of years back, but
after some hours of struggle I hadn't even managed to build most of it
myself, never mind get anywhere close to a useful packaging.
The makefiles seemed to have serious bitrot, and I got the strong
impression no-one outside of Strathclyde had built it for a long time.
I gave up and found something easier to do :-)

Assuming I was inspired to try again, because it does seem like very
useful software, and your comments suggest that it is still actively
developed, would you be a good person to talk to about it?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Short survey: simulating plug load energy use
Message-ID: <CAGbQLLpY8tp0DXMucvKhv0uaBUTLb2Wdfrs6YuZYMB2u0cQn5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,


I am conducting a research study regarding simulated
plug/process/receptacle load use in commercial buildings, and am inviting
feedback from energy modelers regarding their assumptions for plug load
energy use via a brief (9-question) survey here:
http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/G3GQZB8. It should take no more than 10
minutes, and any feedback would be appreciated!


The survey does not require any identifying information, and the results
will be used for academic purposes only. Feel free to forward to colleagues
that are or have been involved with energy modeling of commercial buildings.


For more information about the study, please see below. Let me know if you
have any questions.


Sincerely,


Gwen Fuertes

 This research project is a joint project with the Center for the Built
Environment at U.C. Berkeley and with the cooperation of the U.S. Green
Building Council. One of the goals of this project is to understand how
project teams and energy modelers are simulating the use of plug loads in
LEED energy models. To date, little research has been done to evaluate the
methods and trends of the energy modeling industry in terms of this
particular end use. Since plug loads are becoming one of the most
significant end uses in commercial buildings, understanding the simulated
and actual energy of plug/receptacle loads will help inform owners and
modelers alike on the contribution this has to the total energy use of a
new construction or major renovation project.


Typically, equipment falling into the plug/receptacle load category is out
of the scope of control of a typical whole-building design team, and there
is little information available to the team in the design stage regarding
what specific equipment will be installed. Design teams are frequently left
to estimate the annual receptacle load energy use and peak demand, using
rules of thumb or other standardized/generalized practice. Further research
is needed to determine the accuracy of these rules of thumb as compared to
actual energy use or a more itemized energy projection, and this study may
be a first step towards identifying and describing that potential
discrepancy.


This survey aims to understand how energy modelers estimate this end use.
Additional details regarding the project can be accessed
here<http://cbe.berkeley.edu/partners/2011_apr/5-IAB-actions/Proposal-8-Plugloads04-11.pdf>,

Dear All,

What baseline would you use for a laboratory that is 200,000 sq. feet and 4
stories?  I think it should be Baseline 5, but with electric heat and
reduce outdoor air to 50% during unoccupied periods.  Do you agree?  Have
you submitted a similar project for LEED certification?

Hi all,

I am looking for a clear but comprehensive description of the transfer
functions approach in building simulation. Something I can use as a
starting point for students ...

thanks,

Leen

Basic LEED questions. I am using the Compliance analysis in eQuest o generate the base design and my questions are 
1- Does the base design has to have the same number of zones as the actual design ( the compliance analysis is generating less zones). 
2- The compliance analysis generated R values much higher than what ASHRA E 90.1-2007 calls for. should I manually change them 
Any help will be greatly appreciated 
Thank you

Hi there,


0.       I continue to generally advise against relying on the eQuest LEED compliance features at present.  This feature can be useful for one?s workflow, but only for the sum of modelers willing to carefully review the corresponding guidance that comes with eQuest 3.64.

1.       Strict reading of 90.1 language is the models should match.  If you?re getting at plenum zones however, it could be moot/appropriate for the models to differ in consideration of the system types and their respective return air path behavior.

2.       I haven?t yet) observed completely wrong constructions generated by the compliance feature myself, but can assert my past LEED reviewers have permitted some variance from what?s required/implied for baseline constructions in 90.1.  I feel two competent modelers can come up with different ?correct? interpretations for the same baseline construction.  That said, see point 0.  I would manually revise constructions for compliance.  If they really are way off, it could be productive to share your findings with members of the DOE2 development team (findable through the list archives).


Adding to point 0.:  Your ?should I manually change?? query suggests you may not realize the compliance features of eQuest do not purport to do all work associated with a baseline model.  Review the associated guidelines carefully!  Help > Tutorials and Reference > LEED Analysis

Hello:

Here are a few references that can help from a presentation I just finished for the ACI about the history of heating/cooling load calcs, a fascinating journey over the last 12 months: 

A few hints...

First, to fully appreciate transfer functions you need to read Mackey and Wright, the precursor paper that was written in the 1940s, it introduced the concept of sol-air temperature and included a decrement factor and phase angle.

Then, the most cited papers are Stephenson and Mitalas, Mitalas and Stephenson, and Mitalas, in the 1960s, which built on the earlier work in the 1950s by Brisken and Reque (1956) and Hill (1957). Don't forget at this time that FORTRAN was becoming available, which also played an important role.

The idea of a thermal network came first in 1944 as an undergraduate student project at MIT, followed by the ASHRAE research project by Buchberg on an analog computer at UCLA. 

There were also some great historical papers by Kusuda, Hittle and Sowell, Ayres and Stamper and Shavit that are a must reads. Hittle's PhD thesis is probably the most likely the best single explanation of transfer functions. I'd also read Lockmanhekim, and Cumali for an early appreciation of DOE-1 and DOE-2 family of codes, and of course get your hands on early reports and papers by Klein and Beckman that discuss TRNSYS. 

Radiant time series are the next development after transfer functions (i.e., Spitler). Finally, the RMI preread document also helps in knitting it all together. We also have history reports on our web page and one master diagram in the works as well (i.e., traces simulation algorithms for heating, cooling, lighting, daylighting, passive solar, active solar, PV and inverse models).

Hope this helps.

90.1 requires the baseline to match the proposed model (I normally match exactly, but some variance may be acceptable, as described).  The proposed model should be representative of the actual design (I practice matching exactly again, but Appendix G & the 90.1 Users Manual allow for and contextually encourage some flexibility in ?representation?).  I do not understand fully whether your models are following the standards.

I gather your proposed model was specified with 40 zones and a 10 zone baseline was generated?  I also assume plenums are not central to this difference since you?re still asking after my first reply?  If those speculations are correct, I would personally go back to building a baseline directly from the proposed model as the compliance feature does not sound like it?s behaving for you.

Thank you so much , Nick, for your answer. The LEED compliance gerated enough zones to satisfy ASHDAE 90.1, 2007 ( 10 zones). but the actual design has much more zones ( 40 zones). the question is: will the 10 zones model is considered the base design for LEED or should I use the 40 zone mode with ASHARE 90.1 minimum insulation, HVAC efficiency etc applied to it as the base design.
Thank you again

Hi there,


0.       I continue to generally advise against relying on the eQuest LEED compliance features at present.  This feature can be useful for one?s workflow, but only for the sum of modelers willing to carefully review the corresponding guidance that comes with eQuest 3.64.

1.       Strict reading of 90.1 language is the models should match.  If you?re getting at plenum zones however, it could be moot/appropriate for the models to differ in consideration of the system types and their respective return air path behavior.

2.       I haven?t yet) observed completely wrong constructions generated by the compliance feature myself, but can assert my past LEED reviewers have permitted some variance from what?s required/implied for baseline constructions in 90.1.  I feel two competent modelers can come up with different ?correct? interpretations for the same baseline construction.  That said, see point 0.  I would manually revise constructions for compliance.  If they really are way off, it could be productive to share your findings with members of the DOE2 development team (findable through the list archives).


Adding to point 0.:  Your ?should I manually change?? query suggests you may not realize the compliance features of eQuest do not purport to do all work associated with a baseline model.  Review the associated guidelines carefully!  Help > Tutorials and Reference > LEED Analysis

Hello Hussein,
I agree with Nick. You should have the same number of zones in both models. And at Atelier Ten, we don't use any automatic compliance generators in eQuest.

Good luck,

Good morning energy modelers! 

 

Please join us on June 12 to help kickoff the first meeting of Rocky
Mountain Energy Simulation Engineers (RMESE).  We hope to bring together
the region's modelers over drinks for an evening of networking, sharing
of knowledge, and fun!  

 


For years you may have wondered, like we did, why with all of the
modeling experience and know-how in the area that there wasn't a Rocky
Mountain IBPSA chapter or some other group specifically focused on
energy modeling.  A small group of us have been working for the past few
months to make that thought a reality. Come out on June 12 and help us
make this thing happen!  

 

We will be meeting at Blake Street Tavern in downtown Denver at 6:00 pm
on Tuesday, June 12 for a short presentation and drinks. Blake Street
Tavern is located at 2301 Blake St, Denver, CO 80202. 

 

There will be no cost for your attendance, but an RSVP is required to
reserve space. Please RSVP to Jessie Jones at jjones at rmhgroup.com or
(303)312-4641. This is not invite only- so pass the word on to
coworkers, colleagues, and other industry professionals who may be
interested. 

 

Thank you,

 

Your RMESE Steering Committee:

This is a simple question that I tought of on the gbXML webinar thinking it would be a basic routine on both Bentley?s AECOsim and Autodesk?s Vasari systems, but haven?s found an answer so far. That is:

How can I import EnergyPlus (5, 6 and 7) idf files with all my current modeling information to the environments? From what I have seen there always is a way to start from a gbXML, but how do I go from a "idf" file to a gbXML or straight to AECO or Vasari?

Also, how do I keep compatibility between my AECO / Vasari simulations and a EnergyPlus model?

Ok, but it would make more sense if this capability was buit in on both softwares... specially on AECOsim that uses the EP engine... I surely would like to have all the energyplus power for "freedom" on object settings (specially HVAC and green energy) working in parallel to the better interface and automation offered by the simulation suites. Would that be fair?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] EnergyPlus IDFs, gbXML and Bentley/Autodesk
This is a simple question that I tought of on the gbXML webinar thinking it would be a basic routine on both Bentley?s AECOsim and Autodesk?s Vasari systems, but haven?s found an answer so far. That is:

How can I import EnergyPlus (5, 6 and 7) idf files with all my current modeling information to the environments? From what I have seen there always is a way to start from a gbXML, but how do I go from a "idf" file to a gbXML or straight to AECO or Vasari?

Also, how do I keep compatibility between my AECO / Vasari simulations and a EnergyPlus model?

AECOsim Energy Simulator currently allows user to import HVAC systems from IDFs to start building their HVAC models. We will be implementing more importing capabilities over the next months.  Users have the option of starting with one of the 28 preconfigured HVAC systems in AES and modifying those to match their system configuration.  These preconfigured HVAC systems give users access to all the EnergyPlus inputs required for each system.  Users can also create their own systems and save them for future use.

AES offers three means of creating geometry - Conceptual model (select building and space types, set overall building height, weather location, % glazing, number of stories, draw the outline, select zoning, and HVAC system); 2-D (import floor plans - DGN, DWG, DXF, define rooms); and gbXML (import 3-D model, attribute spaces).

When Energy Simulator starts a simulation, it automatically creates a user-readable IDF in the project directory.

Ok, but it would make more sense if this capability was buit in on both softwares... specially on AECOsim that uses the EP engine... I surely would like to have all the energyplus power for "freedom" on object settings (specially HVAC and green energy) working in parallel to the better interface and automation offered by the simulation suites. Would that be fair?

Dear All,
I registered for the webinar on " How gbXML Works with New Energy
Performance Software from Autodesk and Bentley " but unfortunately missed
it due to its off timing in India. Would it be possible to view the
recording of this webinar?

If available, also direct me to similar recorded webinars.

Many thanks,

With Regards,
Kanagaraj

   - I was sigend up for the webnar, but unfortunately missed the webnaiar
   due to my attendance of the design builder training I was at at the time.
   still very interested in future versions of micro station/E+(ACOSIM) Tho,,
   Once the latest v7.1  iteration ACEOSIM is released I am very excited
   indeed, but have to say the design builder training and software
   are excellent and is the most advanced energy plus interface currently
   available! --  http://www.designbuilderusa.com/

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Your expert opinion is needed!

I'm currently writing my master's thesis on the modeling of desiccant wheels with TRNSYS. About an environment analysis, I would like to find out the critical factors for the modeling. For this I have prepared a short questionnaire (6 questions) and would ask You to answer the questions.

The link to the survey: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SS8K5J9

If  You are interested I can send you the results of my anonymous survey.

Thank you very much for your cooperation!

Best regards,

Oskar Maier on Tinkhof

AECOsim Energy Simulator currently allows user to import HVAC systems from IDFs to start building their HVAC models. We will be implementing more importing capabilities over the next months.  Users have the option of starting with one of the 28 preconfigured HVAC systems in AES and modifying those to match their system configuration.  These preconfigured HVAC systems give users access to all the EnergyPlus inputs required for each system.  Users can also create their own systems and save them for future use.

AES offers three means of creating geometry ? Conceptual model (select building and space types, set overall building height, weather location, % glazing, number of stories, draw the outline, select zoning, and HVAC system); 2-D (import floor plans ? DGN, DWG, DXF, define rooms); and gbXML (import 3-D model, attribute spaces).

When Energy Simulator starts a simulation, it automatically creates a user-readable IDF in the project directory.

Ok, but it would make more sense if this capability was buit in on both softwares? specially on AECOsim that uses the EP engine? I surely would like to have all the energyplus power for ?freedom? on object settings (specially HVAC and green energy) working in parallel to the better interface and automation offered by the simulation suites. Would that be fair?

This is a simple question that I tought of on the gbXML webinar thinking it would be a basic routine on both Bentley?s AECOsim and Autodesk?s Vasari systems, but haven?s found an answer so far. That is:

How can I import EnergyPlus (5, 6 and 7) idf files with all my current modeling information to the environments? From what I have seen there always is a way to start from a gbXML, but how do I go from a ?idf? file to a gbXML or straight to AECO or Vasari?

Also, how do I keep compatibility between my AECO / Vasari simulations and a EnergyPlus model?
