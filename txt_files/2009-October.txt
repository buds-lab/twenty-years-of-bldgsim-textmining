Message-ID: <1FEFED83D386C04BB7CC808AEC2CBA0602D2AFCA@SLICL01EX2.sli.bz>

Hello, 
 
I send few days ago a query concerning a model of a building with DDS and VAV system. 
 
I am sorry to insist but it is crucial for the LEED certification process of this building to manage good results of the Proposed building. 
 
I didn't have so much problem to model the Baseline building model. But concerning the Proposeb building model, it gives me a heating consumption so low that it is impossible that my model is right. 
 
So, I send you the files and I hope someone will find what happen. I check in the Bldg-sim]archives but DDS is not an usual system (because of its price) and I could'nt find any answer. 
 
I really need you help...
 
Thank you

Hi, 
 
I am modelling a new building with a DDS system  for the peripheric zones and a VAV for the internal zones and I have a too low gas consumption for heating.
I tried almost everything but I didn't find what happen.
 
I send you the file. 
 
Thank you for your help.

I just ran it and got the following outputs.

 

1250 therms in January seems about right for a 70,000 square foot building with a 59 degree setback temperature and a boiler heating input ratio of 1.0 and wall/roof U-values approaching 0.03.  

 

By the way, your delta T on your hot water loop is only 10 degrees, which seems low unless you're doing this for a reason.

I have a delta T of 10?C only, because condensing boiler will be installed. 
 
I forgot to tell you that the building is located in Montreal. So, do you still think that the heating consumption is not too low?

Please check your zoning. Unless the model did not load correctly on my machine, I am getting a variety
of small intersecting zones on levels 2 & 3. And check interior wall types (std vs air vs adiabatic).
Also, looks like you are using a heat recovery loop on your chiller. Maybe that helps?

Amandine,
 
I haven't ran the file and looked into possible issues so I'm afraid I can't offer any concrete solutions, but something seemed a little odd with the results.  Based on the screenshot of the end use breakdown it appears that heating represents approx. 10% of the total energy use, which I think is too low for a building in Montreal.  My experience with buildings in a "comparable" Toronto climate is that heating typically represents between 40-60% of the total energy, depending on the efficiency measures.  Are you getting significant unmet heating loads?
 
Also, when simulating buildings with VAV systems I've often seen reheat energy show up in the shoulder seasons and even in the summer, depending on the controls.  However it may be that due to the details of your system and controls, you don't have this issue. 
 
Cheers,

Objet : [Bldg-sim] DDS too low gas consumption in Equest

 

Hi, 

 

I am modelling a new building with a DDS system  for the peripheric zones and a VAV for the internal zones and I have a too low gas consumption for heating.

I tried almost everything but I didn't find what happen.

 

I send you the file. 

 

Thank you for your help.

Hi, I transfer the discussion to the Equest mailing list as asked. 
 
I know that my zoning is not usual but I had to do this because I have exterior floor and I only find this solution. 
 
I will check my interior wall types. 
 
I know that I have a heat recovery loop on my chiller. I try to delete it to see the influence that it has on the energy consumption but as it has to be, the influence is not so important.

Please check your zoning. Unless the model did not load correctly on my machine, I am getting a variety
of small intersecting zones on levels 2 & 3. And check interior wall types (std vs air vs adiabatic).
Also, looks like you are using a heat recovery loop on your chiller. Maybe that helps?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Low heating consumption in Equest

 

Hello, 

 

I send few days ago a query concerning a model of a building with DDS and VAV system. 

 

I am sorry to insist but it is crucial for the LEED certification process of this building to manage good results of the Proposed building. 

 

I didn't have so much problem to model the Baseline building model. But concerning the Proposeb building model, it gives me a heating consumption so low that it is impossible that my model is right. 

 

So, I send you the files and I hope someone will find what happen. I check in the Bldg-sim]archives but DDS is not an usual system (because of its price) and I could'nt find any answer. 

 

I really need you help...

 

Thank you 

Regards

Message-ID: <4ac63261.9613f30a.0790.3fc3@mx.google.com>

Hi there,

Just joined the group and I am glad there are people out there as 
curious about building simulations.

That said, I have a questions regarding getting instantaneous loads 
from DOE2 using eQuest. Here in the University of Texas we are 
currently trying to do a parametric study on effects of varying 
temperature set-point and occupancy. Pretty much we are changing the 
occupancy schedules and set points in the HVAC setup and see what 
happens (for a specific test building).

While we are getting decent HVAC electricity consumption outputs 
(which somewhat fit our expectations), we were not able to get the 
simulated instantaneous loads for a zone... Say if I have a cooling 
zone with the set point changed from 75F to 80F, the increased indoor 
temperature should decrease the conduction load and ultimately reduce 
the energy used for cooling.

We are seeing the energy reduction, but all the "loads" stay the same 
no matter which parameters we are looking at in the report.

I believe I read it somewhere that all the "loads" in DOE2 are design 
loads for a specific building material/weather then they modified for 
the load for set points and occupancy, that's why when there is no 
material changes, the loads stay the same, is that true?


The bottom line is we will need to somehow figure out how much the 
external load reduction is when we adjust set point and occupancy.

Thanks for the help!

James,

There are two sets of loads in DOE-2, in both the LOADS and SYSTEMS 
routines. Make sure you're looking at the SYSTEMS loads, not the LOADS
loads.

Karen,

 

I gave a presentation on this subject  with a member from USGBC and this
exact question was brought up. The answer was to use the local rate for
both systems. LEED/ASHRAE require that the energy rate be the same for
both the baseline and proposed designs. Fuel and electricity rates are
assigned using the local utility rate schedules as they would normally
apply to the building and using the normal ASHRAE and LEED modeling
rules. This line while a little ambiguous means that you should use the
rate that would be applied to the building if it was not connected to
the plant, not the discounted rate that the plant most likely receives. 

 

Thanks

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Simulation of Central Plant for LEED 2.2 EA C1

 

Hi All,

I'm completing a model of a building that is heated by a central campus
steam plant for LEED NC 2.2 EA P1 and C1.  I've followed the guidelines
in "Required Treatment of District Thermal Energy in LEED NC 2.2 and
LEED for Schools" dated May 28, 2008.

I'm doing pretty well, but I'm a bit confused by the following paragraph
(page 8 under the heading: Energy Model Implementation - Energy rates)

Step 2 (Aggregate Building / DES scenario) - in this modeling scenario
the DES-supplied energy is not
modeled as cost-neutral purchased energy, and thus purchased DES rates
(chilled water, steam, hot
water) are ignored. Fuel and electricity rates are assigned using the
local utility rate schedules as they
would normally apply to the building and using the normal ASHRAE and
LEED modeling rules. For
the Baseline Building the rates are applied to the code-compliant
heating or cooling plant as instructed
in Appendix G, and for the Proposed Building the rates are applied to
the virtual plant according to the
actual energy sources used in the upstream DES (electricity, gas, oil,
etc.).

They are a bit unclear...

If the central plant burns #6 oil, do you use the local rate for #6 oil
for the proposed system and the local rate for home heating oil for the
baseline?

OR

do you use the local rate for home heating oil for both?

Has anyone submitted one of these projects yet?

Thanks for your help.

Karen

Is it also safe to say that the eQuest Loads are not the same as the 
loads that would be calculated by a load calculation program (i.e. 
Trane, Carrier, etc.)? The primary differences laying in the way that 
eQuest calculates effective R-Values vs. nominal for assemblies and uses 
a 30-year average weather file rather than degree days. And if I'm not 
mistaken, coincident vs. non-coincident cooling-heating has a role in 
the loads as well.

Joe,

Since we are only novice users here and only using the eQuest as our 
interface, I am not familiar with the DOE2 output file well enough to 
isolate the SYSTEM loads. (any pointers on the file definition will be great).

That said, from what we can tell, the system loads (making sure I am 
not misunderstand you here), such as total cooling coil output, does 
reflect the changes we make. That said, since I am trying to separate 
them out into gains from walls/window, etc, I was looking into the loads side.

I assume there must be some outputs from DOE2 file which eQuest is 
reading from which describe what I am looking for.

Any additional help will be awesome.

thanks everyone

James,

Here is a DOE-list you will need-very useful.

Thanks,
Nikola

Joe,

Since we are only novice users here and only using the eQuest as our 
interface, I am not familiar with the DOE2 output file well enough to 
isolate the SYSTEM loads. (any pointers on the file definition will be great).

That said, from what we can tell, the system loads (making sure I am 
not misunderstand you here), such as total cooling coil output, does 
reflect the changes we make. That said, since I am trying to separate 
them out into gains from walls/window, etc, I was looking into the loads side.

I assume there must be some outputs from DOE2 file which eQuest is 
reading from which describe what I am looking for.

Any additional help will be awesome.

thanks everyone

- James

Thanks Dr. Haberl and Nikola for the info, and it's clear now what 
the DOE2 file definitions are

The big question remains tho:

1. LOADS loads are calculated based on components of the buildings 
(window, wall, roof, etc) and these are design loads
2. SYSTEM loads are summarized loads subjected to the HVAC system, so 
these are "operation" loads

SYSTEM loads are not separate back into components, only total loads 
are present.

So my questions is really whether there is a way for me to break the 
SYSTEM loads back into components?, ie, x% of SYSTEM cooling load for 
month z is from wall conduction, y% is from window radiation, etc.

Is this even doable? hopefully I am making sense to you guys...

thanks!

- James

James,

You can create an hourly report output for this and then sum the results in Excel.  Go to the "projects and site" tab, double click on the hourly report, and add a new block.  Make it look like the picture attached.  Run the model and then go to file>export hourly results.  You will then have a .csv file with the hourly loads. You can also do this for each thermal zone you created.

John,

Thanks for the info, but the procedure you described IS what we have 
been doing. The loads from the report you showed do NOT vary when 
occupancy and set point change, hence the problem. These loads only 
change (from LOADS described from others) when building geometry, 
materials and other building envelope parameters change.

hopefully I am making sense...

thanks

- James

The loads are calculated at a fixed temperature specified by the user
- usually between the heating and cooling setpoint. The loads report
uses this to report all the component breakdown. You might want to
change this temperature - but it is a single value and not a schedule
so probably not very useful in your case.
Not sure how you can have the breakdown at the system level - if you
find something, I will be interested in knowing.

I've been interested in the topic of District Thermal Energy treatment,
as well.  

 

My question concerns Step 1 (Building stand-alone scenario):  In a
campus setting like a hospital, new buildings are typically served by an
existing CEP, and yet the new building is not charged a rate for CHW or
HW.  The USGBC guidance indicates that in this case, "local market rates
as explained in the LEED v2.2 Reference Guide" should be used.  However,
I have not found this data to be readily accessible, nor have I found
guidance in the LEED Reference Guide.  In my most recent project in
Florida, I've been able to find District Chilled Water plants close to
the project site, but it is my understanding that there is not a single
District Hot Water or Steam Plant in the entire state!

 

What do I do in this case?  And where in the LEED Reference Guide is the
"Treatment" referring to?

 

Thanks for your help,

 

Clark Denson

Karen,

 

I gave a presentation on this subject  with a member from USGBC and this
exact question was brought up. The answer was to use the local rate for
both systems. LEED/ASHRAE require that the energy rate be the same for
both the baseline and proposed designs. Fuel and electricity rates are
assigned using the local utility rate schedules as they would normally
apply to the building and using the normal ASHRAE and LEED modeling
rules. This line while a little ambiguous means that you should use the
rate that would be applied to the building if it was not connected to
the plant, not the discounted rate that the plant most likely receives. 

 

Thanks

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Simulation of Central Plant for LEED 2.2 EA C1

 

Hi All,

I'm completing a model of a building that is heated by a central campus
steam plant for LEED NC 2.2 EA P1 and C1.  I've followed the guidelines
in "Required Treatment of District Thermal Energy in LEED NC 2.2 and
LEED for Schools" dated May 28, 2008.

I'm doing pretty well, but I'm a bit confused by the following paragraph
(page 8 under the heading: Energy Model Implementation - Energy rates)

Step 2 (Aggregate Building / DES scenario) - in this modeling scenario
the DES-supplied energy is not
modeled as cost-neutral purchased energy, and thus purchased DES rates
(chilled water, steam, hot
water) are ignored. Fuel and electricity rates are assigned using the
local utility rate schedules as they
would normally apply to the building and using the normal ASHRAE and
LEED modeling rules. For
the Baseline Building the rates are applied to the code-compliant
heating or cooling plant as instructed
in Appendix G, and for the Proposed Building the rates are applied to
the virtual plant according to the
actual energy sources used in the upstream DES (electricity, gas, oil,
etc.).

They are a bit unclear...

If the central plant burns #6 oil, do you use the local rate for #6 oil
for the proposed system and the local rate for home heating oil for the
baseline?

OR

do you use the local rate for home heating oil for both?

Has anyone submitted one of these projects yet?

Thanks for your help.

James,

It's good to see that you're getting a lot of help in answering your
questions. I'm sorry if my original answer was too brief to explain
the situation. Here are some additional thoughts:

1. The differences between LOADS and SYSTEM loads. You can think of
LOADS loads as the heat flows into and out of the space at a user 
defined constant temperature. In SYSTEM, DOE-2 models the effect of
those heat flows, plus the actions of the HVAC system, to determine
the true temperature of the zone and the loads imposed or met by the 
HVAC system. Thus, set point changes will not affect the LOADS loads,
but occupancy changes should have an effect by changing the internal
heat gain from occupants (but not the fresh air amount which is 
considered a SYSTEM action).

2. Deriving the component loads at the SYSTEM level. This is something
I've looked into for many years. As you've mentioned in another e-mail,
component loads are available only for LOADS, since SYSTEM deals only
with the aggregated loads for the entire zone. The component loads in 
LOADS, however, are calculated at the fixed reference temperature, and
not the true zone temperature. You can make a UA-delta T adjustment of 
the LOADS loads for this difference in zone temperature, but this will
still not account for the pick-up loads in the morning, nor tell you 
what to do with those loads when the HVAC system is off.

Clark,
 
I believe the document you are looking for is here:
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176
 
Let me see if I understand your question correctly: you're not certain what energy rate to apply to the steam or hot water used by the new building since there isn't another example of a hot water or steam plant in the state from which to obtain rates?  If that's the case, you don't need to look for rates.  As Seth pointed out and as far as I know you only need to find the local rate for whatever fuel the CEP is using to generate hot water or steam.  If they are using oil, then the local oil rate (likely the commercial rate, not the residential one) would apply. Ultimately, the CEP is consuming some type of fuel to generate thermal energy and the building is modelled as also consuming the same fuel.  I believe the intent of this methodology is to prevent any skewing of results that might arise from the CEP's abilities to use economies of scale to offer lower rates, or conversely charge premiums for capital investment and maintenance.  This ensures that only the efficiency of the building, the CEP and the distribution systems factors into the EAc1 calculation.
 
I hope that answers your question.
 
Cheers,
Luka

Erik,

I don't agree with your assumption that going to a heat balance model
will "make life easier" for James' needs. From my experience, getting
the "component loads" from EnergyPlus is even more difficult than with
DOE-2.  About 8 years ago, there was a DOE project that tried to extract
component loads from EnergyPlus that found the task quite complicated
and convoluted.

In the final analysis, a "component load" is an abstraction,
since the HVAC system is responding to zone-level heat gains or losses
that have built up over many hours.  For example, when the air
conditioner kicks
on in the midmorning, is that "load" due to the solar through the windows,
the lights that came on, or the fresh air supplied over the past three
hours?
On the flip side, when the heating comes on at night in the Fall, is that
"load" attributable only to the cumulative envelope heat losses and how
should it be offset by solar heat gain and internal loads built up during
the day?

These are bookkeeping problems that extend beyond simply switching to
a heat balance model.

Erik,

I've never used ESPr, so my comments refer just to DOE-2 and EnergyPlus.
Both programs use certain simplifications in their modeling of floating
conditions. DOE-2 calculates LOADS at a fixed reference temperature, and
then adjusts those loads in SYSTEMS while solving for the actual zone
temperature. EnergyPlus calculates loads at the zone temperature the
previous time step, and does not "look back" during the system solution.

When I compared the two programs for the California Energy Commission
a couple of years back, I found that EnergyPlus tended to produce lower
morning start-up heating loads. and thus lower annual heating energies,
than DOE-2. At this point, I'm not able to able to say which results
are more accurate.

Joe

Joe,

I am willing to repeat the "complicated and convoluted" process of
defining "component loads" in EPlus. The peak load information that
we have in DOE2 is too important for the design process, that I
really need to have similar information in EPlus.

Is there any documentation/publication that came out of the DOE
project you were talking about? Anything at all that you can share?

Thanks,

Ery

Luka,

 

I believe Seth was addressing utility rates in Step 2, the Aggregate
Building / DES scenario.  In that case, I agree that actual fuel costs
(e.g. electricity and fuel oil) should be used.  However, my question
was in regards to Step 1, when fuel costs associated with cooling and
heating equipment in the existing central energy plant are to be
replaced with costs for "Purchased Energy."  In this case, what Chilled
Water and Hot Water rates should be used, particularly if there is no
nearby District Thermal Energy provider from which to infer "local
market rates?"  Additionally, the USGBC "DTE Treatment" document refers
to the USGBC Reference Guide to answer this question, but I have been
unable to find what part is being referenced.

 

Thanks,

Clark

Clark,

 

I believe the document you are looking for is here:

http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176

 

Let me see if I understand your question correctly: you're not certain
what energy rate to apply to the steam or hot water used by the new
building since there isn't another example of a hot water or steam plant
in the state from which to obtain rates?  If that's the case, you don't
need to look for rates.  As Seth pointed out and as far as I know you
only need to find the local rate for whatever fuel the CEP is using to
generate hot water or steam.  If they are using oil, then the local oil
rate (likely the commercial rate, not the residential one) would apply.
Ultimately, the CEP is consuming some type of fuel to generate thermal
energy and the building is modelled as also consuming the same fuel.  I
believe the intent of this methodology is to prevent any skewing of
results that might arise from the CEP's abilities to use economies of
scale to offer lower rates, or conversely charge premiums for capital
investment and maintenance.  This ensures that only the efficiency of
the building, the CEP and the distribution systems factors into the EAc1
calculation.

 

I hope that answers your question.

 

Cheers,

Luka

I've been interested in the topic of District Thermal Energy treatment,
as well.  

 

My question concerns Step 1 (Building stand-alone scenario):  In a
campus setting like a hospital, new buildings are typically served by an
existing CEP, and yet the new building is not charged a rate for CHW or
HW.  The USGBC guidance indicates that in this case, "local market rates
as explained in the LEED v2.2 Reference Guide" should be used.  However,
I have not found this data to be readily accessible, nor have I found
guidance in the LEED Reference Guide.  In my most recent project in
Florida, I've been able to find District Chilled Water plants close to
the project site, but it is my understanding that there is not a single
District Hot Water or Steam Plant in the entire state!

 

What do I do in this case?  And where in the LEED Reference Guide is the
"Treatment" referring to?

 

Thanks for your help,

Karen,

 

I gave a presentation on this subject  with a member from USGBC and this
exact question was brought up. The answer was to use the local rate for
both systems. LEED/ASHRAE require that the energy rate be the same for
both the baseline and proposed designs. Fuel and electricity rates are
assigned using the local utility rate schedules as they would normally
apply to the building and using the normal ASHRAE and LEED modeling
rules. This line while a little ambiguous means that you should use the
rate that would be applied to the building if it was not connected to
the plant, not the discounted rate that the plant most likely receives. 

 

Thanks

Hi All,

I'm completing a model of a building that is heated by a central campus
steam plant for LEED NC 2.2 EA P1 and C1.  I've followed the guidelines
in "Required Treatment of District Thermal Energy in LEED NC 2.2 and
LEED for Schools" dated May 28, 2008.

I'm doing pretty well, but I'm a bit confused by the following paragraph
(page 8 under the heading: Energy Model Implementation - Energy rates)

Step 2 (Aggregate Building / DES scenario) - in this modeling scenario
the DES-supplied energy is not
modeled as cost-neutral purchased energy, and thus purchased DES rates
(chilled water, steam, hot
water) are ignored. Fuel and electricity rates are assigned using the
local utility rate schedules as they
would normally apply to the building and using the normal ASHRAE and
LEED modeling rules. For
the Baseline Building the rates are applied to the code-compliant
heating or cooling plant as instructed
in Appendix G, and for the Proposed Building the rates are applied to
the virtual plant according to the
actual energy sources used in the upstream DES (electricity, gas, oil,
etc.).

They are a bit unclear...

If the central plant burns #6 oil, do you use the local rate for #6 oil
for the proposed system and the local rate for home heating oil for the
baseline?

OR

do you use the local rate for home heating oil for both?

Has anyone submitted one of these projects yet?

Thanks for your help.

Clark,

 

I encountered this situation once and was told to use the default energy
rate within eQuest. The project did get certified however it was before
the DES Guideline document was released when only step one was required.

 

The other option is to look into calculating the cost of the thermal
energy which is most likely not a part of your fee. This is a huge
market that DES companies are starting to realize they need in order to
have LEED buildings connect to their systems.

 

Thanks

I believe Energy Star just needs metered consumption of each energy stream to the building regardless of the energy type (grid elec, on site pv elec, nat. gas, hot water, chilled water, etc).

The rating is really based on source energy use intensity and all projects use the source to site ratios they specify (http://www.energystar.gov/ia/business/evaluate_performance/site_source.pdf).

Tangentially, if anyone is interested in the 1:1 ratio for On Site Solar and Wind generated electricity read http://www.energystar.gov/ia/business/evaluate_performance/RenewableEnergyFAQs.pdf.

Can anyone enlighten me as to why eQUEST isn't on the approved IRS software
list for calculating commercial building tax deductions?

 

We have a client that is about to remodel their building with an approved
software package, which is an extreme waste of limited modeling resources. 

Seems like it might be cheaper for them to pay for the approval process. Or
get some other to pitch in.

Hello,

I would like to assess whether a HVAC system is compliance with ASHRAE
90.1-2004 minimum requirements, but I am unable to decide which table to
use for efficiency. The equipments in question are fan coils, but I don't
understand which table entry in ASHRAE 90.1 Tables 6.8.1 correspond to
this kind of equipment. This is a project striving for LEED-CI, and
fan-coils are the only equipment installed during tenant fit-out.

Thank you,

Dear All,

Following up on the previous e-mail, I am considering doing a modelling of
this single floor office for LEED CI rating. The office is climatised with
a four-pipe fan coil system supplied with fresh air by a single AHU. What
steps would you recommend I follow? I have to use the Energy Cost Budget
Method and the simulation will be done for this.

Wes, 

 

You should take a look at the IES <Virtual Environment>. It will link
into Revit, both Architecture and MEP by using a plug-in. The toolkit
within the plug-in can be used to assess building energy performance
early stage, along with loads, daylighting, solar shading and some
aspects of LEED analysis. The Revit model can then be imported into the
<Virtual Environment> for more detailed studies like assessing
lightshelves for daylighting, double skin facades,  advanced solar
shading, comfort assessments and CFD analyses to gauge the impact of
both natural and mechanical ventilation strategies. More information can
be found at www.iesve.com where you can download a trial of the <VE> for
30 days.

 

Hope this helps

 

Pete

Wes,

 

I recommend you take a look at Tas, which has support for importing
REVIT gbXML data. You can either import a building directly to the
analysis stage or convert it to a Tas 3D model first, which gives you
the option to make any changes for analysis. The lead developer of the
Tas 3D Modeller has worked directly with REVIT to ensure that the two
products link together properly, so you can be sure that Tas will
perform well with a REVIT model and vice-versa.

 

You can download Tas for an 8-week trial at www.edsl.net
<http://www.edsl.net/> . There's also a video (with voiceover)
demonstrating a REVIT gbXML import and simulation at 
http://www.edsl.myzen.co.uk/downloads/videos/gbxml.htm.

Message-ID: <c53178e80910081210q7f33d4a5gef1d5e86f058a69b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am a graduate student working on a project studying the effect of louvers
on natural ventilation with respect to air movement, distribution, velocity,
temperature and the effect on thermal comfort. At the moment, I am looking
at pressure driven ventilation.

I need to do CFD modeling to be able to see the air movement through the
louvers. Then change one variable each time to study the changes in effect
produced.

I started using Design Builder CFD for the same. I am not able to model the
louvered window for the CDF analysis. Is anyone has done this exercise,
could you suggest an effective way to model a louvered window. Is there any
other free tool that I could use for this exercise?


Thank you in advance,

Deepa Chandrashekaran

You need to us Autodesk's Green Building Studio. 

 

You export a gbxml file out of Revit into GBS, and then an INP file out
of GBS.

 

A caution here - it's not as simple as it sounds. We are finding that
most Revit models have too much information to be useful once they are
past the DD phase. Very often it's easier to build from scratch in the
wizard than it is to 'dumb down' the Revit model for export.

Deepa

You could set up DesignBuilder to run the energy plus simulations with  
variation in flow exponent which would equate to differences and model  
dynamically as bulk air flow to get the rates that you then put into a  
CFD model and solution by linking the results to the CFD model.

Alternatively to study the flow across the blades you could create  
them as an assembly then create an external airflow model to just  
study the isothermal airflow.

Other alternatives include NIST via pyrosim or openfoam both of which  
are complex tools which will more than adequately do what you are  
trying to do. Are you comparing them with empirical data? If so you  
need a tool that can give you cell data really or at least that's  
probably how it should be done.

Dear Wes,

 

We currently use IES for running analysis on our major projects from
Concept Design to Contract Documentation using IES (the full suite). I
find it extremely useful during the early stages of design to determine
the GreenStar, Australian LEED equivalent, achievements of multiple
designs. It is very quick in its, early design stages, results and is an
accepted software analysis as per ASHRAE requirements.

 

During the final stage of design, its downfall is the calculation time
for daylight analysis. The software also has no water analytical
modelling, as where EnergyPlus does. This can be a downfall where you
have large water chillers. However, the calculation time for doing
energy analysis is fast. I have found that the software does all that we
require of it, from PID control of multiple HVAC room components to
comfort analysis. 

 

Our company has benefited from purchasing this software in it's
deliverance of GreenStar submissions and additional analysis within a
niche market. IES has just released version 6 of its suite (yet to get
my hands on it) and I'm quite excited to use it. I find the IES company
very helpful and they do try to answer all of our questions, usually by
a rep ringing us back within minutes. 

 

I've used EnergyPlus but find that it is not great in a Revit
environment. Hopefully EnergyPlus will bring back its IFC functionality
and we may revisit testing the software. We also use ArchiCad. To do our
energy, thermal and CFD analysis of our ArchiCad models, we export IFC
to Revit and gbXML to IES. It works quite well for us and I do it on a
weekly basis. However much testing was required. 

 

>From a learning point of view, IES takes approx one week to familiarise
yourself with, after that you'll notice its advantages. 

 

I've not tested TAS or Equest and would also like to hear of other
people's detailed comments on the software to help me persuade my
seniors to acquire a copy for testing in our Revit/ArchiCad environment.

Dear prospective PhD candidate

I would like to bring your attention to two full time PhD Knowledge Economy
Skills Scholarships being offered at UWIC, which are partly funded by the
European Social Fund Convergence Programme (West Wales and the Valleys). One
project (listed as project two on the link below) is related to the
'Assessment of the construction process and thermal performance of Low
Carbon Dwellings' and the second project (listed as project three on the
link below) is related to 'Low Carbon Dwelling Design'.

Each PhD scholarship provides an annual stipend of ?13,290 p.a. for three
years in addition to ?5200 p.a. to cover travel, equipment, conference
costs, consumables, training etc.

Each PhD project is also part funded by one industrial partner (both
partners are housing associations operating in South Wales) based within the
convergence areas of Wales and the project will involve working with this
partner on the PhD project. Both projects will be supervised by staff from
the Ecological Built Environment Research and Enterprise Group (EBERE) at
UWIC. The closing date for applications is 12 October.

For a student to be eligible for a KESS award they must be resident in the
Convergence area in Wales on registration and they must be able to take paid
employment in the Convergence area in Wales on completion of the
scholarship, which includes:

Isle of Anglesey;
Carmarthenshire;
Rhondda Cynon Taff;
Gwynedd;
Pembrokeshire;
Caerphilly;
Conwy;
Swansea;
Torfean;
Denbighshire;
Neath Port Talbot;
Ceredigion;
Bridgend;

The industrial partner for project two is Coastal Housing Group (CHG), whom
are based in Swansea and whom operate in Swansea and Neath Port Talbot. This
project will also involve collaborating with Pembrokeshire Housing
Association and Valleys 2 Coast Housing Association, on a series of
residential schemes spread across some of the conversion areas. In addition,
it may involve collaborating with the PhD student working on KESS project
two.
The student will based for a minimum of one month per year (spread
throughout the year/or one block) in CHG's office in Swansea and will also
travel (the student will expected to have a clean UK driving licence) to
Bridgend, Neath Port Talbot and Pembrokeshire.

The industrial partner for project three is United Welsh Housing Association
(UWHA), whom are based in Caerphilly and whom operate in Caerphilly and
Torfaen. This project will also involve collaborating with Pembrokeshire
Housing Association and Valleys 2 Coast Housing Association, on  series of
residential schemes spread across some of the conversion areas.
The student will based for a minimum of one month per year (spread

Hello - I downloaded and installed eQuest 3.63b.  Later I opened up a
project file that had been created in 3.63b by someone else and was having
no problems until eQuest crashed (which it seems to do without provocation).
Now, I can't open up eQuest because it wants a Software Registration Code
and it won't accept random numbers.  So, I tried to open eQuest 3.6 and I
got the same message.  I even went into the project folder and clicked on
the .pd2 file and still got the same message.  So now I can't open up any
equest software.  I even shut down my computer and started it up again, no
change.  I am at a loss.  Any help would be appreciated.

Message-ID: <927a3ea80910091246l535f7b5eq8d8ce2659aea9c3c@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

I've noticed a slight heat loss through glazed surfaces during the whole
year. I'm usind DesignBuilder and the situation is the following:
1) climate: Brasilia (Brazil). Average temperatures around 22?C, but during
occupied periods (daytimes) the temperatures are higher (around 26?C). Solar
radiation is considerable.
2) Conditioned zone with 24?C set point temperature
3) Using a single pane glass 3mm (SHGF around 89%) form the EnergyPlus
dataset.

I wonder why the zone is losing heat through glazing even when internal
temperatures are lower than external (conditioned zone). Heat gains due to
solar radiation are ok, but I'm not sure the glazing results are fine. The
interesting thing is that the zone never gains heat from the glazing (except
due to solar radiation).

Is this a common thing? Any thoughts?

Thanks in advance,
Raoni

Thanks in advance for any help.

1. I am trying to model a York heat recovery chiller for a lab facility
and one of the options on the table is adding a second injection rig to
boost the heat recovery capacity of the chiller. When I set the controls
and temperatures for a single rig, it operates closely to what my hand
calcs show for three months of operation in heat recovery mode. However,
I don't know how to boost the heating capacity in heating mode to
simulate the second rig. The heating capacity seems to be limited by the
cooling capacity. Do I need to do hand calcs and provide an exceptional
calculation which accounts for the derated chiller performance and
recovered heat? Any thoughts?

2. For the same lab, the baseline and proposed systems are 100% OA VAV
reheat. After all efficiency measures are included, the total system CFM
for the proposed model is 50,000 CFM less than the proposed, and because
it is a 100% OA system, the baseline system is providing an additional
50,000 CFM of outdoor air. Per ASHRAE G.3.1.2.5, the minimum ventilation
rates shall be the same, but changing the baseline model fundamentally
changes the way a 100% OA lab system is designed to work. If 100% OA is
not provided, then some amount of recirculation is assumed, and for labs
handling sensitive testing and materials, recirculation is not allowed
under any circumstance. Is there a CIR or addenda regarding this issue
in lab modeling? Any thoughts or experience are greatly appreciated.

I am going to touch on a couple issues that haven't been mentioned yet. 

 

First let me start off by saying that 3rd party software representatives
replying to this thread saying their software works great makes me
cringe a little bit, so any recommendations in that regards should be
taken with a grain of salt. 

 

The underlying issue here is whether or not BIM models should even be
linked to energy models at all. I have done extensive research on the
topic you have brought up and ultimately come to the conclusion that at
this point in time BIM models and their relative analytical loads model
should be independent of any energy modeling that needs to be done
either for code compliance, LEED documentation, LCC etc.  (Just one
thing. The integration of heating and cooling loads inside BIM models is
absolutely amazing and the parametric workflow in Revit works flawlessly
such as auto resizing of outlets, terminals and equipment so I don't
want to confuse the two here)

 

The issue is this. The typical workflow of energy modeling is that
architects define the geometry, programmatic layout and material
selection at which point the building is handed over to the engineers
who design the system and usually also perform the energy modeling do
the complexity of modeling MEP building energy and water systems. The
problem with this workflow is that the geometry, program and materials
are constantly changing and the links from BIM to GBXML or IFC and then
to the energy modeling software is not parametric. Changes that are made
architecturally are not easily integrated into a pre-existing energy
model. Things get deleted and move around and your systems will need to
be re-defined and that's even if the software supports GBXML
"re-importing".

 

The other issue is defining the zones themselves. This is almost
entirely controlled by the architect. In Revit room bounding objects are
controlled by the architect. The ability to merge rooms in into one
thermal zone is an extra step. In fact the whole creation of spaces and
zones is a step that has to be taken, which really means if you are
going to have to fiddle with room bounding objects like walls and
ceiling and the splitting of perimeter zones with space partitions why
not do it from scratch. The geometry portion of an energy model is the
quickest step anyway, (usually). 

 

Then there is the issue of whether or not the software you have used for
years can accept GBXML or IFC and if so how clean does It get imported?
So you may be forced to learn new software (IES or TAS) which may not
even model some important systems like the water-side components or CHP
and power generation as accurately as your tried and true DOE based
software, E+, etc. 

 

I am leaving out a lot here, but you get the point. This isn't cut and
dry and you may find its best to stick with HAP or whatever you are
comfortable using until these issues can get resolved to ultimately
provide a more flexible and parametric workflow. 

 

On the positive side, GBS is a great tool though if you want rough
estimates (SD) on energy use without the detail that other software
provides. It is quick to set up and test ECM scenarios. IES also has
similar "SD" level tools in their IES-Toolkits which offer good early
level analysis components.

Sam,
We've been modeling many complex / unusual situations like yours. In some
models our efficiencies come out great (high 30%s). Of course after looking
for CIRs, just put together all your documentation, wrap it up and send it
to the USGBC (it seemed like you were describing a LEED project). You'll
have two reviews, a design review after which you can answer questions /
modify design, and then a construction review. Key is to describe any and
every question you think they can ask you about the design and be sure to
write narratives in a manner that a person that doesn't know the project
can understand.

Additionally there's a section in 90.1 section 2.5, "This standard shall
not be used to circumvent any safety, health, or environmental
requirements." and 62.1's section 2.1 "This standard applies to all indoor
or enclosed spaces that people may occupy, except where other applicable
standards and requirements dictate larger amounts of ventilation than this
standard..."
I believe the ventilation rates are to be kept the same in 90.1 for
breathing, building wash-out, and of course energy. I would think safety
would take precedence over these factors when your trying to compare apples
to apples.

What do you others think?

      2010 ACEEE SUMMER STUDY ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY
      IN BUILDINGS
      *"The Climate for Efficiency is Now "*

*August 15--20, 2010
Asilomar Conference Grounds <http://www.visitasilomar.com/>
Pacific Grove, California *

    *Conference Co-Chairs:*

        *Robert Hawsey, National Renewable Energy Laboratory *
        *Craig Wray, Lawrence Berkeley National Labratory

        *

The 2010 ACEEE Summer Study is the 15th biennial ACEEE conference on 
Energy Efficiency in Buildings. A diverse group of professionals from 
around the world will gather at this preeminent meeting to discuss the 
technological basis for, and practical implementation of, reducing 
energy use and climate impacts associated with buildings. Presentations 
and discussions will relate to the theme, "The Climate for Efficiency is 
Now." Global activities related to energy efficiency in buildings are 
rapidly expanding, in part to stimulate world economies, but also to 
avoid the worst consequences of climate change and resource depletion. 
To achieve its full potential, however, this energy efficiency "engine" 
needs to address sustainable development and climate issues that go 
beyond buildings. Well integrated programs, technologies, and financing 
sources need to be developed. A new generation of multi-disciplinary 
practitioners, researchers, and policymakers needs to be trained and 
quickly deployed to solve the closely-coupled energy efficiency and 
climate problems that we face. Come to the 2010 Summer Study, where you 
can share your ideas and engage in dialogue with leading thinkers, 
visionaries, and luminaries in the field, while experiencing the 
magnificent natural setting of Asilomar.

We invite you to contribute your most creative work in the following areas:

    * energy technologies and information technologies and practices
    * market transformation
    * design and performance of buildings
    * program design, implementation, and evaluation
    * human and social dimensions of energy use
    * utility regulation, strategies, and policy
    * sustainable communities
    * integrating energy efficiency and climate change policies
    * workforce training

More information, including submitting your abstracts online, is 
available at the conference web site -

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How does Fancoil simulation works in DOE2?
Message-ID: <002801ca4bf2$6c122de0$443689a0$@cubillas@uca.es>

Hello. I?m interesting in the Fancoil simulation subroutine in DOE2. I have
found that the specific subroutine in this case is F-coil. But I haven?t
seen clearly which performance curves use and how it do. If you read the
DOE2 manuals, here you can read that Cool capacity is the product of the
Capacity at ARI rated conditions multiplied by the temperatures function.
This function appears in the manuals like a function of entering air
temperatures (dry and wet), but not appear any relation between the cool
capacity and the entering water temperature. If I run eQuest I can see that
the performance curves associated to Fancoil cool coil include the
CHW-Coil-Cap-fEWB&EWT (a function of the entering water temperature), but
however, I can?t find in DOE2 manuals how this function is used. And,..what
about the influence of air and water flows functions in the cool capacity?
how are these used?

I hope someone can resolve my doubts. Thank you very much in advance.

This was my hypothesis, but none of my DesignBuilder students bought that.
Indeed, the glass surfaces temperatures (internal and external) were higher
than the outside temperature. On the other hand, the internal temperature
was lower than outside temperature. Apparently the glass tends to lose heat
from its external surface to the outside air (probably maximized by
convection) and to gain some heat due to conduction (from outside air to
internal air). In this case, my glass is losing more heat.

I appreciate your reply,
Best regards,

Raoni.

Hi All,

Just wondering what others have done in the past regarding buildings with
baseline system type 5.  Is this system type intended to have one system per
building, one per floor?

Thanks,

Hello,

 

I am working on a project which contains several spaces with large
stained glass windows. For the U-value I am using information from
ASHRAE however I have been unable to find any information on the SC or
SHGC. If anyone would be able to provide documentation or know of where
I can find information on the properties of stained glass windows I
would appreciate it.

Sam,

Regarding point 2, I think the fundamental question is: what are the
code ventilation requirements for your facility? The proposed building
may require less total supply air due to efficiency improvements such as
less glazing, but there shouldn't be a difference in the amount of
outdoor air you have to provide.  In fact, in hospital and lab
facilities, the total supply air is often also mandated.  In Canada for
example, patient rooms must provide 2 ACH OA and 6 ACH total supply air.


That's why I think it's important to understand the code requirements.
If there is a code that governs how much outdoor air and total air must
be provided, then the same rates must be used in both proposed and
baseline buildings. Most, if not all, efficiency improvements will
reduce the amount of energy required to condition and move that air, but
the actually amount of outdoor air (and sometimes total air) should be
the same in both buildings, provided that you're not exceeding the
minimum ventilation requirements.  

If a 100% OA system is a designer's/client's choice, but the same
building could be built to the governing code with say 33% OA, the
baseline building will use the minimum code rates, but the proposed
design should get penalized for over-ventilating. What I've found on
previous projects is that the code ventilation rates typically govern
the sizing of air-handling systems, meaning that the heating and cooling
loads can usually be met by the total ACH required by code for infection
control or required as make-up air when the fume hoods are operating. 

I don't know if this has any bearing on ventilation rates and so it may
not help your situation, but I recall seeing a CIR requesting that the
Labs21 modelling requirements be used in lieu of Appendix G since the
latter penalizes lab systems. I think the response from the USGBC was
that the 2007 version of 90.1 addressed particular issues that made it
difficult for labs to get significant savings and therefore Labs21
should not be used.

I hope I haven't muddied the issue further with my comments.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Heat Recovery Chillers and Lab Outdoor Air

Thanks in advance for any help.

1. I am trying to model a York heat recovery chiller for a lab facility
and one of the options on the table is adding a second injection rig to
boost the heat recovery capacity of the chiller. When I set the controls
and temperatures for a single rig, it operates closely to what my hand
calcs show for three months of operation in heat recovery mode. However,
I don't know how to boost the heating capacity in heating mode to
simulate the second rig. The heating capacity seems to be limited by the
cooling capacity. Do I need to do hand calcs and provide an exceptional
calculation which accounts for the derated chiller performance and
recovered heat? Any thoughts?

2. For the same lab, the baseline and proposed systems are 100% OA VAV
reheat. After all efficiency measures are included, the total system CFM
for the proposed model is 50,000 CFM less than the proposed, and because
it is a 100% OA system, the baseline system is providing an additional
50,000 CFM of outdoor air. Per ASHRAE G.3.1.2.5, the minimum ventilation
rates shall be the same, but changing the baseline model fundamentally
changes the way a 100% OA lab system is designed to work. If 100% OA is
not provided, then some amount of recirculation is assumed, and for labs
handling sensitive testing and materials, recirculation is not allowed
under any circumstance. Is there a CIR or addenda regarding this issue
in lab modeling? Any thoughts or experience are greatly appreciated.

SHGC is calculated as Tsol + inward flowing fraction, which takes into 
account inside temperature and absorbed heat in the glass, so convective 
and FIR radiative gain from solar radiation is incorporated into the 
SHGC.   U-factor that contributes to heat transfer without solar 
radiation is always positive and so delta T where indoor temperature is 
lower than outdoor temperature would result in a net heat gain to the 
space, not the heat loss that you are seeing.  However, note several 
other factors.  Temperature changes over the 24 hours each day, radiant 
temperature of the sky is normally much lower than the air temperature, 
so when you have very small average indoor to outdoor delta T, these 
things can switch direction of heat flow.  I guess, you would need to 
look at each hour and look at the specifics.

I have found a lack of information and expertise in modeling the thermal
mass energy-saving benefits of exposed interior finished concrete floors
relative to daylighting and HVAC operation.  

 

In this economy, owners are stripping out vinyl tile and carpet and
refinishing the concrete with our Consolideck system to get the low
maintenance, life-cycle cost reduction, and the resulting sustainability
(Wal-Mart is a leader in this) - or, they are specifying exposed
concrete floors in new construction (such as the new Harvard library
administration LEED building).  

 

I commissioned a LEED ASHRAE 90.1 computer modeling firm to demonstrate
what every architect and engineer seems to know and every text I've read
seems to say (that such floors save energy in summer and winter), but
they could not make the modeling software show that.  I have since
learned that other modeling software systems do a better job handling
this.

 

Given the sustainable aspects of exposed concrete floors, I think
research into the energy benefits relating to daylighting of exposed
concrete floors would make an important contribution to Green building.

 

We found that modeling the light reflectivity of such floors and its
impact on lighting and HVAC use was less problematic than thermal mass
modeling -- but far from a trivial exercise.  This too could be a worthy
area of research - probably best combined with the thermal mass study.

Luka/Sam,

I agree with Luka's response most of the time.  However, in laboratory facilities, the air change rates aren't typically dictated by code or ASHRAE, and usually the Client/standards/best practice drive them to be 100% OA.  With regards to modeling and Appendix G, one way to interpret modeling approach is to see the Baseline system (i.e. System 7) as also being a 100% OA system.  Thus, any ventilation or load driven spaces needing more than minimum ventilation are still being supplied with 100% OA.  With Appendix G, one reading of the ventilation requirement is that the Baseline AHU should only be modeled with the minimum required OA cfm, with the remaining supply air needed to be from return air.  This is what one recent reviewer stipulated.  The issue with this that many modelers that understand labs will struggle with the fact that such a system would NOT be installed in a project because return air lab systems are practically non-existent.  What we did see lately on a GBCI project review was the requirement to limit the Baseline OA to the minimum required no more than the Proposed OA, forcing us to have a return air lab AHU for the Baseline building.  ASHRAE 90.1 and USGBC interpretations have often not been concerned with what is typical or "real" in the case of the Baseline building, it's really about energy.   So, if other reviewers consistently rule this way, as we recently experienced, the message is that the energy target of 90.1 holds steady even for labs and outweighs the safety concerns of real design when considering the Baseline building.  Thus, Proposed designs looking at chilled beams, fan coils, or other zone level systems used to decouple ventilation will be compared against a return air lab system.  This will clearly reduce the potential to show savings between the two models.

Sam,

Regarding point 2, I think the fundamental question is: what are the
code ventilation requirements for your facility? The proposed building
may require less total supply air due to efficiency improvements such as
less glazing, but there shouldn't be a difference in the amount of
outdoor air you have to provide.  In fact, in hospital and lab
facilities, the total supply air is often also mandated.  In Canada for
example, patient rooms must provide 2 ACH OA and 6 ACH total supply air.


That's why I think it's important to understand the code requirements.
If there is a code that governs how much outdoor air and total air must
be provided, then the same rates must be used in both proposed and
baseline buildings. Most, if not all, efficiency improvements will
reduce the amount of energy required to condition and move that air, but
the actually amount of outdoor air (and sometimes total air) should be
the same in both buildings, provided that you're not exceeding the
minimum ventilation requirements.  

If a 100% OA system is a designer's/client's choice, but the same
building could be built to the governing code with say 33% OA, the
baseline building will use the minimum code rates, but the proposed
design should get penalized for over-ventilating. What I've found on
previous projects is that the code ventilation rates typically govern
the sizing of air-handling systems, meaning that the heating and cooling
loads can usually be met by the total ACH required by code for infection
control or required as make-up air when the fume hoods are operating. 

I don't know if this has any bearing on ventilation rates and so it may
not help your situation, but I recall seeing a CIR requesting that the
Labs21 modelling requirements be used in lieu of Appendix G since the
latter penalizes lab systems. I think the response from the USGBC was
that the 2007 version of 90.1 addressed particular issues that made it
difficult for labs to get significant savings and therefore Labs21

I hope I haven't muddied the issue further with my comments.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Heat Recovery Chillers and Lab Outdoor Air

Thanks in advance for any help.

1. I am trying to model a York heat recovery chiller for a lab facility
and one of the options on the table is adding a second injection rig to
boost the heat recovery capacity of the chiller. When I set the controls
and temperatures for a single rig, it operates closely to what my hand
calcs show for three months of operation in heat recovery mode. However,
I don't know how to boost the heating capacity in heating mode to
simulate the second rig. The heating capacity seems to be limited by the
cooling capacity. Do I need to do hand calcs and provide an exceptional
calculation which accounts for the derated chiller performance and
recovered heat? Any thoughts?

2. For the same lab, the baseline and proposed systems are 100% OA VAV
reheat. After all efficiency measures are included, the total system CFM
for the proposed model is 50,000 CFM less than the proposed, and because
it is a 100% OA system, the baseline system is providing an additional
50,000 CFM of outdoor air. Per ASHRAE G.3.1.2.5, the minimum ventilation
rates shall be the same, but changing the baseline model fundamentally
changes the way a 100% OA lab system is designed to work. If 100% OA is
not provided, then some amount of recirculation is assumed, and for labs
handling sensitive testing and materials, recirculation is not allowed
under any circumstance. Is there a CIR or addenda regarding this issue
in lab modeling? Any thoughts or experience are greatly appreciated.

I have found a lack of information and expertise in modeling the thermal
mass energy-saving benefits of exposed interior finished concrete floors
relative to daylighting and HVAC operation.  

 

In this economy, owners are stripping out vinyl tile and carpet and
refinishing the concrete with our Consolideck system to get the low
maintenance, life-cycle cost reduction, and the resulting sustainability
(Wal-Mart is a leader in this) - or, they are specifying exposed concrete
floors in new construction (such as the new Harvard library administration
LEED building).  

 

I commissioned a LEED ASHRAE 90.1 computer modeling firm to demonstrate what
every architect and engineer seems to know and every text I've read seems to
say (that such floors save energy in summer and winter), but they could not
make the modeling software show that.  I have since learned that other
modeling software systems do a better job handling this.

 

Given the sustainable aspects of exposed concrete floors, I think research
into the energy benefits relating to daylighting of exposed concrete floors
would make an important contribution to Green building.

 

We found that modeling the light reflectivity of such floors and its impact
on lighting and HVAC use was less problematic than thermal mass modeling --
but far from a trivial exercise.  This too could be a worthy area of
research - probably best combined with the thermal mass study.

When you model a simple building in Energy-10 with a selected "Carpeted
Slab" as a basecase, and then change that to "Slab" only (i.e. expose
the slab or remove the carpet), and add the slab area under the
"Interior wall" tab (to simulate exposed thermal mass) and specify the
material of this exposed slab as concrete...

You can clearly see the energy savings in the output and the advantage
of thermal storage concrete floors

Paul,
The item in 90.1 you pointed out is exactly the problem we are having
(and that 90.1-2004 does not address lab buildings). We just submitted a
lab/hospital building to the GBCI and included a separate narrative
which reads very similar to your email below, pointing out real life
construction and operation for 100% OA buildings (no recirculation air)
versus ASHRAE (with recirculation air). It sounds like the response we
will get from GBCI is to follow ASHRAE exactly, but we can hope.

Thanks for your input.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Heat Recovery Chillers and Lab Outdoor Air

Luka/Sam,

I agree with Luka's response most of the time.  However, in laboratory
facilities, the air change rates aren't typically dictated by code or
ASHRAE, and usually the Client/standards/best practice drive them to be
100% OA.  With regards to modeling and Appendix G, one way to interpret
modeling approach is to see the Baseline system (i.e. System 7) as also
being a 100% OA system.  Thus, any ventilation or load driven spaces
needing more than minimum ventilation are still being supplied with 100%
OA.  With Appendix G, one reading of the ventilation requirement is that
the Baseline AHU should only be modeled with the minimum required OA
cfm, with the remaining supply air needed to be from return air.  This
is what one recent reviewer stipulated.  The issue with this that many
modelers that understand labs will struggle with the fact that such a
system would NOT be installed in a project because return air lab
systems are practically non-existent.  What we did see lately on a GBCI
project review was the requirement to limit the Baseline OA to the
minimum required no more than the Proposed OA, forcing us to have a
return air lab AHU for the Baseline building.  ASHRAE 90.1 and USGBC
interpretations have often not been concerned with what is typical or
"real" in the case of the Baseline building, it's really about energy.
So, if other reviewers consistently rule this way, as we recently
experienced, the message is that the energy target of 90.1 holds steady
even for labs and outweighs the safety concerns of real design when
considering the Baseline building.  Thus, Proposed designs looking at
chilled beams, fan coils, or other zone level systems used to decouple
ventilation will be compared against a return air lab system.  This will
clearly reduce the potential to show savings between the two models.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Heat Recovery Chillers and Lab Outdoor Air

Sam,

Regarding point 2, I think the fundamental question is: what are the
code ventilation requirements for your facility? The proposed building
may require less total supply air due to efficiency improvements such as
less glazing, but there shouldn't be a difference in the amount of
outdoor air you have to provide.  In fact, in hospital and lab
facilities, the total supply air is often also mandated.  In Canada for
example, patient rooms must provide 2 ACH OA and 6 ACH total supply air.


That's why I think it's important to understand the code requirements.
If there is a code that governs how much outdoor air and total air must
be provided, then the same rates must be used in both proposed and
baseline buildings. Most, if not all, efficiency improvements will
reduce the amount of energy required to condition and move that air, but
the actually amount of outdoor air (and sometimes total air) should be
the same in both buildings, provided that you're not exceeding the
minimum ventilation requirements.  

If a 100% OA system is a designer's/client's choice, but the same
building could be built to the governing code with say 33% OA, the
baseline building will use the minimum code rates, but the proposed
design should get penalized for over-ventilating. What I've found on
previous projects is that the code ventilation rates typically govern
the sizing of air-handling systems, meaning that the heating and cooling
loads can usually be met by the total ACH required by code for infection
control or required as make-up air when the fume hoods are operating. 

I don't know if this has any bearing on ventilation rates and so it may
not help your situation, but I recall seeing a CIR requesting that the
Labs21 modelling requirements be used in lieu of Appendix G since the
latter penalizes lab systems. I think the response from the USGBC was
that the 2007 version of 90.1 addressed particular issues that made it
difficult for labs to get significant savings and therefore Labs21
should not be used.

I hope I haven't muddied the issue further with my comments.

Message-ID: <7F3D10949562FE448CAE07E9758469062EF154@AESVR01.ambient-e.local>

I have a building that I have included an electrical peak demand ratchet
to give my peak demand during the hours of 3-6pm for June, July and
August.  This seems to work and I get a peak demand for each month as
149.3, 144.2 and 143.7 kW.  When I look at the simulation outputs and
the electrical demand charts these give me an overall peak demand of
87.6, 86.6 and 93.1 kW respectively.  How can my ratchet be giving
higher numbers than my overall peak electric demand?

 

Has anyone noticed this issue before?

Thanks

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Underfloor air - more questions
Message-ID: <55BA83825A482144A8637F9CAA981F7614F69BA5@las-mail.lordaecksargent.internal>

We have this historic building that we are renovating and are
considering underfloor air distribution. The space is a high bay space
(around 50 feet tall) that will be occupied by students with computers.
The design currently has an access floor 6" above the existing floor. We
are thinking of raising it a little more and running the supply air
through underfloor ducts (we can't do a plenum because of the condition
of the existing floor). 

 

As far as I can tell the energy benefits of the underfloor air system
are:

 

1.       Higher supply air temperature (68F)

2.        Lower static pressure 

3.       Stratification (lights, equipment and people heat stratifies
above the return air grills. 

 

The alternate is a supply duct that throws air across the space (60 feet
wide)  from a height of 20 feet. 

 

So my questions are:

 

1.       If the UFAD goes through ducts (as opposed to a plenum) is the
reduced static pressure realistic? How much would you expect to see it
reduce by?

2.       How much stratification can you expect here? I assume there is
a radiant portion from these things in addition to the convective
portion. Would a 50% reduction in the sensible loads be realistic? I
know the normal procedure would be to assign the rest of the loads to
the return plenum, but it this case the return will be ducted at 8',
while the warm air will be allowed to plume up to 50. Does that change
things?

3.       I assume I should model the upper part of the zone as a plenum.
In which case - does the upper plenum start at 20'  for the alternate
system (spiral duct at 20'), and at 8' for the UFAD?

 

All responses are appreciated

 

Thanks

>We have this historic building that we are 
>renovating and are considering underfloor air 
>distribution. The space is a high bay space 
>(around 50 feet tall) that will be occupied by 
>students with computers. The design currently 
>has an access floor 6? above the existing floor. 
>We are thinking of raising it a little more and 
>running the supply air through underfloor ducts 
>(we can?t do a plenum because of the condition of the existing floor).
>
>As far as I can tell the energy benefits of the underfloor air system are:

>1.       Higher supply air temperature (68F)
>2.        Lower static pressure
>3.       Stratification (lights, equipment and 
>people heat stratifies above the return air grills.
>
>The alternate is a supply duct that throws air 
>across the space (60 feet wide)  from a height of 20 feet.

>So my questions are:

>1.       If the UFAD goes through ducts (as

>2.       How much stratification can you expect

>portion. Would a 50% reduction in the sensible 
>loads be realistic? I know the normal procedure 
>would be to assign the rest of the loads to the 
>return plenum, but it this case the return will 
>be ducted at 8?, while the warm air will be 
>allowed to plume up to 50. Does that change  things?
>3.       I assume I should model the upper part

Hi Sam,

You can contact Vanderweil Engineers in NJ as they did the energy modeling for the Yale Uninversity's Chemistry Research Lab Building when I was the sustainable design consultant for RETEC (working with Mark Loeffler - now at Atelier Ten). 

Lee Schofer was the engineer at Vanderweil and hopefully they will give you full details on how they modeled the 100% outside air lab building per the USGBC's response to our LEED-NC v2.1 CIR. note the building received LEED-NC v2.1 Silver certification.

Just bear in mind that dry bulb temperatures and cooling design
dry-bulbs are slightly higher in Abu Dhabi compared to Dubai (you can
find design conditions for both cities from the 2005 ASHRAE Fundamentals
CD, so you might get some unmet cooling hours if you're using chillers
sized for Dubai's climate.  Cooling towers shouldn't be affected since
wet-bulbs are almost identical.

I am working on a grocery store and want to compare the energy usage
with the ASHRAE 90.1 standard.  Has anyone done this before?  I modeled
both the baseline and our design.  The baseline uses packaged VAV RTU
with a natural gas fired boiler.  Our design uses packaged RTU's with
gas fired heat exchangers.  I am getting an energy savings of 90% when
compared to the baseline.  I might have a bust in my systems when I set
it up in Trace but I don't know where.  Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <80548DB3FD17423CABD2CD88E7505D90@hawkeye>

All:
 
I've come across some poorly documented simplified methods for accounting
for latent portion of annual ventilation/infiltration loads. The fundamental
equations used in the method include a term defined as a "Humidity Factor".

 
It appears that, at one time, by someone, a 'Humidity Factor' was calculated
for each TMY2 site. From what I can gather (I have a table by TMY2 city) the
'Humidity Factor' for the TMY2 data set ranged from a maximum of 3.83 (Guam)
to a minimum of 1 (Pheonix, AZ, Fairbanks, AK and several other sites with
low humidity climates). As an intermediate point  - Louisville, KY's
Humidity Factor is 2.27. 
 
I'd like to understand how a 'Humidity Factor' is determined for a given
TMY2 dataset (again, poor documentation). My web-searches have returned
examples where others have used this factor in various energy estimating
methods - but I have found no one who has sourced the derivations. 
 
Does anyone out there recall the fundamental method(s) used to derive the
'Humidity Factor'? 
 
Deep thanks in advance for ANY assistance,

I am working on a grocery store and want to compare the
energy usage with the ASHRAE 90.1 standard.  Has anyone done this
before?  I modeled both the baseline and our design.  The baseline
uses packaged VAV RTU with a natural gas fired boiler.  Our design uses
packaged RTU?s with gas fired heat exchangers.  I am getting an
energy savings of 90% when compared to the baseline.  I might have a bust
in my systems when I set it up in Trace but I don?t know where.  Any
help is appreciated.

Hi all

 

I am attempting to estimate the cost savings which result from upgrading
an air distribution system from constant air volume to variable air
volume by the addition of VAV boxes.  We have already done a BIN
analysis for estimating the savings resulting from the addition of
outside air economizers, and I have had some difficulty in figuring out
how to modify this analysis to incorporate the VAVs.  

 

I assume that I can do this by figuring out how to adjust the supply
flow for each temperature bin, but I am not sure how to do this
appropriately.

 

Can anyone please help me on this, or direct me to a resource that I may
have overlooked while doing my research?

 

Thank you all very much

My drift is that it would be easier to integrate both technologies in ther eQuest program. There you would have the VAV rise and fall of airflow, coupled with the air economizer effects.

Hi John

 

Thanks for your reply.  Since we already have the BIN analysis, we are
trying to be consistent with what we have rather than redoing a whole
bunch of work (in the sense of building an eQuest from scratch).

 

Thanks again.

Message-ID: <A9E31731F7A9C14FA1E38F98A918D11003F6B879@peci-exch1.peci>

Hi All,

I've been looking through a model in EnergyPro that has a SHGCc of 0.99
entered into the baseline model, because the existing office baseline
building is old single-pane 1/8" glazing (window:wall ratio is about
30%). However, a more reasonable assumption here, based on the
non-residential Oregon code compliance manual would be SHGCc =0.86.  The
issue I'm having is that I can't re-run the model so I have no way of
telling how this might impact energy use.  My hunch is that this
difference in SHGC would have mimimal affect on the energy consumption.
Any thoughts?  

I've also been told that while the EnergyPro input for glazing
characteristics is SHGC, EnergyPro actually treats this input as a
Shading Coefficient in the calculations.  So, if this is the case then
an input of 0.99 shading coefficient would actually calculate to be a
SHGC of 0.86, and would be the correct input. Does anyone know if this
is true?

I'd appreciate any feedback you have.

Thanks,

Erin

Erin,

Depends on your building size, system type/size, orientation, shading, outdoor  conditions, etc....Are you looking at overall $cost or therms or kWh saved.  Is it 30 WWR out of 50k sf or 200k sf bld?
U value will impact heating and cooling and other things in lesser value, but if it's heating only/no cooling-will be more drastic difference.

You can check Epro support to see how the SHGC is calculated in the software: support at energysoft.com<mailto:support at energysoft.com>
-Just curious, Did Oregon  adopted Epro as it's own code compliant approved software? How do you get your baseline?

Dear all,

I am looking for practitioners from the building industry to participate in an international survey on the practical use of Building Information Modeling (BIM).
Results of the survey will be shared if you fill in your e-mail address under the last question.

You can access the survey at:
http://www.esurveyspro.com/Survey.aspx?id=0599c6f7-b10e-47fe-ba0e-92997fcb6c4d

First of all, I kindly ask you to take the survey and secondly, I would like to ask you to spread the survey to any other colleagues and team members who have come in contact with BIM.

The survey holds 26 questions and takes maximum 10 minutes of your time.


Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.

With gratitude,

I am performing mechanical design and energy modeling for an existing
dormitory renovation in upstate NY. There is a concrete crawlspace with
ground contact that I think could be used to preheat/precool makeup air.
I have checked the Bldg-sim archives but have not found any design
guides or recommendations for using existing crawlspaces/basements as
earth tubes. We'd be cutting through concrete structural walls to build
something so I need to do some homework to justify it. Any suggestions
would be appreciated.

Vikram,

Also, do not forget that since you are now able to supply the air at a
higher temperature you can set your outside economizer at a higher
temperature as well. Alot of the savings from displacement type air
distribution systems come from the increased outside air economizer use.
Good luck.

Message-ID: <3cbed0ed0910260226i6a327f7v6435719388525271@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

the University College of Limburg, Belgium (KHLIM) is seeking partners to
set up a EU Leonardo project for development of up to date course material
on CHP.
The college itself has a well-equipped lab with different types of CHP's and
storage facilities. The college has experience in writing Leonardo proposals
(and having them approved ;-)).

The minimum number of European countries that should be involved is 6.

Anyone that might be interested can either reply on this message or mail
Marc Schreurs: marc.schreurs at khlim.be

Kind regards,

Leen Peeters, PhD

I am trying to model the addition of a wrap-around heat pipe to an
air-handler with hydronic cooling and reheat. Has anyone been able to
successfully model this in eQuest? I know it can be done in a
spreadsheet environment, but that becomes complicated.
 
It would look something like this:

Message-ID: <99A2815FF4D295488E034407278B16A4037223F9@sacexm01.nexant.corp>

Ashrae 90.1 (2004) Appendix G3.1.2.2 requires a baseline building to
have less than 300 unmet hours.  What exactly does this mean?

 

To illustrate my question:  assume you have a building with 301 zones,
and each zone has 1 unmet hour per year.  This gives you a total of 301
unmet hours, and requires you to increase your baseline equipment
capacity.  But you could argue that, on average, the building has only 1
unmet hour per year.

 

Have any of you run into this?  Is it addressed in an addendum
somewhere, etc?

 

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks,

Jim,

 

That's actually a really good question that I was afraid to ask when I
first encountered it - kudos to you!  I've currently resolved to follow
what others seemed to be doing within and outside of my office:  Sum up
all unmet hours for cooling and heating between the zones just as you
describe.   In your example, I'd agree that the unmet hours of your 301
zone building total 301.

 

I do agree that this doesn't seem intuitively to be the intent of the
standard, however between what is suggested within 90.1, the LEED
handbook, and the LEED credit templates - I honestly can't see any clear
indication either way on which is the appropriate interpretation.  

 

I think the appropriate metric for ensuring appropriately sized systems
should be something like: "hours of the modeled year in which at least
one zone has an unmet cooling/heating load,"  but I think that was
avoided by all concerned parties because it's too wordy!

 

My acting interpretation, again referencing your example, is that all
systems of your 301 zone example affecting the zones with unmet
cooling/heating hours should have their heating/cooling/overall sizing
capacity ratios increased incrementally until the design hours fall
below 300 (and/or within 50 of the sum from the other model, depending
on your situation).

 

Afraid I'm only really adding to the discussion here without providing a
solid answer.  Would like to echo the desire to see anyone's experiences
that would help us know the "right" way to interpret this (in my case,
specifically in the context of a LEED submittal).

Nick,

 

Your interpretation is the correct one. According to the definitions in
Standard 90.1.

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the
thermostat setpoint range.

I agree that Nick's interpretation is correct, but this is my biggest
frustration with 90.1. For multi-zone buildings, the limit should be on the
sum of "non-concident" unmet load hours for each zone. For standard energy
modeling output reports, you can determine the total annual unmet hours for
each zone, but you don't know which hours of the year they occur.

In Jim's example, what if each of the 300 zones had 1 unmet load hour that
all occurred during the same hour of the year? Or better yet, what if you
had 300 zones with 30 hours of unmet loads (all at the same hours)? By the
90.1 reasoning, you would have 9000 unmet load hours (greater than the
number of hours in a year!).

I have thought about requesting a change to 90.1, but if the standard were
to require people to determine the sum of non-coincident unmet load hours
for each zone, it would put a large burden on the energy modeler to develop
hourly output reports for each zone and hand calculate this. It seems like
we're stuck with what we have until the energy modeling programs can produce
an output report that describes the sum of non-coincident unmet load hours.

Mike,

 

I appreciate you bringing this up.  This definition drives straight to
the heart of defining the issue-at-hand...  Since I kinda presented both
sides of the issue at once - I'd like to clarify where I stand regarding
what the correct interpretation should be.  

 

The logic is as follows:  If a modeled year has 8,760 hours, can there
be 10,000 unmet load hours?  By strict reading of the standard's
definition below, I would put my foot down stating there can only be
8,760, at most.  

 

By common practice however, it appears a majority (myself included) sum
unmet cooling/heating hours between the zones, even if they should fall
on the same modeled hour, against the intent of the standard.  

 

My pure speculation (for what it's worth, as a young EIT) is this
practice developed because eQuest BDL reports don't present the crunched
numbers in a way that makes the sum of unmet load hours, as intended by
90.1, easy to determine.  I wouldn't be shocked to learn other energy
modeling software packages generate LEED compliance summaries featuring
unmet load hour totals in sync with the real intent of ASHRAE 90.1.

 

If there's anything I've learned from going out on a limb, it's that I'm
sure to learn something whether I fall or not!

Jim,

 

That's actually a really good question that I was afraid to ask when I
first encountered it - kudos to you!  I've currently resolved to follow
what others seemed to be doing within and outside of my office:  Sum up
all unmet hours for cooling and heating between the zones just as you
describe.   In your example, I'd agree that the unmet hours of your 301
zone building total 301.

 

I do agree that this doesn't seem intuitively to be the intent of the
standard, however between what is suggested within 90.1, the LEED
handbook, and the LEED credit templates - I honestly can't see any clear
indication either way on which is the appropriate interpretation.  

 

I think the appropriate metric for ensuring appropriately sized systems
should be something like: "hours of the modeled year in which at least
one zone has an unmet cooling/heating load,"  but I think that was
avoided by all concerned parties because it's too wordy!

 

My acting interpretation, again referencing your example, is that all
systems of your 301 zone example affecting the zones with unmet
cooling/heating hours should have their heating/cooling/overall sizing
capacity ratios increased incrementally until the design hours fall
below 300 (and/or within 50 of the sum from the other model, depending
on your situation).

 

Afraid I'm only really adding to the discussion here without providing a
solid answer.  Would like to echo the desire to see anyone's experiences
that would help us know the "right" way to interpret this (in my case,
specifically in the context of a LEED submittal).

Ashrae 90.1 (2004) Appendix G3.1.2.2 requires a baseline building to
have less than 300 unmet hours.  What exactly does this mean?

 

To illustrate my question:  assume you have a building with 301 zones,
and each zone has 1 unmet hour per year.  This gives you a total of 301
unmet hours, and requires you to increase your baseline equipment
capacity.  But you could argue that, on average, the building has only 1
unmet hour per year.

 

Have any of you run into this?  Is it addressed in an addendum
somewhere, etc?

 

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks,

I think eQuest and any DOE2 based software does report the hours of
loads not being met as required by Appendix G. In the BEPS report it
gives "PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE". My
understanding of this number is that it is a percentage of scheduled fan
run-time hours, so some calculation may be necessary.

Dear All,

 

Explanation of Unmet Hours is as follows:

 

Unmet Hours:

Unmet hours of a building are the summation of the number of hours when the
heating or the cooling set point temperature of a zone is not met either by
the HVAC system or by the plant.

Understanding/Interpreting/Calculating the number of unmet hours:

*	Unmet hour is for a particular zone when the zone indoor temperature
is higher than the heating or cooling set point specified in that hour.
*	The number or the percentage of unmet hours in a building is usually
given as one of the outputs of the simulation.
*	Zone wise unmet can also be read from the various output files
provided by the software used for simulation.

(Example:  

Visual DOE: "SS-J System Peak Heating and Cooling Days" report &

Energy Plus: Output Variable, "Time Cooling Set point Not met")

*	When two zones are unmet at the same hour, this will count to one
unmet hour for the building.
*	When two zones have unmet hours during different non overlapping
times of a day, the total number of unmet hours in that day is the summation
of these unmet hours of each zone. This total for the year should be
considered as the total unmet hours of the building.

Example: 

When each zone is unmet in the specified hours as beside,

 

Zone 1 unmet during:                        6          8          14
16

Zone 2 unmet during:                        6          8          12
16

Zone 3 unmet during:                        7          8          12
13

            

Total number of unmet hours of the building: 7 hrs and not 12hrs.

6          7          8          12        13        14        16

 

*	When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the percentage
of total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the simulation is
performed (not just the occupied hours)
*	As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the unmet hours of the total building
should be less than or equal to 300 hours and the difference in the base
case and proposed case should be less than or equal to 50 hours.
*	If unmet load hours in the proposed building exceed the unmet load
hours in the baseline building by more than 50, then the size of equipment
in the baseline building shall be reduced incrementally, until the condition
is satisfied.

Afraid I'm only really adding to the discussion here without providing a
solid answer.  Would like to echo the desire to see anyone's experiences
that would help us know the "right" way to interpret this (in my case,
specifically in the context of a LEED submittal).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Ashrae 90.1 (2004) Appendix G3.1.2.2 requires a baseline building to have
less than 300 unmet hours.  What exactly does this mean?

 

To illustrate my question:  assume you have a building with 301 zones, and
each zone has 1 unmet hour per year.  This gives you a total of 301 unmet
hours, and requires you to increase your baseline equipment capacity.  But
you could argue that, on average, the building has only 1 unmet hour per
year.

 

Have any of you run into this?  Is it addressed in an addendum somewhere,
etc?

 

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks,

Am I missing something or does this table and the corresponding answer
(7 unmet hours) not make sense.

 

Zone 1 unmet during:                        6          8          14
16

Zone 2 unmet during:                        6          8          12
16

Zone 3 unmet during:                        7          8          12
13

 

If the columns (hours outside of throttling range) all represent
simultaneous hours in the model then wouldn't the total number of hours
be the sum of the maximum number of hours for each time period?
(7+8+14+16=45 hours outside of range) I have looked at the chart
multiple ways and do not see how seven (7) could ever be the correct
value.

 

Yes, projects with hundreds of zones may be penalized however ASHRAE
allows similar spaces(orientation, load , HVAC system) to be combined
into a single zone which can reduce the impact of this issue.

 

I personally sum all of the hours ANY zone is outside of range without
regard to when the time period is. I feel that this is the most accurate
method of correctly sizing the HVAC systems.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Dear All,

 

Explanation of Unmet Hours is as follows:

 

Unmet Hours:

Unmet hours of a building are the summation of the number of hours when
the heating or the cooling set point temperature of a zone is not met
either by the HVAC system or by the plant.

Understanding/Interpreting/Calculating the number of unmet hours:

*	Unmet hour is for a particular zone when the zone indoor
temperature is higher than the heating or cooling set point specified in
that hour.
*	The number or the percentage of unmet hours in a building is
usually given as one of the outputs of the simulation.
*	Zone wise unmet can also be read from the various output files
provided by the software used for simulation.

(Example:  

Visual DOE: "SS-J System Peak Heating and Cooling Days" report &

Energy Plus: Output Variable, "Time Cooling Set point Not met")

*	When two zones are unmet at the same hour, this will count to
one unmet hour for the building.
*	When two zones have unmet hours during different non overlapping
times of a day, the total number of unmet hours in that day is the
summation of these unmet hours of each zone. This total for the year
should be considered as the total unmet hours of the building.

Example: 

When each zone is unmet in the specified hours as beside,

 

Zone 1 unmet during:                        6          8          14
16

Zone 2 unmet during:                        6          8          12
16

Zone 3 unmet during:                        7          8          12
13

            

Total number of unmet hours of the building: 7 hrs and not 12hrs.

6          7          8          12        13        14        16

 

*	When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the
percentage of total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the
simulation is performed (not just the occupied hours)
*	As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the unmet hours of the total building
should be less than or equal to 300 hours and the difference in the base
case and proposed case should be less than or equal to 50 hours.
*	If unmet load hours in the proposed building exceed the unmet
load hours in the baseline building by more than 50, then the size of
equipment in the baseline building shall be reduced incrementally, until
the condition is satisfied.

I think eQuest and any DOE2 based software does report the hours of
loads not being met as required by Appendix G. In the BEPS report it
gives "PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE". My
understanding of this number is that it is a percentage of scheduled fan
run-time hours, so some calculation may be necessary.

Mike,

 

I appreciate you bringing this up.  This definition drives straight to
the heart of defining the issue-at-hand...  Since I kinda presented both
sides of the issue at once - I'd like to clarify where I stand regarding
what the correct interpretation should be.  

 

The logic is as follows:  If a modeled year has 8,760 hours, can there
be 10,000 unmet load hours?  By strict reading of the standard's
definition below, I would put my foot down stating there can only be
8,760, at most.  

 

By common practice however, it appears a majority (myself included) sum
unmet cooling/heating hours between the zones, even if they should fall
on the same modeled hour, against the intent of the standard.  

 

My pure speculation (for what it's worth, as a young EIT) is this
practice developed because eQuest BDL reports don't present the crunched
numbers in a way that makes the sum of unmet load hours, as intended by
90.1, easy to determine.  I wouldn't be shocked to learn other energy
modeling software packages generate LEED compliance summaries featuring
unmet load hour totals in sync with the real intent of ASHRAE 90.1.

 

If there's anything I've learned from going out on a limb, it's that I'm
sure to learn something whether I fall or not!

Nick,

 

Your interpretation is the correct one. According to the definitions in
Standard 90.1.

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the
thermostat setpoint range.

Jim,

 

That's actually a really good question that I was afraid to ask when I
first encountered it - kudos to you!  I've currently resolved to follow
what others seemed to be doing within and outside of my office:  Sum up
all unmet hours for cooling and heating between the zones just as you
describe.   In your example, I'd agree that the unmet hours of your 301
zone building total 301.

 

I do agree that this doesn't seem intuitively to be the intent of the
standard, however between what is suggested within 90.1, the LEED
handbook, and the LEED credit templates - I honestly can't see any clear
indication either way on which is the appropriate interpretation.  

 

I think the appropriate metric for ensuring appropriately sized systems
should be something like: "hours of the modeled year in which at least
one zone has an unmet cooling/heating load,"  but I think that was
avoided by all concerned parties because it's too wordy!

 

My acting interpretation, again referencing your example, is that all
systems of your 301 zone example affecting the zones with unmet
cooling/heating hours should have their heating/cooling/overall sizing
capacity ratios increased incrementally until the design hours fall
below 300 (and/or within 50 of the sum from the other model, depending
on your situation).

 

Afraid I'm only really adding to the discussion here without providing a
solid answer.  Would like to echo the desire to see anyone's experiences
that would help us know the "right" way to interpret this (in my case,
specifically in the context of a LEED submittal).

To get 7 unmet hours you need to interpret the numbers listed as hours of the day when the load was unmet. There are 7 unique hours when the load was not met. There are differing opinions on how unmet load hours should be calculated but this seems like the most logical but possibly not the most practical depending on the simulation software used.

The logic is as follows:  If a modeled year has 8,760 hours, can there be 10,000 unmet load hours?  By strict reading of the standard's definition below, I would put my foot down stating there can only be 8,760, at most.  

 

By common practice however, it appears a majority (myself included) sum unmet cooling/heating hours between the zones, even if they should fall on the same modeled hour, against the intent of the standard.  

 

My pure speculation (for what it's worth, as a young EIT) is this practice developed because eQuest BDL reports don't present the crunched numbers in a way that makes the sum of unmet load hours, as intended by 90.1, easy to determine.  I wouldn't be shocked to learn other energy modeling software packages generate LEED compliance summaries featuring unmet load hour totals in sync with the real intent of ASHRAE 90.1.

 

If there's anything I've learned from going out on a limb, it's that I'm sure to learn something whether I fall or not!

 

~Nick

Nick,

 

Your interpretation is the correct one. According to the definitions in Standard 90.1.

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the thermostat setpoint range.

Jim,

 

That's actually a really good question that I was afraid to ask when I first encountered it - kudos to you!  I've currently resolved to follow what others seemed to be doing within and outside of my office:  Sum up all unmet hours for cooling and heating between the zones just as you describe.   In your example, I'd agree that the unmet hours of your 301 zone building total 301.

 

I do agree that this doesn't seem intuitively to be the intent of the standard, however between what is suggested within 90.1, the LEED handbook, and the LEED credit templates - I honestly can't see any clear indication either way on which is the appropriate interpretation.  

 

I think the appropriate metric for ensuring appropriately sized systems should be something like: "hours of the modeled year in which at least one zone has an unmet cooling/heating load,"  but I think that was avoided by all concerned parties because it's too wordy!

 

My acting interpretation, again referencing your example, is that all systems of your 301 zone example affecting the zones with unmet cooling/heating hours should have their heating/cooling/overall sizing capacity ratios increased incrementally until the design hours fall below 300 (and/or within 50 of the sum from the other model, depending on your situation).

 

Afraid I'm only really adding to the discussion here without providing a solid answer.  Would like to echo the desire to see anyone's experiences that would help us know the "right" way to interpret this (in my case, specifically in the context of a LEED submittal).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Ashrae 90.1 (2004) Appendix G3.1.2.2 requires a baseline building to have less than 300 unmet hours.  What exactly does this mean?

 

To illustrate my question:  assume you have a building with 301 zones, and each zone has 1 unmet hour per year.  This gives you a total of 301 unmet hours, and requires you to increase your baseline equipment capacity.  But you could argue that, on average, the building has only 1 unmet hour per year.

 

Have any of you run into this?  Is it addressed in an addendum somewhere, etc?

 

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks,

The unmet hour table meant to show the hours of the day in which that
particular zone is unmet and not the number of hours.

The same information is shown in the below table for one particular day-
suppose Jan 1st

 In the table below:

?        Yes ? represents that the hour is unmet by the system

?        No ? represents that the temperatures are met in the zone

  *Hour of the day*

*Zone 2*

*Zone 3*

As seen in the table:

Total unmet hours in the building is not the sum of number of unmet hours in
each zone (which is 12hrs) but is the sum of number of unmet hours of the
building (which is 7hrs).


I am also attaching the table as an image.In case the formatting goes wrong

Thanks to all for the insight and information!  This makes much more
sense.  Is there a report in eQUEST that calculates unmet hours in this
way, or do I need to do some custom analysis?

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Dear All,

 

Explanation of Unmet Hours is as follows:

 

Unmet Hours:

Unmet hours of a building are the summation of the number of hours when
the heating or the cooling set point temperature of a zone is not met
either by the HVAC system or by the plant.

Understanding/Interpreting/Calculating the number of unmet hours:

*	Unmet hour is for a particular zone when the zone indoor
temperature is higher than the heating or cooling set point specified in
that hour.
*	The number or the percentage of unmet hours in a building is
usually given as one of the outputs of the simulation.
*	Zone wise unmet can also be read from the various output files
provided by the software used for simulation.

(Example:  

Visual DOE: "SS-J System Peak Heating and Cooling Days" report &

Energy Plus: Output Variable, "Time Cooling Set point Not met")

*	When two zones are unmet at the same hour, this will count to
one unmet hour for the building.
*	When two zones have unmet hours during different non overlapping
times of a day, the total number of unmet hours in that day is the
summation of these unmet hours of each zone. This total for the year
should be considered as the total unmet hours of the building.

Example: 

When each zone is unmet in the specified hours as beside,

 

Zone 1 unmet during:                        6          8          14
16

Zone 2 unmet during:                        6          8          12
16

Zone 3 unmet during:                        7          8          12
13

            

Total number of unmet hours of the building: 7 hrs and not 12hrs.

6          7          8          12        13        14        16

 

*	When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the
percentage of total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the
simulation is performed (not just the occupied hours)
*	As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the unmet hours of the total building
should be less than or equal to 300 hours and the difference in the base
case and proposed case should be less than or equal to 50 hours.
*	If unmet load hours in the proposed building exceed the unmet
load hours in the baseline building by more than 50, then the size of
equipment in the baseline building shall be reduced incrementally, until
the condition is satisfied.

I think eQuest and any DOE2 based software does report the hours of

gives "PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE". My
understanding of this number is that it is a percentage of scheduled fan

Mike,

 

I appreciate you bringing this up.  This definition drives straight to
the heart of defining the issue-at-hand...  Since I kinda presented both
sides of the issue at once - I'd like to clarify where I stand regarding
what the correct interpretation should be.  

 

The logic is as follows:  If a modeled year has 8,760 hours, can there
be 10,000 unmet load hours?  By strict reading of the standard's
definition below, I would put my foot down stating there can only be
8,760, at most.  

 

By common practice however, it appears a majority (myself included) sum
unmet cooling/heating hours between the zones, even if they should fall
on the same modeled hour, against the intent of the standard.  

 

My pure speculation (for what it's worth, as a young EIT) is this
practice developed because eQuest BDL reports don't present the crunched
numbers in a way that makes the sum of unmet load hours, as intended by
90.1, easy to determine.  I wouldn't be shocked to learn other energy
modeling software packages generate LEED compliance summaries featuring
unmet load hour totals in sync with the real intent of ASHRAE 90.1.

 

If there's anything I've learned from going out on a limb, it's that I'm
sure to learn something whether I fall or not!

Jim,

 

That's actually a really good question that I was afraid to ask when I
first encountered it - kudos to you!  I've currently resolved to follow
what others seemed to be doing within and outside of my office:  Sum up
all unmet hours for cooling and heating between the zones just as you
describe.   In your example, I'd agree that the unmet hours of your 301
zone building total 301.

 

I do agree that this doesn't seem intuitively to be the intent of the
standard, however between what is suggested within 90.1, the LEED
handbook, and the LEED credit templates - I honestly can't see any clear
indication either way on which is the appropriate interpretation.  

 

I think the appropriate metric for ensuring appropriately sized systems
should be something like: "hours of the modeled year in which at least
one zone has an unmet cooling/heating load,"  but I think that was
avoided by all concerned parties because it's too wordy!

 

My acting interpretation, again referencing your example, is that all
systems of your 301 zone example affecting the zones with unmet
cooling/heating hours should have their heating/cooling/overall sizing
capacity ratios increased incrementally until the design hours fall
below 300 (and/or within 50 of the sum from the other model, depending
on your situation).

 

Afraid I'm only really adding to the discussion here without providing a
solid answer.  Would like to echo the desire to see anyone's experiences
that would help us know the "right" way to interpret this (in my case,
specifically in the context of a LEED submittal).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Ashrae 90.1 (2004) Appendix G3.1.2.2 requires a baseline building to
have less than 300 unmet hours.  What exactly does this mean?

 

To illustrate my question:  assume you have a building with 301 zones,
and each zone has 1 unmet hour per year.  This gives you a total of 301
unmet hours, and requires you to increase your baseline equipment
capacity.  But you could argue that, on average, the building has only 1
unmet hour per year.

 

Have any of you run into this?  Is it addressed in an addendum
somewhere, etc?

 

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks,

Some of DOE recommendations is using R-50 in the attic ( above the ceiling). If the HVAC ducts are also in the attic, is it true that this might result in condensation on the ducts espicially in moderate to hot climates? is there any literature on this or any practical experience.
Any help is really appreciated.

I agree that Nick's interpretation is correct, but this is my biggest frustration with 90.1. For multi-zone buildings, the limit should be on the sum of "non-concident" unmet load hours for each zone. For standard energy modeling output reports, you can determine the total annual unmet hours for each zone, but you don't know which hours of the year they occur. 

In Jim's example, what if each of the 300 zones had 1 unmet load hour that all occurred during the same hour of the year? Or better yet, what if you had 300 zones with 30 hours of unmet loads (all at the same hours)? By the 90.1 reasoning, you would have 9000 unmet load hours (greater than the number of hours in a year!). 

I have thought about requesting a change to 90.1, but if the standard were to require people to determine the sum of non-coincident unmet load hours for each zone, it would put a large burden on the energy modeler to develop hourly output reports for each zone and hand calculate this. It seems like we're stuck with what we have until the energy modeling programs can produce an output report that describes the sum of non-coincident unmet load hours.

Ashu,

 

I am in agreement with everything you stated except possibly this;

 

"When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the percentage of
total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the simulation is
performed (not just the occupied hours)"

 

My understanding is that some simulation programs (DOE2 and eQuest in
particular) report this as a percentage of hours that the fan is
running. I could be wrong, and I am sure some of you DOE2 experts can
comment on what is reported in the DOE2 BEPS report.

 

Mike

That's actually a really good question that I was afraid to ask when I
first encountered it - kudos to you!  I've currently resolved to follow
what others seemed to be doing within and outside of my office:  Sum up
all unmet hours for cooling and heating between the zones just as you
describe.   In your example, I'd agree that the unmet hours of your 301
zone building total 301.

 

I do agree that this doesn't seem intuitively to be the intent of the
standard, however between what is suggested within 90.1, the LEED
handbook, and the LEED credit templates - I honestly can't see any clear
indication either way on which is the appropriate interpretation.  

 

I think the appropriate metric for ensuring appropriately sized systems
should be something like: "hours of the modeled year in which at least
one zone has an unmet cooling/heating load,"  but I think that was
avoided by all concerned parties because it's too wordy!

 

My acting interpretation, again referencing your example, is that all
systems of your 301 zone example affecting the zones with unmet
cooling/heating hours should have their heating/cooling/overall sizing
capacity ratios increased incrementally until the design hours fall
below 300 (and/or within 50 of the sum from the other model, depending
on your situation).

 

Afraid I'm only really adding to the discussion here without providing a
solid answer.  Would like to echo the desire to see anyone's experiences
that would help us know the "right" way to interpret this (in my case,
specifically in the context of a LEED submittal).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Ashrae 90.1 (2004) Appendix G3.1.2.2 requires a baseline building to
have less than 300 unmet hours.  What exactly does this mean?

 

To illustrate my question:  assume you have a building with 301 zones,
and each zone has 1 unmet hour per year.  This gives you a total of 301
unmet hours, and requires you to increase your baseline equipment
capacity.  But you could argue that, on average, the building has only 1
unmet hour per year.

 

Have any of you run into this?  Is it addressed in an addendum
somewhere, etc?

 

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks,

I also interpret the 90.1 PRM definition as Sureka's table illustrates.
I imagine the intent of the original writers was that you would get
about one hour/day for either morning startup or at/near design
conditions, when MANY zones might be "outside the throttling range"
during that hour. Any other interpretation penalizes buildings with more
zones. And it should not matter whether Zones 1,2 and 3 are served by
the same system or separate systems.
 
For DOE2/eQuest, as far as I know, this is essentially how the BEPS %
unmet hours are determined, though apparently the percent references
system "on" hours. I THINK this is calculated as a fraction of the
system with the greatest "on" hours, but I'm not sure how cycling "on"
is treated. I think that if a model includes any system, even a tiny
virtual independent system, with continuous operation, then the overall
% from BEPS can be multiplied by 8760 (hopefully NOT 8760 + design day
hours)!
 
Unless it has been added to the newest versions of eQuest, there are NO
DOE2/eQuest summary outputs which decompose "unmet hours" into heating
and cooling for the BUILDING, as requested by the PRM and EAc1 forms.
However this decomposition is not specifically required by the language
of the standard. AND these #s might not necessarily be additive, a good
reason NOT to try to decompose and then sum these. During startup on a
winter day, many interior zones might be "undercooled" while many
exterior zones are "underheated," yielding ONE unmet load hour, but also
ONE hour cooling loads not met and ONE hour heating loads not met...
which would appear to become TWO hours if entered separately then
summed.

P.S. Before increasing system or zone capacities, it's always wise to
check myriad other inputs to assure that some schedule or setting hasn't
turned off the heating or cooling or reset SA temps in some
unanticipated fashion.

As seen in the table:
Total unmet hours in the building is not the sum of number of unmet
hours in each zone (which is 12hrs) but is the sum of number of unmet
hours of the building (which is 7hrs).

Zone 1 unmet during: 6 8 14 16

If the columns (hours outside of throttling range) all represent
simultaneous hours in the model then wouldn?t the total number of hours
be the sum of the maximum number of hours for each time period?
(7+8+14+16=45 hours outside of range) I have looked at the chart
multiple ways and do not see how seven (7) could ever be the correct
value.

Yes, projects with hundreds of zones may be penalized however ASHRAE
allows similar spaces(orientation, load , HVAC system) to be combined
into a single zone which can reduce the impact of this issue.

I personally sum all of the hours ANY zone is outside of range without
regard to when the time period is. I feel that this is the most accurate
method of correctly sizing the HVAC systems.

Dear All,

Explanation of Unmet Hours is as follows:

Unmet Hours:
Unmet hours of a building are the summation of the number of hours when
the heating or the cooling set point temperature of a zone is not met
either by the HVAC system or by the plant.
Understanding/Interpreting/Calculating the number of unmet hours:Unmet
hour is for a particular zone when the zone indoor temperature is higher
than the heating or cooling set point specified in that hour. The number
or the percentage of unmet hours in a building is usually given as one
of the outputs of the simulation. Zone wise unmet can also be read from
the various output files provided by the software used for simulation. 

(Example: 
Visual DOE: ?SS-J System Peak Heating and Cooling Days? report &
Energy Plus: Output Variable, ?Time Cooling Set point Not met?)When two
zones are unmet at the same hour, this will count to one unmet hour for
the building. When two zones have unmet hours during different non
overlapping times of a day, the total number of unmet hours in that day
is the summation of these unmet hours of each zone. This total for the
year should be considered as the total unmet hours of the building. 

Example: 
When each zone is unmet in the specified hours as beside,

Zone 1 unmet during: 6 8 14 16
Zone 2 unmet during: 6 8 12 16
Zone 3 unmet during: 7 8 12 13

Total number of unmet hours of the building: 7 hrs and not 12hrs.
6 7 8 12 13 14 16
When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the percentage of
total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the simulation is
performed (not just the occupied hours) As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the
unmet hours of the total building should be less than or equal to 300
hours and the difference in the base case and proposed case should be
less than or equal to 50 hours. If unmet load hours in the proposed
building exceed the unmet load hours in the baseline building by more
than 50, then the size of equipment in the baseline building shall be
reduced incrementally, until the condition is satisfied.

I think eQuest and any DOE2 based software does report the hours of
loads not being met as required by Appendix G. In the BEPS report it
gives ?PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE?. My
understanding of this number is that it is a percentage of scheduled fan
run-time hours, so some calculation may be necessary.

Mike,

I appreciate you bringing this up. This definition drives straight to
the heart of defining the issue-at-hand? Since I kinda presented both
sides of the issue at once ? I?d like to clarify where I stand regarding
what the correct interpretation should be. 

The logic is as follows: If a modeled year has 8,760 hours, can there
be 10,000 unmet load hours? By strict reading of the standard?s
definition below, I would put my foot down stating there can only be
8,760, at most. 

By common practice however, it appears a majority (myself included) sum
unmet cooling/heating hours between the zones, even if they should fall
on the same modeled hour, against the intent of the standard. 

My pure speculation (for what it?s worth, as a young EIT) is this
practice developed because eQuest BDL reports don?t present the crunched
numbers in a way that makes the sum of unmet load hours, as intended by
90.1, easy to determine. I wouldn?t be shocked to learn other energy
modeling software packages generate LEED compliance summaries featuring
unmet load hour totals in sync with the real intent of ASHRAE 90.1.

If there?s anything I?ve learned from going out on a limb, it?s that
I?m sure to learn something whether I fall or not!

Nick,

Your interpretation is the correct one. According to the definitions in
Standard 90.1.
unmet load hour:an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the
thermostat setpoint range.

I believe that eQuest system and zone reports (SS-R and SS-F) only
report unmet hours when the fans are running.  However, the percentage
of total hours as reported by the BEPU and BEPS reports use the entire
year as the denominator (ie 8760).  I've seen a previous LEED project
accepted by stating that there are fewer than 300 unmet hours based on
the percentage reported on the BEPS report (in that case it was 3% or
263 hours).

Ashu,

 

I am in agreement with everything you stated except possibly this;

 

"When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the percentage of
total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the simulation is
performed (not just the occupied hours)"

 

My understanding is that some simulation programs (DOE2 and eQuest in
particular) report this as a percentage of hours that the fan is
running. I could be wrong, and I am sure some of you DOE2 experts can
comment on what is reported in the DOE2 BEPS report.

understanding of this number is that it is a percentage of scheduled fan
run-time hours, so some calculation may be necessary.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Mike,

 

I appreciate you bringing this up.  This definition drives straight to
the heart of defining the issue-at-hand...  Since I kinda presented both
sides of the issue at once - I'd like to clarify where I stand regarding
what the correct interpretation should be.  

 

The logic is as follows:  If a modeled year has 8,760 hours, can there
be 10,000 unmet load hours?  By strict reading of the standard's
definition below, I would put my foot down stating there can only be
8,760, at most.  

 

By common practice however, it appears a majority (myself included) sum
unmet cooling/heating hours between the zones, even if they should fall
on the same modeled hour, against the intent of the standard.  

 

My pure speculation (for what it's worth, as a young EIT) is this
practice developed because eQuest BDL reports don't present the crunched
numbers in a way that makes the sum of unmet load hours, as intended by
90.1, easy to determine.  I wouldn't be shocked to learn other energy
modeling software packages generate LEED compliance summaries featuring
unmet load hour totals in sync with the real intent of ASHRAE 90.1.

 

If there's anything I've learned from going out on a limb, it's that I'm
sure to learn something whether I fall or not!

Your interpretation is the correct one. According to the definitions in
Standard 90.1.

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the

Jim,

 

That's actually a really good question that I was afraid to ask when I
first encountered it - kudos to you!  I've currently resolved to follow
what others seemed to be doing within and outside of my office:  Sum up
all unmet hours for cooling and heating between the zones just as you
describe.   In your example, I'd agree that the unmet hours of your 301
zone building total 301.

 

I do agree that this doesn't seem intuitively to be the intent of the
standard, however between what is suggested within 90.1, the LEED
handbook, and the LEED credit templates - I honestly can't see any clear
indication either way on which is the appropriate interpretation.  

 

I think the appropriate metric for ensuring appropriately sized systems
should be something like: "hours of the modeled year in which at least
one zone has an unmet cooling/heating load,"  but I think that was
avoided by all concerned parties because it's too wordy!

 

My acting interpretation, again referencing your example, is that all
systems of your 301 zone example affecting the zones with unmet
cooling/heating hours should have their heating/cooling/overall sizing
capacity ratios increased incrementally until the design hours fall
below 300 (and/or within 50 of the sum from the other model, depending
on your situation).

 

Afraid I'm only really adding to the discussion here without providing a
solid answer.  Would like to echo the desire to see anyone's experiences
that would help us know the "right" way to interpret this (in my case,
specifically in the context of a LEED submittal).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Ashrae 90.1 (2004) Appendix G3.1.2.2 requires a baseline building to
have less than 300 unmet hours.  What exactly does this mean?

 

To illustrate my question:  assume you have a building with 301 zones,
and each zone has 1 unmet hour per year.  This gives you a total of 301
unmet hours, and requires you to increase your baseline equipment
capacity.  But you could argue that, on average, the building has only 1
unmet hour per year.

 

Have any of you run into this?  Is it addressed in an addendum
somewhere, etc?

 

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks,

EnergyPlus produces a simple summary table for this called "Time Setpoint Not Met." It has hours not met by zone and for entire facility, taking into account coincidence. Results are separated by heating and cooling as well as total time vs occupied times.

EnergyPlus uses a deviation from setpoint of 0.2C to trigger unmet time.  I hear DOE2 uses a deviation of 1.0F as a trigger.  I think this is one area where 90.1 could be clearer.

It's splitting hairs, but one item in the email from Ashu is not quite
correct.  The following sentence is from his email, and the incorrect
line is in bold:

*	As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the unmet hours of the total building
should be less than or equal to 300 hours and the difference in the base
case and proposed case should be less than or equal to 50 hours.

 

What Ashrae actually says is, ". . .unmet load hours for the proposed
design shall not exceed the number of load hours for the baseline
building design by more than 50."  

 

If you have a building where the baseline has 300 unmet hours, and the
proposed has 0 unmet hours, no correction is needed.  A correction is
only needed if the unmet hours in the proposed exceeds those in the
baseline by more than 50.  (or if either exceeds 300).  Worded
differently, if the baseline has 300 unmet hours, and the proposed
system has 0 unmet hours, you do not need to make the baseline more
stringent.

I can confirm Mike's understanding of the DOE-2/eQUEST results.  To get
the correct number of hours of unmet loads, people should MULTIPLY the
Percent hours outside throttling range from BEPS or BEPU by the total
annual "hours fans on" listed in report SS-E.

One other comment re: Ashu's write-up - I believe that (for
DOE-2/eQUEST) a zone temperature has to be more than one degree outside
the throttling range for that hour to be counted as an hour outside
throttling range.  So for a zone with a heating thermostat setpoint of
72 and a 2 degree throttling range (=> 71-73 degree "throttling range"),
the zone temperature would have to be LESS THAN 70 in order for that
hour to be counted.

related info -
We are contemplating a change to the Air-Side HVAC Summary view in the
eQUEST interface to report this total number of hours as opposed to just
the percent in the totals section at the bottom of the report.
We have also just in the past several days (thanks to the efforts of
Steve Gates) added precision to the percent hours outside throttling
range reported on BEPS & BEPU and ALSO added separate reporting of hours
any zone is either under cooled or under heated, intended for reporting
to LEED submission templates.  Assuming no further changes (which is
certainly not out of the question), future releases of DOE-2/eQUEST will
report the following in the BEPS & BEPU reports:
         PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE =
4.45
         PERCENT OF HOURS ANY PLANT LOAD NOT SATISFIED                =
0.00
         HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE                =
98
         HOURS ANY ZONE BELOW HEATING THROTTLING RANGE                =

Ashu,

 

I am in agreement with everything you stated except possibly this;

 

"When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the percentage of
total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the simulation is
performed (not just the occupied hours)"

 

My understanding is that some simulation programs (DOE2 and eQuest in
particular) report this as a percentage of hours that the fan is
running. I could be wrong, and I am sure some of you DOE2 experts can
comment on what is reported in the DOE2 BEPS report.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Dear All,

 

Explanation of Unmet Hours is as follows:

 

Unmet Hours:

Unmet hours of a building are the summation of the number of hours when
the heating or the cooling set point temperature of a zone is not met
either by the HVAC system or by the plant.

Understanding/Interpreting/Calculating the number of unmet hours:

*	Unmet hour is for a particular zone when the zone indoor
temperature is higher than the heating or cooling set point specified in
that hour.
*	The number or the percentage of unmet hours in a building is
usually given as one of the outputs of the simulation.
*	Zone wise unmet can also be read from the various output files
provided by the software used for simulation.

(Example:  

Visual DOE: "SS-J System Peak Heating and Cooling Days" report &

Energy Plus: Output Variable, "Time Cooling Set point Not met")

*	When two zones are unmet at the same hour, this will count to
one unmet hour for the building.
*	When two zones have unmet hours during different non overlapping
times of a day, the total number of unmet hours in that day is the
summation of these unmet hours of each zone. This total for the year
should be considered as the total unmet hours of the building.

Example: 

When each zone is unmet in the specified hours as beside,

 

Zone 1 unmet during:                        6          8          14
16

Zone 2 unmet during:                        6          8          12
16

Zone 3 unmet during:                        7          8          12
13

            

Total number of unmet hours of the building: 7 hrs and not 12hrs.

6          7          8          12        13        14        16

 

*	When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the
percentage of total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the
simulation is performed (not just the occupied hours)
*	As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the unmet hours of the total building
should be less than or equal to 300 hours and the difference in the base
case and proposed case should be less than or equal to 50 hours.
*	If unmet load hours in the proposed building exceed the unmet
load hours in the baseline building by more than 50, then the size of
equipment in the baseline building shall be reduced incrementally, until
the condition is satisfied.

I think eQuest and any DOE2 based software does report the hours of
loads not being met as required by Appendix G. In the BEPS report it
gives "PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE". My
understanding of this number is that it is a percentage of scheduled fan
run-time hours, so some calculation may be necessary.

Mike,

 

I appreciate you bringing this up.  This definition drives straight to
the heart of defining the issue-at-hand...  Since I kinda presented both
sides of the issue at once - I'd like to clarify where I stand regarding
what the correct interpretation should be.  

 

The logic is as follows:  If a modeled year has 8,760 hours, can there
be 10,000 unmet load hours?  By strict reading of the standard's
definition below, I would put my foot down stating there can only be
8,760, at most.  

 

By common practice however, it appears a majority (myself included) sum
unmet cooling/heating hours between the zones, even if they should fall
on the same modeled hour, against the intent of the standard.  

 

My pure speculation (for what it's worth, as a young EIT) is this

numbers in a way that makes the sum of unmet load hours, as intended by
90.1, easy to determine.  I wouldn't be shocked to learn other energy
modeling software packages generate LEED compliance summaries featuring
unmet load hour totals in sync with the real intent of ASHRAE 90.1.

 

If there's anything I've learned from going out on a limb, it's that I'm
sure to learn something whether I fall or not!

Nick,

 

Your interpretation is the correct one. According to the definitions in
Standard 90.1.

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the
thermostat setpoint range.

Jim,

 

That's actually a really good question that I was afraid to ask when I
first encountered it - kudos to you!  I've currently resolved to follow
what others seemed to be doing within and outside of my office:  Sum up
all unmet hours for cooling and heating between the zones just as you
describe.   In your example, I'd agree that the unmet hours of your 301
zone building total 301.

 

I do agree that this doesn't seem intuitively to be the intent of the
standard, however between what is suggested within 90.1, the LEED
handbook, and the LEED credit templates - I honestly can't see any clear
indication either way on which is the appropriate interpretation.  

 

I think the appropriate metric for ensuring appropriately sized systems
should be something like: "hours of the modeled year in which at least
one zone has an unmet cooling/heating load,"  but I think that was
avoided by all concerned parties because it's too wordy!

 

My acting interpretation, again referencing your example, is that all
systems of your 301 zone example affecting the zones with unmet
cooling/heating hours should have their heating/cooling/overall sizing
capacity ratios increased incrementally until the design hours fall
below 300 (and/or within 50 of the sum from the other model, depending
on your situation).

 

Afraid I'm only really adding to the discussion here without providing a
solid answer.  Would like to echo the desire to see anyone's experiences
that would help us know the "right" way to interpret this (in my case,
specifically in the context of a LEED submittal).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Ashrae 90.1 (2004) Appendix G3.1.2.2 requires a baseline building to
have less than 300 unmet hours.  What exactly does this mean?

 

To illustrate my question:  assume you have a building with 301 zones,
and each zone has 1 unmet hour per year.  This gives you a total of 301
unmet hours, and requires you to increase your baseline equipment
capacity.  But you could argue that, on average, the building has only 1
unmet hour per year.

 

Have any of you run into this?  Is it addressed in an addendum
somewhere, etc?

 

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks,

You are right. The Unmet hours of the proposed design can be less than base
case unmet hours and the difference can be more than 50 hours (or upto 300
hours as shown by you).

However, the ASHRAE 90.1 2004 user manual on page G37states:

"If the number of hours that loads are unmet by either the systems or plant
of either the baseline or the proposed model exceeds 300 hours of the 8760
hours simulated, or *differs by more than 50 hours between the two models*,
these simulation results will not be accepted as valid." I think this is
incorrect.

According to ASHRAE 90.1 2004 - "unmet load hours for the proposed
design *shall
not exceed* the number of unmet load hours for the baseline building design
by more than 50." Reverse is not required.

So, the unmet load hours for the proposed design can be less than the number
of unmet load hours for the baseline building design by more than 50.

I use to agree with the statement and methodology you have provided.
However, there have been discussions that definition of "exceed" is the
"difference of". Hence making this statement false. In addition the
ASHRAE User's Manual also indicates that it is the "difference of" and
does not use the word exceed.

It's splitting hairs, but one item in the email from Ashu is not quite
correct.  The following sentence is from his email, and the incorrect
line is in bold:

*	As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the unmet hours of the total building
should be less than or equal to 300 hours and the difference in the base
case and proposed case should be less than or equal to 50 hours.

 

What Ashrae actually says is, ". . .unmet load hours for the proposed
design shall not exceed the number of load hours for the baseline
building design by more than 50."  

 

If you have a building where the baseline has 300 unmet hours, and the
proposed has 0 unmet hours, no correction is needed.  A correction is
only needed if the unmet hours in the proposed exceeds those in the
baseline by more than 50.  (or if either exceeds 300).  Worded
differently, if the baseline has 300 unmet hours, and the proposed
system has 0 unmet hours, you do not need to make the baseline more
stringent.

I can confirm Mike's understanding of the DOE-2/eQUEST results.  To get
the correct number of hours of unmet loads, people should MULTIPLY the
Percent hours outside throttling range from BEPS or BEPU by the total
annual "hours fans on" listed in report SS-E.

One other comment re: Ashu's write-up - I believe that (for
DOE-2/eQUEST) a zone temperature has to be more than one degree outside
the throttling range for that hour to be counted as an hour outside
throttling range.  So for a zone with a heating thermostat setpoint of
72 and a 2 degree throttling range (=> 71-73 degree "throttling range"),
the zone temperature would have to be LESS THAN 70 in order for that
hour to be counted.

related info -
We are contemplating a change to the Air-Side HVAC Summary view in the
eQUEST interface to report this total number of hours as opposed to just
the percent in the totals section at the bottom of the report.
We have also just in the past several days (thanks to the efforts of
Steve Gates) added precision to the percent hours outside throttling
range reported on BEPS & BEPU and ALSO added separate reporting of hours
any zone is either under cooled or under heated, intended for reporting
to LEED submission templates.  Assuming no further changes (which is
certainly not out of the question), future releases of DOE-2/eQUEST will
report the following in the BEPS & BEPU reports:
         PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE =
4.45
         PERCENT OF HOURS ANY PLANT LOAD NOT SATISFIED                =
0.00
         HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE                =
98
         HOURS ANY ZONE BELOW HEATING THROTTLING RANGE                =

Dear All,

 

Explanation of Unmet Hours is as follows:

 

Unmet Hours:

Unmet hours of a building are the summation of the number of hours when
the heating or the cooling set point temperature of a zone is not met
either by the HVAC system or by the plant.

Understanding/Interpreting/Calculating the number of unmet hours:

*	Unmet hour is for a particular zone when the zone indoor
temperature is higher than the heating or cooling set point specified in
that hour.
*	The number or the percentage of unmet hours in a building is
usually given as one of the outputs of the simulation.
*	Zone wise unmet can also be read from the various output files
provided by the software used for simulation.

(Example:  

Visual DOE: "SS-J System Peak Heating and Cooling Days" report &

Energy Plus: Output Variable, "Time Cooling Set point Not met")

*	When two zones are unmet at the same hour, this will count to
one unmet hour for the building.
*	When two zones have unmet hours during different non overlapping
times of a day, the total number of unmet hours in that day is the
summation of these unmet hours of each zone. This total for the year
should be considered as the total unmet hours of the building.

Example: 

When each zone is unmet in the specified hours as beside,

 

Zone 1 unmet during:                        6          8          14
16

Zone 2 unmet during:                        6          8          12
16

Zone 3 unmet during:                        7          8          12
13

            

Total number of unmet hours of the building: 7 hrs and not 12hrs.

6          7          8          12        13        14        16

 

*	When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the
percentage of total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the
simulation is performed (not just the occupied hours)
*	As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the unmet hours of the total building
should be less than or equal to 300 hours and the difference in the base
case and proposed case should be less than or equal to 50 hours.
*	If unmet load hours in the proposed building exceed the unmet
load hours in the baseline building by more than 50, then the size of
equipment in the baseline building shall be reduced incrementally, until
the condition is satisfied.

I think eQuest and any DOE2 based software does report the hours of
loads not being met as required by Appendix G. In the BEPS report it
gives "PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE". My
understanding of this number is that it is a percentage of scheduled fan
run-time hours, so some calculation may be necessary.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Mike,

 

I appreciate you bringing this up.  This definition drives straight to
the heart of defining the issue-at-hand...  Since I kinda presented both
sides of the issue at once - I'd like to clarify where I stand regarding
what the correct interpretation should be.  

 

The logic is as follows:  If a modeled year has 8,760 hours, can there
be 10,000 unmet load hours?  By strict reading of the standard's
definition below, I would put my foot down stating there can only be
8,760, at most.  

 

By common practice however, it appears a majority (myself included) sum
unmet cooling/heating hours between the zones, even if they should fall
on the same modeled hour, against the intent of the standard.  

 

My pure speculation (for what it's worth, as a young EIT) is this
practice developed because eQuest BDL reports don't present the crunched
numbers in a way that makes the sum of unmet load hours, as intended by
90.1, easy to determine.  I wouldn't be shocked to learn other energy
modeling software packages generate LEED compliance summaries featuring
unmet load hour totals in sync with the real intent of ASHRAE 90.1.

 

If there's anything I've learned from going out on a limb, it's that I'm
sure to learn something whether I fall or not!

Nick,

 

Your interpretation is the correct one. According to the definitions in
Standard 90.1.

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the
thermostat setpoint range.

Jim,

 

That's actually a really good question that I was afraid to ask when I
first encountered it - kudos to you!  I've currently resolved to follow
what others seemed to be doing within and outside of my office:  Sum up
all unmet hours for cooling and heating between the zones just as you
describe.   In your example, I'd agree that the unmet hours of your 301
zone building total 301.

 

I do agree that this doesn't seem intuitively to be the intent of the
standard, however between what is suggested within 90.1, the LEED
handbook, and the LEED credit templates - I honestly can't see any clear
indication either way on which is the appropriate interpretation.  

 

I think the appropriate metric for ensuring appropriately sized systems
should be something like: "hours of the modeled year in which at least
one zone has an unmet cooling/heating load,"  but I think that was
avoided by all concerned parties because it's too wordy!

 

My acting interpretation, again referencing your example, is that all
systems of your 301 zone example affecting the zones with unmet
cooling/heating hours should have their heating/cooling/overall sizing
capacity ratios increased incrementally until the design hours fall
below 300 (and/or within 50 of the sum from the other model, depending
on your situation).

 

Afraid I'm only really adding to the discussion here without providing a
solid answer.  Would like to echo the desire to see anyone's experiences
that would help us know the "right" way to interpret this (in my case,
specifically in the context of a LEED submittal).

Ashrae 90.1 (2004) Appendix G3.1.2.2 requires a baseline building to
have less than 300 unmet hours.  What exactly does this mean?

 

To illustrate my question:  assume you have a building with 301 zones,
and each zone has 1 unmet hour per year.  This gives you a total of 301
unmet hours, and requires you to increase your baseline equipment
capacity.  But you could argue that, on average, the building has only 1
unmet hour per year.

 

Have any of you run into this?  Is it addressed in an addendum
somewhere, etc?

 

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks,

I'd be very interested to read up on the previous discussions, but a
search of the archive didn't turn up much.  

 

90.1-2004, 90.1-2004 User's Manual, and 90.1-2007 all use "exceed" in
this sentence.  I don't have a copy of the '07 User's Manual, but even
if it does use the phrasing "difference of", I don't see how USGBC can
hold anyone to it; it is not written that way in the standard.  End of

Mike,

 

I appreciate you bringing this up.  This definition drives straight to
the heart of defining the issue-at-hand...  Since I kinda presented both
sides of the issue at once - I'd like to clarify where I stand regarding
what the correct interpretation should be.  

 

The logic is as follows:  If a modeled year has 8,760 hours, can there
be 10,000 unmet load hours?  By strict reading of the standard's
definition below, I would put my foot down stating there can only be
8,760, at most.  

 

By common practice however, it appears a majority (myself included) sum
unmet cooling/heating hours between the zones, even if they should fall
on the same modeled hour, against the intent of the standard.  

 

My pure speculation (for what it's worth, as a young EIT) is this
practice developed because eQuest BDL reports don't present the crunched
numbers in a way that makes the sum of unmet load hours, as intended by
90.1, easy to determine.  I wouldn't be shocked to learn other energy
modeling software packages generate LEED compliance summaries featuring
unmet load hour totals in sync with the real intent of ASHRAE 90.1.

 

If there's anything I've learned from going out on a limb, it's that I'm
sure to learn something whether I fall or not!

Jim,

 

That's actually a really good question that I was afraid to ask when I
first encountered it - kudos to you!  I've currently resolved to follow
what others seemed to be doing within and outside of my office:  Sum up
all unmet hours for cooling and heating between the zones just as you
describe.   In your example, I'd agree that the unmet hours of your 301
zone building total 301.

 

I do agree that this doesn't seem intuitively to be the intent of the
standard, however between what is suggested within 90.1, the LEED
handbook, and the LEED credit templates - I honestly can't see any clear
indication either way on which is the appropriate interpretation.  

 

I think the appropriate metric for ensuring appropriately sized systems
should be something like: "hours of the modeled year in which at least
one zone has an unmet cooling/heating load,"  but I think that was
avoided by all concerned parties because it's too wordy!

 

My acting interpretation, again referencing your example, is that all
systems of your 301 zone example affecting the zones with unmet
cooling/heating hours should have their heating/cooling/overall sizing
capacity ratios increased incrementally until the design hours fall
below 300 (and/or within 50 of the sum from the other model, depending
on your situation).

 

Afraid I'm only really adding to the discussion here without providing a
solid answer.  Would like to echo the desire to see anyone's experiences
that would help us know the "right" way to interpret this (in my case,
specifically in the context of a LEED submittal).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Ashrae 90.1 (2004) Appendix G3.1.2.2 requires a baseline building to
have less than 300 unmet hours.  What exactly does this mean?

 

To illustrate my question:  assume you have a building with 301 zones,
and each zone has 1 unmet hour per year.  This gives you a total of 301
unmet hours, and requires you to increase your baseline equipment
capacity.  But you could argue that, on average, the building has only 1
unmet hour per year.

 

Have any of you run into this?  Is it addressed in an addendum
somewhere, etc?

 

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks,

The USGBC received confirmation from ASHRAE that it is OK if the baseline unmet load hours exceed the proposed unmet load hours by more than 50, given that they are both below 300.

Any review comment stating anything to the contrary was written before the guidance was received and it is completely acceptable to reply to the review comment with a comment stating it is OK that the baseline exceeds the proposed by more than 50.

90.1-2004, 90.1-2004 User's Manual, and 90.1-2007 all use "exceed" in this sentence.  I don't have a copy of the '07 User's Manual, but even if it does use the phrasing "difference of", I don't see how USGBC can hold anyone to it; it is not written that way in the standard.

I use to agree with the statement and methodology you have provided. However, there have been discussions that definition of "exceed" is the "difference of". Hence making this statement false. In addition the ASHRAE User's Manual also indicates that it is the "difference of" and does not use the word exceed.

It's splitting hairs, but one item in the email from Ashu is not quite correct.  The following sentence is from his email, and the incorrect line is in bold:

 *   As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the unmet hours of the total building should be less than or equal to 300 hours and the difference in the base case and proposed case should be less than or equal to 50 hours.

What Ashrae actually says is, ". . .unmet load hours for the proposed design shall not exceed the number of load hours for the baseline building design by more than 50."

If you have a building where the baseline has 300 unmet hours, and the proposed has 0 unmet hours, no correction is needed.  A correction is only needed if the unmet hours in the proposed exceeds those in the baseline by more than 50.  (or if either exceeds 300).  Worded differently, if the baseline has 300 unmet hours, and the proposed system has 0 unmet hours, you do not need to make the baseline more stringent.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

I can confirm Mike's understanding of the DOE-2/eQUEST results.  To get the correct number of hours of unmet loads, people should MULTIPLY the Percent hours outside throttling range from BEPS or BEPU by the total annual "hours fans on" listed in report SS-E.

One other comment re: Ashu's write-up - I believe that (for DOE-2/eQUEST) a zone temperature has to be more than one degree outside the throttling range for that hour to be counted as an hour outside throttling range.  So for a zone with a heating thermostat setpoint of 72 and a 2 degree throttling range (=> 71-73 degree "throttling range"), the zone temperature would have to be LESS THAN 70 in order for that hour to be counted.

related info -
We are contemplating a change to the Air-Side HVAC Summary view in the eQUEST interface to report this total number of hours as opposed to just the percent in the totals section at the bottom of the report.
We have also just in the past several days (thanks to the efforts of Steve Gates) added precision to the percent hours outside throttling range reported on BEPS & BEPU and ALSO added separate reporting of hours any zone is either under cooled or under heated, intended for reporting to LEED submission templates.  Assuming no further changes (which is certainly not out of the question), future releases of DOE-2/eQUEST will report the following in the BEPS & BEPU reports:
         PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE =  4.45
         PERCENT OF HOURS ANY PLANT LOAD NOT SATISFIED                =  0.00
         HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE                =    98
         HOURS ANY ZONE BELOW HEATING THROTTLING RANGE                =    25

Ashu,

I am in agreement with everything you stated except possibly this;

"When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the percentage of total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the simulation is performed (not just the occupied hours)"

My understanding is that some simulation programs (DOE2 and eQuest in particular) report this as a percentage of hours that the fan is running. I could be wrong, and I am sure some of you DOE2 experts can comment on what is reported in the DOE2 BEPS report.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

Dear All,

Explanation of Unmet Hours is as follows:

Unmet Hours:
Unmet hours of a building are the summation of the number of hours when the heating or the cooling set point temperature of a zone is not met either by the HVAC system or by the plant.

Understanding/Interpreting/Calculating the number of unmet hours:

 *   Unmet hour is for a particular zone when the zone indoor temperature is higher than the heating or cooling set point specified in that hour.
 *   The number or the percentage of unmet hours in a building is usually given as one of the outputs of the simulation.
 *   Zone wise unmet can also be read from the various output files provided by the software used for simulation.
(Example:
Visual DOE: "SS-J System Peak Heating and Cooling Days" report &
Energy Plus: Output Variable, "Time Cooling Set point Not met")

 *   When two zones are unmet at the same hour, this will count to one unmet hour for the building.
 *   When two zones have unmet hours during different non overlapping times of a day, the total number of unmet hours in that day is the summation of these unmet hours of each zone. This total for the year should be considered as the total unmet hours of the building.
Example:
When each zone is unmet in the specified hours as beside,

Zone 1 unmet during:                        6          8          14        16
Zone 2 unmet during:                        6          8          12        16
Zone 3 unmet during:                        7          8          12        13

Total number of unmet hours of the building: 7 hrs and not 12hrs.
6          7          8          12        13        14        16


 *   When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the percentage of total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the simulation is performed (not just the occupied hours)
 *   As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the unmet hours of the total building should be less than or equal to 300 hours and the difference in the base case and proposed case should be less than or equal to 50 hours.
 *   If unmet load hours in the proposed building exceed the unmet load hours in the baseline building by more than 50, then the size of equipment in the baseline building shall be reduced incrementally, until the condition is satisfied.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

Ashrae 90.1 (2004) Appendix G3.1.2.2 requires a baseline building to have less than 300 unmet hours.  What exactly does this mean?

To illustrate my question:  assume you have a building with 301 zones, and each zone has 1 unmet hour per year.  This gives you a total of 301 unmet hours, and requires you to increase your baseline equipment capacity.  But you could argue that, on average, the building has only 1 unmet hour per year.

Have any of you run into this?  Is it addressed in an addendum somewhere, etc?

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks,

This is good to know because I know in the past USGBC did not allow it. I think it makes more sense now that they have gotten the OK from ASHRAE.

The USGBC received confirmation from ASHRAE that it is OK if the baseline unmet load hours exceed the proposed unmet load hours by more than 50, given that they are both below 300.  

 

Any review comment stating anything to the contrary was written before the guidance was received and it is completely acceptable to reply to the review comment with a comment stating it is OK that the baseline exceeds the proposed by more than 50.

I'd be very interested to read up on the previous discussions, but a search of the archive didn't turn up much.  

 

90.1-2004, 90.1-2004 User's Manual, and 90.1-2007 all use "exceed" in this sentence.  I don't have a copy of the '07 User's Manual, but even if it does use the phrasing "difference of", I don't see how USGBC can hold anyone to it; it is not written that way in the standard.  End of discussion. (Just my opinion.)

I use to agree with the statement and methodology you have provided. However, there have been discussions that definition of "exceed" is the "difference of". Hence making this statement false. In addition the ASHRAE User's Manual also indicates that it is the "difference of" and does not use the word exceed.

It's splitting hairs, but one item in the email from Ashu is not quite correct.  The following sentence is from his email, and the incorrect line is in bold:

*	As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the unmet hours of the total building should be less than or equal to 300 hours and the difference in the base case and proposed case should be less than or equal to 50 hours.

 

What Ashrae actually says is, ". . .unmet load hours for the proposed design shall not exceed the number of load hours for the baseline building design by more than 50."  

 

If you have a building where the baseline has 300 unmet hours, and the proposed has 0 unmet hours, no correction is needed.  A correction is only needed if the unmet hours in the proposed exceeds those in the baseline by more than 50.  (or if either exceeds 300).  Worded differently, if the baseline has 300 unmet hours, and the proposed system has 0 unmet hours, you do not need to make the baseline more stringent.

I can confirm Mike's understanding of the DOE-2/eQUEST results.  To get the correct number of hours of unmet loads, people should MULTIPLY the Percent hours outside throttling range from BEPS or BEPU by the total annual "hours fans on" listed in report SS-E.

One other comment re: Ashu's write-up - I believe that (for DOE-2/eQUEST) a zone temperature has to be more than one degree outside the throttling range for that hour to be counted as an hour outside throttling range.  So for a zone with a heating thermostat setpoint of 72 and a 2 degree throttling range (=> 71-73 degree "throttling range"), the zone temperature would have to be LESS THAN 70 in order for that hour to be counted.

related info -
We are contemplating a change to the Air-Side HVAC Summary view in the eQUEST interface to report this total number of hours as opposed to just the percent in the totals section at the bottom of the report.
We have also just in the past several days (thanks to the efforts of Steve Gates) added precision to the percent hours outside throttling range reported on BEPS & BEPU and ALSO added separate reporting of hours any zone is either under cooled or under heated, intended for reporting to LEED submission templates.  Assuming no further changes (which is certainly not out of the question), future releases of DOE-2/eQUEST will report the following in the BEPS & BEPU reports:
         PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE =  4.45
         PERCENT OF HOURS ANY PLANT LOAD NOT SATISFIED                =  0.00
         HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE                =    98
         HOURS ANY ZONE BELOW HEATING THROTTLING RANGE                =    25

Ashu,

 

I am in agreement with everything you stated except possibly this;

 

"When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the percentage of total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the simulation is performed (not just the occupied hours)"

 

My understanding is that some simulation programs (DOE2 and eQuest in particular) report this as a percentage of hours that the fan is running. I could be wrong, and I am sure some of you DOE2 experts can comment on what is reported in the DOE2 BEPS report.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Dear All,

 

Explanation of Unmet Hours is as follows:

 

Unmet Hours:

Unmet hours of a building are the summation of the number of hours when the heating or the cooling set point temperature of a zone is not met either by the HVAC system or by the plant.

Understanding/Interpreting/Calculating the number of unmet hours:

*	Unmet hour is for a particular zone when the zone indoor temperature is higher than the heating or cooling set point specified in that hour.
*	The number or the percentage of unmet hours in a building is usually given as one of the outputs of the simulation.
*	Zone wise unmet can also be read from the various output files provided by the software used for simulation.

(Example:  

Visual DOE: "SS-J System Peak Heating and Cooling Days" report &

Energy Plus: Output Variable, "Time Cooling Set point Not met")

*	When two zones are unmet at the same hour, this will count to one unmet hour for the building.
*	When two zones have unmet hours during different non overlapping times of a day, the total number of unmet hours in that day is the summation of these unmet hours of each zone. This total for the year should be considered as the total unmet hours of the building.

Example: 

When each zone is unmet in the specified hours as beside,

 

Zone 1 unmet during:                        6          8          14        16

Zone 2 unmet during:                        6          8          12        16

Zone 3 unmet during:                        7          8          12        13

            

Total number of unmet hours of the building: 7 hrs and not 12hrs.

6          7          8          12        13        14        16

 

*	When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the percentage of total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the simulation is performed (not just the occupied hours)
*	As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the unmet hours of the total building should be less than or equal to 300 hours and the difference in the base case and proposed case should be less than or equal to 50 hours.
*	If unmet load hours in the proposed building exceed the unmet load hours in the baseline building by more than 50, then the size of equipment in the baseline building shall be reduced incrementally, until the condition is satisfied.

I think eQuest and any DOE2 based software does report the hours of loads not being met as required by Appendix G. In the BEPS report it gives "PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE". My understanding of this number is that it is a percentage of scheduled fan run-time hours, so some calculation may be necessary.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Mike,

 

I appreciate you bringing this up.  This definition drives straight to the heart of defining the issue-at-hand...  Since I kinda presented both sides of the issue at once - I'd like to clarify where I stand regarding what the correct interpretation should be.  

 

The logic is as follows:  If a modeled year has 8,760 hours, can there be 10,000 unmet load hours?  By strict reading of the standard's definition below, I would put my foot down stating there can only be 8,760, at most.  

 

By common practice however, it appears a majority (myself included) sum unmet cooling/heating hours between the zones, even if they should fall on the same modeled hour, against the intent of the standard.  

 

My pure speculation (for what it's worth, as a young EIT) is this practice developed because eQuest BDL reports don't present the crunched numbers in a way that makes the sum of unmet load hours, as intended by 90.1, easy to determine.  I wouldn't be shocked to learn other energy modeling software packages generate LEED compliance summaries featuring unmet load hour totals in sync with the real intent of ASHRAE 90.1.

 

If there's anything I've learned from going out on a limb, it's that I'm sure to learn something whether I fall or not!

 

~Nick

Nick,

 

Your interpretation is the correct one. According to the definitions in Standard 90.1.

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the thermostat setpoint range.

Jim,

 

That's actually a really good question that I was afraid to ask when I first encountered it - kudos to you!  I've currently resolved to follow what others seemed to be doing within and outside of my office:  Sum up all unmet hours for cooling and heating between the zones just as you describe.   In your example, I'd agree that the unmet hours of your 301 zone building total 301.

 

I do agree that this doesn't seem intuitively to be the intent of the standard, however between what is suggested within 90.1, the LEED handbook, and the LEED credit templates - I honestly can't see any clear indication either way on which is the appropriate interpretation.  

 

I think the appropriate metric for ensuring appropriately sized systems should be something like: "hours of the modeled year in which at least one zone has an unmet cooling/heating load,"  but I think that was avoided by all concerned parties because it's too wordy!

 

My acting interpretation, again referencing your example, is that all systems of your 301 zone example affecting the zones with unmet cooling/heating hours should have their heating/cooling/overall sizing capacity ratios increased incrementally until the design hours fall below 300 (and/or within 50 of the sum from the other model, depending on your situation).

 

Afraid I'm only really adding to the discussion here without providing a solid answer.  Would like to echo the desire to see anyone's experiences that would help us know the "right" way to interpret this (in my case, specifically in the context of a LEED submittal).

	input
Message-ID: <B9A3AA6F98276B4EB15DECA51DB7F85101A6B838@smain07.IBECE07.local>

I?m working on a two-building university dorm with eight and six floors respectively. (using EnergyPro 5)

 

There are four DHW boilers ? two of 399 MBTU capacity and two of 900 MBTU capacity.

 

I am only allowed to enter one DHW boiler type and can then add a multiplier.

 

What would be the appropriate way to model this most accurately?

 

I was thinking of taking a weighed average value and inputting that with a boiler multiplier of four.

 

This would require more than a little explanation for LEED and Plan Check

 

Thoughts?

 

Thanks kindly,

Hi
All,

?

I
need to change some values (Tvis)?in the equest glass library for a
particular glass type code (2800, 2801). I tried to change this in the BDL file
for the particular project, but it appears that inp and bdl file are reading
from a central location, and the changes I make are replaced by the library
default values when I run the simulation. I cannot use the Windows 5 route as
the glass type I am trying to modify is an electrochromic glass and hence only
glass types from the glass library can be used. 

?

Any
pointers on where the root glass library info is located and on how to change
the library Tvis value for a particular library glass type code??

?

Thanks

I am new to eQuest and want to utilize it for my thesis research.  I have a
created a model of an office building in detailed edit mode, but when I run
the simulation there is no apparent cooling or heating loads.  The report
shows no energy and no loads.  I have combed through my model and can't
figure it out.

Hey Chris, 

 

How are you doing?

 

There?s an EE4 modeling guide (a software in Canada that is similar to Energy Pro) that explains how to do this. I?ll give you an excerpt that may help.

 

4.2.2 Multiple Boilers

Multiple central boilers are often installed to provide better part load performance or back-up capacity in case of equipment failure or maintenance. Boilers that are strictly for back up, that is kept off and must be manually switched to the operating boiler, should be ignored. In all other cases (lead/lag boilers, load/peaking boilers) enter all boilers. In EE4, it is assumed that the multiple boilers have the same capacity and performance characteristics. (It is not possible to

define boilers of different sizes or efficiencies within the same heating loop). Only separate heating plants, which serve distinct parts of the building, can accommodate different boilers. 

 

4.2.3 Multiple Boilers of Different Efficiencies

At present, EE4 cannot model multiple boilers of different operating efficiencies. If the boilers are

operated to provide uniform run hours, determine the capacity-weighted average efficiency.

Example: 2 boilers:

? boiler 1: output capacity = 450 kW, efficiency = 88%

? boiler 2: output capacity = 150 kW, efficiency = 72%

Solution:

Boilers 1 and 2 would be combined as follows:

? capacity = (450 + 150) / 2 boilers = 300 kW each

? efficiency = (450 * 0.88 + 150 * 0.72) / (450 + 150) = 0.84 (84%)

Entered plant boiler multiplier = 2, each boiler: output = 300, efficiency = 0.84, sequencing = 270

kW

 

This lead/lag and peaking boiler may be confusing and the exact method may not be applicable to Energy Pro, but it may give you ideas. Let me know if you have further questions.

 

For lead/lag and peaking boiler cases, the following procedure is to be followed:

Note: This procedure involves 2 EE4 simulations. The first is used to determine the average boiler efficiency. The second is used for determining compliance for NRCan?s validation (NRCan validation is **similar** to Title-24 compliance). **similar in the sense that you need to comply to its requirements.

 

1. Complete Steps 1a) to b) to create a table such as that shown below (I can send you the EE4 modeling guide if desired).

 

Step 1a) List the boilers in order of their firing sequence, with the thermal efficiency and output capacity of each. The example below uses three boilers: B-1 is a 500 MBH condensing boiler with rated thermal efficiency = 95%; B-2 and B-3 are 800 MBH non-condensing boilers with rated thermal efficiencies = 80%. (B-1 is the lead boiler. B-2 will fire second, and B-3 third.) 

 

Step 1b) Determine the cumulative plant capacity at each stage of the firing sequence. In the example below, only B-1 fires during Sequence 1, so the cumulative plant capacity is 500 MBH. During Sequence 2, both B-1 and B-2 fire, so the capacity is 1,300 MBH. During Sequence 3, all three boilers fire, so the capacity is 2,100 MBH.

 

Step 1c) Determine the percent of the total plant capacity that can be met by each stage of

the sequence. In the example below, the total plant capacity is 2,100 MBH. So

Sequence 1 can provide 500/2100 = 24%, Sequence 2 can provide 62%, and

Sequence 3 can provide 2100/2100 = 100%.

 

Step 1d) Determine the Plant Thermal Efficiency of each stage of the sequence. This is done by calculating the capacity-weighted average thermal efficiency of all the boilers that fire during a sequence. In the example below, in Sequence 1, only B-1 fires, so the Plant Thermal Efficiency for that stage is 95.0%. In Sequence 2, both B-1 and B-2 fire, so the Plant Thermal Efficiency is: (95x500 + 80x800) / (500 + 800) = 85.8%.

2. In EE4, set the boiler thermal efficiency to 80%, and make sure the total boiler plant output capacity is equal to the total plant capacity calculated above. (For the example above, this would be 2,100 MBH.)

3. Set the EE4 options so that the Plant PV-A and PS-C reports are created and the DOE-2 output files are not deleted when the simulation is run.

4. Run the simulation for the proposed building.

5. Open the DOE-2 ?.sim? file for the proposed building and locate the PV-A report. Check that the total installed boiler capacity matches the Total Plant Capacity from the table above. If it is not, then return to Step 2 and correct the boiler capacity entered into EE4.

6. Complete Steps 6a) to 6e) to create a table such as that shown below.

6a) In the DOE-2 ?.sim? file, locate the PS-C report. Use the LOWER line of data for theboiler to create a table of part-load hours as shown below.

6b) For each part load range, enter the Plant Efficiency in the table below based on thecalculations in the above table. (Use the column ?Percent of Total Plant Capacity? inthe above table to determine which efficiency corresponds to each part-load range.If the ?Percent of Total Plant Capacity? falls within a Part Load Range, switch to the next higher Sequence.) Step 1a) Step 1b) Step 1c) Step 1d) 

6c) In the following table, multiply the ?Hours? column by the ?Efficiency? column.

6d) Sum the Hours column and the ?Hours x Efficiency? column.

6e) Divide the sum of ?Hours x Efficiency? by the sum of ?Hours? to determinethe average plant thermal efficiency. (For the above example, it is 93.3%.)

7. In EE4, enter the boiler efficiency determined in step 6e).

8. Run the simulation for the proposed and reference buildings to determine compliance forNRCan?s validation.

 

I hope this is helpful.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modeling multiple different DHW boilers with only oneinput

 

I?m working on a two-building university dorm with eight and six floors respectively. (using EnergyPro 5)

 

There are four DHW boilers ? two of 399 MBTU capacity and two of 900 MBTU capacity.

 

I am only allowed to enter one DHW boiler type and can then add a multiplier.

 

What would be the appropriate way to model this most accurately?

 

I was thinking of taking a weighed average value and inputting that with a boiler multiplier of four.

 

This would require more than a little explanation for LEED and Plan Check

 

Thoughts?

 

Thanks kindly,

You might like to refer this:
http://www.greenbuildinggenie.com/tips/leed-issues/item/53-ashrae-is-applicable-to-cluster-or-individual-bldg

In my opinion, ASHRAE 90.1 2004  is applicable to individual buildings, so
the baseline is different for different buildings as per their area and
number of stories. I think you should not sum the areas and then find the
baseline HVAC system.  Take baseline system for each building separately and
then check the compliance for each building independently.

For LEED energy points you can follow Application Guide for Multiple
Buildings and On-Campus Building Projects (AGMBC) available at:
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=1097

It says:

EA Prerequisite 2: Minimum Energy Performance
Requirements : Each building in a project must independently meet the
requirements of this prerequisite.

EA Credit 1: Optimize Energy Performance

Requirements:
This credit applies to each building within the project scope. To receive a
single rating for a group of buildings, use a weighted average for the group
of buildings based on their conditioned square footage, or aggregate the
data into one PRM calculation, so that performance is achieved by buildings
of varying sizes within a certifying group. Each building must still meet EA
Prerequisite 1 and may receive its own rating if that is desired.

Some guesses...  you might see if any of the following help you out?  I'd be curious to hear the result!

 

Try modifying the transmittance within the eQuest detailed interface.  Go to Building Shell tab, scroll down your component tree until you see glass types, click any of them and hit the Spreadsheet tab.  The Tvis values are there for your tinkering...  do those also reset when you run a simulation? 

 

If they do still reset, try from the same view to change from "Library" to "Simplified" input.  This appears to grey out the Library Column.  

 

If that doesn't work... you might try right-clicking any cell, select "Tutorials and Reference"  ?  "DOE2 Glass Library.xls"  That opens up an excel file installed to your computer alongside eQuest... modifying it might give the desired results, but I'm unsure...

A few things to consider:
Are the buildings part of the same project or building permit? - if separate then 90.1 would apply to them individually.  This is regardless of grouping them into one LEED project for instance.
The definition of "building" in 90.1-2004 is "a structure wholly or partially enclosed within exterior walls..." - so even if combined into one building permit, these three might be treated as separate buildings for system selection purposes, especially if the predominant usage for the three is different based on Exception (a) to G3.1.1 (assuming  you are using the Performance Rating Method and not ECB since you are discussing the building sizes).
Hope this helps, good luck!

I have done a small experiment; I created a block model and simulated it on
auto sizing.
There were no unmet hours in this case. Hence,I manually decreased the
supply cfm (flow/area) in the zone which started increasing the unmet hours.
The % of unmet was varying as a % of number of hours HVAC fan is ON.The cfm
was decreased till the unmet hours were 100% (cooling unmet). In this case
the total number of unmet hours of the building are similar to the total
number of hours the system fan is ON. I changed the cooling setpoint
temperature when the system fan is OFF and this had shown no effect on unmet
hours.

These percentage unmet hours (in Visual DOE)  hence seem to be the %  of the
total number of hours the HVAC fan is ON.

We also interpreted the unmet loads hours as Sureka's table illustrates below. We believe this to be the correct interpretation and have included tools in the Virtual Environment for assessing unmet load hours accordingly. The tools counts only occupied hours for each zone (per the schedule for that particular zone), and unmet load hours are determined in keeping with the controls throttling ranges established by the user for heating and cooling of individual zones. The occupied hours and set points can thus vary from one zone to another, without double-counting a particular hour during which two or more zones are out of range. That said, in support of other needs and interpretations, we also provide means for users to count unmet loads or other hourly bin data for any set of hours in the day and to total all hours or just the non-coincident hours via a logical ?OR? test

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

I also interpret the 90.1 PRM definition as Sureka's table illustrates. I imagine the intent of the original writers was that you would get about one hour/day for either morning startup or at/near design conditions, when MANY zones might be "outside the throttling range" during that hour. Any other interpretation penalizes buildings with more zones. And it should not matter whether Zones 1,2 and 3 are served by the same system or separate systems.

 

For DOE2/eQuest, as far as I know, this is essentially how the BEPS % unmet hours are determined, though apparently the percent references system "on" hours. I THINK this is calculated as a fraction of the system with the greatest "on" hours, but I'm not sure how cycling "on" is treated. I think that if a model includes any system, even a tiny virtual independent system, with continuous operation, then the overall % from BEPS can be multiplied by 8760 (hopefully NOT 8760 + design day hours)!

 

Unless it has been added to the newest versions of eQuest, there are NO DOE2/eQuest summary outputs which decompose "unmet hours" into heating and cooling for the BUILDING, as requested by the PRM and EAc1 forms. However this decomposition is not specifically required by the language of the standard. AND these #s might not necessarily be additive, a good reason NOT to try to decompose and then sum these. During startup on a winter day, many interior zones might be "undercooled" while many exterior zones are "underheated," yielding ONE unmet load hour, but also ONE hour cooling loads not met and ONE hour heating loads not met... which would appear to become TWO hours if entered separately then summed.

P.S. Before increasing system or zone capacities, it's always wise to check myriad other inputs to assure that some schedule or setting hasn't turned off the heating or cooling or reset SA temps in some unanticipated fashion.

The same information is shown in the below table for one particular day- suppose Jan 1st

As seen in the table:

Total unmet hours in the building is not the sum of number of unmet hours in each zone (which is 12hrs) but is the sum of number of unmet hours of the building (which is 7hrs).

 

I am also attaching the table as an image.In case the formatting goes wrong in the mail, the attached image can be referred.

Am I missing something or does this table and the corresponding answer (7 unmet hours) not make sense.

Zone 1 unmet during: 6 8 14 16

Zone 2 unmet during: 6 8 12 16

Zone 3 unmet during: 7 8 12 13

If the columns (hours outside of throttling range) all represent simultaneous hours in the model then wouldn?t the total number of hours be the sum of the maximum number of hours for each time period? (7+8+14+16=45 hours outside of range) I have looked at the chart multiple ways and do not see how seven (7) could ever be the correct value.

Yes, projects with hundreds of zones may be penalized however ASHRAE allows similar spaces(orientation, load , HVAC system) to be combined into a single zone which can reduce the impact of this issue.

I personally sum all of the hours ANY zone is outside of range without regard to when the time period is. I feel that this is the most accurate method of correctly sizing the HVAC systems.

Dear All,

Explanation of Unmet Hours is as follows:

Unmet Hours:

Unmet hours of a building are the summation of the number of hours when the heating or the cooling set point temperature of a zone is not met either by the HVAC system or by the plant.

Understanding/Interpreting/Calculating the number of unmet hours:

*	Unmet hour is for a particular zone when the zone indoor temperature is higher than the heating or cooling set point specified in that hour. 
*	The number or the percentage of unmet hours in a building is usually given as one of the outputs of the simulation. 
*	Zone wise unmet can also be read from the various output files provided by the software used for simulation. 

(Example: 

Visual DOE: ?SS-J System Peak Heating and Cooling Days? report &

Energy Plus: Output Variable, ?Time Cooling Set point Not met?)

*	When two zones are unmet at the same hour, this will count to one unmet hour for the building. 
*	When two zones have unmet hours during different non overlapping times of a day, the total number of unmet hours in that day is the summation of these unmet hours of each zone. This total for the year should be considered as the total unmet hours of the building. 

Example: 

When each zone is unmet in the specified hours as beside,

Zone 1 unmet during: 6 8 14 16

Zone 2 unmet during: 6 8 12 16

Zone 3 unmet during: 7 8 12 13

Total number of unmet hours of the building: 7 hrs and not 12hrs.

6 7 8 12 13 14 16

*	When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the percentage of total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the simulation is performed (not just the occupied hours) 
*	As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the unmet hours of the total building should be less than or equal to 300 hours and the difference in the base case and proposed case should be less than or equal to 50 hours. 
*	If unmet load hours in the proposed building exceed the unmet load hours in the baseline building by more than 50, then the size of equipment in the baseline building shall be reduced incrementally, until the condition is satisfied.

I think eQuest and any DOE2 based software does report the hours of loads not being met as required by Appendix G. In the BEPS report it gives ?PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE?. My understanding of this number is that it is a percentage of scheduled fan run-time hours, so some calculation may be necessary.

Mike,

I appreciate you bringing this up. This definition drives straight to the heart of defining the issue-at-hand? Since I kinda presented both sides of the issue at once ? I?d like to clarify where I stand regarding what the correct interpretation should be. 

The logic is as follows: If a modeled year has 8,760 hours, can there be 10,000 unmet load hours? By strict reading of the standard?s definition below, I would put my foot down stating there can only be 8,760, at most. 

By common practice however, it appears a majority (myself included) sum unmet cooling/heating hours between the zones, even if they should fall on the same modeled hour, against the intent of the standard. 

My pure speculation (for what it?s worth, as a young EIT) is this practice developed because eQuest BDL reports don?t present the crunched numbers in a way that makes the sum of unmet load hours, as intended by 90.1, easy to determine. I wouldn?t be shocked to learn other energy modeling software packages generate LEED compliance summaries featuring unmet load hour totals in sync with the real intent of ASHRAE 90.1.

If there?s anything I?ve learned from going out on a limb, it?s that I?m sure to learn something whether I fall or not!

Nick,

Your interpretation is the correct one. According to the definitions in Standard 90.1.

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the thermostat setpoint range.

Jim,

That?s actually a really good question that I was afraid to ask when I first encountered it ? kudos to you! I?ve currently resolved to follow what others seemed to be doing within and outside of my office: Sum up all unmet hours for cooling and heating between the zones just as you describe. In your example, I?d agree that the unmet hours of your 301 zone building total 301.

I do agree that this doesn?t seem intuitively to be the intent of the standard, however between what is suggested within 90.1, the LEED handbook, and the LEED credit templates ? I honestly can?t see any clear indication either way on which is the appropriate interpretation. 

I think the appropriate metric for ensuring appropriately sized systems should be something like: ?hours of the modeled year in which at least one zone has an unmet cooling/heating load,? but I think that was avoided by all concerned parties because it?s too wordy!

My acting interpretation, again referencing your example, is that all systems of your 301 zone example affecting the zones with unmet cooling/heating hours should have their heating/cooling/overall sizing capacity ratios increased incrementally until the design hours fall below 300 (and/or within 50 of the sum from the other model, depending on your situation).

Afraid I?m only really adding to the discussion here without providing a solid answer. Would like to echo the desire to see anyone?s experiences that would help us know the ?right? way to interpret this (in my case, specifically in the context of a LEED submittal).

I can confirm Mike's understanding of the DOE-2/eQUEST results.  To get
the correct number of hours of unmet loads, people should MULTIPLY the
Percent hours outside throttling range from BEPS or BEPU by the total
annual "hours fans on" listed in report SS-E.

One other comment re: Ashu's write-up - I believe that (for
DOE-2/eQUEST) a zone temperature has to be more than one degree outside
the throttling range for that hour to be counted as an hour outside
throttling range.  So for a zone with a heating thermostat setpoint of
72 and a 2 degree throttling range (=> 71-73 degree "throttling range"),
the zone temperature would have to be LESS THAN 70 in order for that
hour to be counted.

related info -
We are contemplating a change to the Air-Side HVAC Summary view in the
eQUEST interface to report this total number of hours as opposed to just
the percent in the totals section at the bottom of the report.
We have also just in the past several days (thanks to the efforts of
Steve Gates) added precision to the percent hours outside throttling
range reported on BEPS & BEPU and ALSO added separate reporting of hours
any zone is either under cooled or under heated, intended for reporting
to LEED submission templates.  Assuming no further changes (which is
certainly not out of the question), future releases of DOE-2/eQUEST will
report the following in the BEPS & BEPU reports:
         PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE =
4.45
         PERCENT OF HOURS ANY PLANT LOAD NOT SATISFIED                =
0.00
         HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE                =
98
         HOURS ANY ZONE BELOW HEATING THROTTLING RANGE                =

Ashu,

 

I am in agreement with everything you stated except possibly this;

 

"When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the percentage of
total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the simulation is
performed (not just the occupied hours)"

 

My understanding is that some simulation programs (DOE2 and eQuest in
particular) report this as a percentage of hours that the fan is
running. I could be wrong, and I am sure some of you DOE2 experts can
comment on what is reported in the DOE2 BEPS report.

Dear All,

 

Explanation of Unmet Hours is as follows:

 

Unmet Hours:

Unmet hours of a building are the summation of the number of hours when
the heating or the cooling set point temperature of a zone is not met
either by the HVAC system or by the plant.

Understanding/Interpreting/Calculating the number of unmet hours:

*	Unmet hour is for a particular zone when the zone indoor
temperature is higher than the heating or cooling set point specified in
that hour.
*	The number or the percentage of unmet hours in a building is
usually given as one of the outputs of the simulation.
*	Zone wise unmet can also be read from the various output files
provided by the software used for simulation.

(Example:  

Visual DOE: "SS-J System Peak Heating and Cooling Days" report &

Energy Plus: Output Variable, "Time Cooling Set point Not met")

*	When two zones are unmet at the same hour, this will count to
one unmet hour for the building.
*	When two zones have unmet hours during different non overlapping
times of a day, the total number of unmet hours in that day is the
summation of these unmet hours of each zone. This total for the year
should be considered as the total unmet hours of the building.

Example: 

When each zone is unmet in the specified hours as beside,

 

Zone 1 unmet during:                        6          8          14
16

Zone 2 unmet during:                        6          8          12
16

Zone 3 unmet during:                        7          8          12
13

            

Total number of unmet hours of the building: 7 hrs and not 12hrs.

6          7          8          12        13        14        16

 

*	When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the
percentage of total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the
simulation is performed (not just the occupied hours)
*	As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the unmet hours of the total building
should be less than or equal to 300 hours and the difference in the base
case and proposed case should be less than or equal to 50 hours.
*	If unmet load hours in the proposed building exceed the unmet
load hours in the baseline building by more than 50, then the size of
equipment in the baseline building shall be reduced incrementally, until
the condition is satisfied.

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the

That is what I have done in the past as well, but I don't think this method accounts for simultaneous "zones" being unmet.  In some cases you may be counting the same hour for multiple zones which based on the discussion so far should only count for a single hour.  I am not aware of any simple method currently to get a true list of non-simultaneous unmet load hours for the building as a hole from equest.

Can't you just get the hours unmet from the SS-R report (Zone Under Heated Hours, Zone Under Cooled Hours)?  That's what I've always used and haven't had a problem yet anyway.

I can confirm Mike's understanding of the DOE-2/eQUEST results.  To get the correct number of hours of unmet loads, people should MULTIPLY the Percent hours outside throttling range from BEPS or BEPU by the total annual "hours fans on" listed in report SS-E.

One other comment re: Ashu's write-up - I believe that (for DOE-2/eQUEST) a zone temperature has to be more than one degree outside the throttling range for that hour to be counted as an hour outside throttling range.  So for a zone with a heating thermostat setpoint of 72 and a 2 degree throttling range (=> 71-73 degree "throttling range"), the zone temperature would have to be LESS THAN 70 in order for that hour to be counted.

related info -
We are contemplating a change to the Air-Side HVAC Summary view in the eQUEST interface to report this total number of hours as opposed to just the percent in the totals section at the bottom of the report.
We have also just in the past several days (thanks to the efforts of Steve Gates) added precision to the percent hours outside throttling range reported on BEPS & BEPU and ALSO added separate reporting of hours any zone is either under cooled or under heated, intended for reporting to LEED submission templates.  Assuming no further changes (which is certainly not out of the question), future releases of DOE-2/eQUEST will report the following in the BEPS & BEPU reports:
         PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE =  4.45
         PERCENT OF HOURS ANY PLANT LOAD NOT SATISFIED                =  0.00
         HOURS ANY ZONE ABOVE COOLING THROTTLING RANGE                =    98
         HOURS ANY ZONE BELOW HEATING THROTTLING RANGE                =    25

Dear All,

Explanation of Unmet Hours is as follows:

Unmet Hours:
Unmet hours of a building are the summation of the number of hours when the heating or the cooling set point temperature of a zone is not met either by the HVAC system or by the plant.

Understanding/Interpreting/Calculating the number of unmet hours:

 *   Unmet hour is for a particular zone when the zone indoor temperature is higher than the heating or cooling set point specified in that hour.
 *   The number or the percentage of unmet hours in a building is usually given as one of the outputs of the simulation.
 *   Zone wise unmet can also be read from the various output files provided by the software used for simulation.
(Example:
Visual DOE: "SS-J System Peak Heating and Cooling Days" report &
Energy Plus: Output Variable, "Time Cooling Set point Not met")

 *   When two zones are unmet at the same hour, this will count to one unmet hour for the building.
 *   When two zones have unmet hours during different non overlapping times of a day, the total number of unmet hours in that day is the summation of these unmet hours of each zone. This total for the year should be considered as the total unmet hours of the building.
Example:
When each zone is unmet in the specified hours as beside,

Zone 1 unmet during:                        6          8          14        16
Zone 2 unmet during:                        6          8          12        16
Zone 3 unmet during:                        7          8          12        13

Total number of unmet hours of the building: 7 hrs and not 12hrs.
6          7          8          12        13        14        16


 *   When percentage of unmet is specified, than this is the percentage of total number of hours (1 year- 8760 hours) for which the simulation is performed (not just the occupied hours)
 *   As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the unmet hours of the total building should be less than or equal to 300 hours and the difference in the base case and proposed case should be less than or equal to 50 hours.
 *   If unmet load hours in the proposed building exceed the unmet load hours in the baseline building by more than 50, then the size of equipment in the baseline building shall be reduced incrementally, until the condition is satisfied.

I think eQuest and any DOE2 based software does report the hours of loads not being met as required by Appendix G. In the BEPS report it gives "PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE". My understanding of this number is that it is a percentage of scheduled fan run-time hours, so some calculation may be necessary.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

Mike,

I appreciate you bringing this up.  This definition drives straight to the heart of defining the issue-at-hand...  Since I kinda presented both sides of the issue at once - I'd like to clarify where I stand regarding what the correct interpretation should be.

The logic is as follows:  If a modeled year has 8,760 hours, can there be 10,000 unmet load hours?  By strict reading of the standard's definition below, I would put my foot down stating there can only be 8,760, at most.

By common practice however, it appears a majority (myself included) sum unmet cooling/heating hours between the zones, even if they should fall on the same modeled hour, against the intent of the standard.

My pure speculation (for what it's worth, as a young EIT) is this practice developed because eQuest BDL reports don't present the crunched numbers in a way that makes the sum of unmet load hours, as intended by 90.1, easy to determine.  I wouldn't be shocked to learn other energy modeling software packages generate LEED compliance summaries featuring unmet load hour totals in sync with the real intent of ASHRAE 90.1.

If there's anything I've learned from going out on a limb, it's that I'm sure to learn something whether I fall or not!

Your interpretation is the correct one. According to the definitions in Standard 90.1.

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the thermostat setpoint range.

Jim,

That's actually a really good question that I was afraid to ask when I first encountered it - kudos to you!  I've currently resolved to follow what others seemed to be doing within and outside of my office:  Sum up all unmet hours for cooling and heating between the zones just as you describe.   In your example, I'd agree that the unmet hours of your 301 zone building total 301.

I do agree that this doesn't seem intuitively to be the intent of the standard, however between what is suggested within 90.1, the LEED handbook, and the LEED credit templates - I honestly can't see any clear indication either way on which is the appropriate interpretation.

I think the appropriate metric for ensuring appropriately sized systems should be something like: "hours of the modeled year in which at least one zone has an unmet cooling/heating load,"  but I think that was avoided by all concerned parties because it's too wordy!

My acting interpretation, again referencing your example, is that all systems of your 301 zone example affecting the zones with unmet cooling/heating hours should have their heating/cooling/overall sizing capacity ratios increased incrementally until the design hours fall below 300 (and/or within 50 of the sum from the other model, depending on your situation).

Afraid I'm only really adding to the discussion here without providing a solid answer.  Would like to echo the desire to see anyone's experiences that would help us know the "right" way to interpret this (in my case, specifically in the context of a LEED submittal).

Ashrae 90.1 (2004) Appendix G3.1.2.2 requires a baseline building to have less than 300 unmet hours.  What exactly does this mean?

To illustrate my question:  assume you have a building with 301 zones, and each zone has 1 unmet hour per year.  This gives you a total of 301 unmet hours, and requires you to increase your baseline equipment capacity.  But you could argue that, on average, the building has only 1 unmet hour per year.

Have any of you run into this?  Is it addressed in an addendum somewhere, etc?

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks,

Jason,

 

If you take the numbers from the SS-R report, you do not know if unmet
hours in one zone occur at the same hour as unmet hours in another zone
(as in Ashu's & Fred's example yesterday).  Someone else said that the
SS-R report only shows unmet hours when the fan is running.  Finally,
for a building with many zones, you'd have to look at a lot of reports,
compared to just the BEPS/BEPU.

 

I'd love to see a summary like what Scott says they're working on.  That
would be great!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

I think eQuest and any DOE2 based software does report the hours of
loads not being met as required by Appendix G. In the BEPS report it
gives "PERCENT OF HOURS ANY SYSTEM ZONE OUTSIDE OF THROTTLING RANGE". My
understanding of this number is that it is a percentage of scheduled fan
run-time hours, so some calculation may be necessary.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Mike,

 

I appreciate you bringing this up.  This definition drives straight to
the heart of defining the issue-at-hand...  Since I kinda presented both
sides of the issue at once - I'd like to clarify where I stand regarding
what the correct interpretation should be.  

 

The logic is as follows:  If a modeled year has 8,760 hours, can there
be 10,000 unmet load hours?  By strict reading of the standard's
definition below, I would put my foot down stating there can only be
8,760, at most.  

 

By common practice however, it appears a majority (myself included) sum
unmet cooling/heating hours between the zones, even if they should fall
on the same modeled hour, against the intent of the standard.  

 

My pure speculation (for what it's worth, as a young EIT) is this
practice developed because eQuest BDL reports don't present the crunched
numbers in a way that makes the sum of unmet load hours, as intended by
90.1, easy to determine.  I wouldn't be shocked to learn other energy
modeling software packages generate LEED compliance summaries featuring
unmet load hour totals in sync with the real intent of ASHRAE 90.1.

 

If there's anything I've learned from going out on a limb, it's that I'm
sure to learn something whether I fall or not!

Nick,

 

Your interpretation is the correct one. According to the definitions in
Standard 90.1.

unmet load hour: an hour in which one or more zones is outside of the
thermostat setpoint range.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Jim,

 

That's actually a really good question that I was afraid to ask when I
first encountered it - kudos to you!  I've currently resolved to follow
what others seemed to be doing within and outside of my office:  Sum up
all unmet hours for cooling and heating between the zones just as you
describe.   In your example, I'd agree that the unmet hours of your 301
zone building total 301.

 

I do agree that this doesn't seem intuitively to be the intent of the
standard, however between what is suggested within 90.1, the LEED
handbook, and the LEED credit templates - I honestly can't see any clear
indication either way on which is the appropriate interpretation.  

 

I think the appropriate metric for ensuring appropriately sized systems
should be something like: "hours of the modeled year in which at least
one zone has an unmet cooling/heating load,"  but I think that was
avoided by all concerned parties because it's too wordy!

 

My acting interpretation, again referencing your example, is that all
systems of your 301 zone example affecting the zones with unmet
cooling/heating hours should have their heating/cooling/overall sizing
capacity ratios increased incrementally until the design hours fall
below 300 (and/or within 50 of the sum from the other model, depending
on your situation).

 

Afraid I'm only really adding to the discussion here without providing a
solid answer.  Would like to echo the desire to see anyone's experiences
that would help us know the "right" way to interpret this (in my case,
specifically in the context of a LEED submittal).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Ashrae 90.1 - Unmet hours

 

Ashrae 90.1 (2004) Appendix G3.1.2.2 requires a baseline building to
have less than 300 unmet hours.  What exactly does this mean?

 

To illustrate my question:  assume you have a building with 301 zones,
and each zone has 1 unmet hour per year.  This gives you a total of 301
unmet hours, and requires you to increase your baseline equipment
capacity.  But you could argue that, on average, the building has only 1
unmet hour per year.

 

Have any of you run into this?  Is it addressed in an addendum
somewhere, etc?

 

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks,

Hi All

 

I am working on an upgrade to a building that uses district energy and
is pursuing certification under LEED NC 3.0.  

 

I am aware of the document "Required Treatment of District Thermal

(http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176
<http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176> )

 

Does anyone know if this document is applicable for projects registered
in LEED NC 3.0, or if there have been any updates/changes to it?

 

Thank you all

The document does not extend itself beyond NC v 2.2 and For Schools.
On the USGBC website, the document posted under the NC v 2.2 section not under the All Rating System sections.
The BD+C short guide (http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=5546) does not mention the document.

Can someone check the full Green Building Design and Construction Reference Guide, 2009 Edition  and a LEED 2009 EAc1 Template?

My gut and proposals are assuming it is still in force for 2009, but I do not see that in writing anywhere.

As far as I know "District Thermal Energy" is to be treated the same in NC 3.0. I have had limited contact with the few NC 3.0 projects in the works that are pursuing this path, and they haven't had any guidance to do anything different.

Gotta love the new secret LEED CIR process that doesn't let you know what's right or wrong so we can spend lots of our clients money pursuing  paths that may not pay off.

Thanks to everyone who has replied to this.  There is indeed on page 268
the statement:

 

"Projects with district CHP must follow all the requirements in Required
Treatment of District Thermal Energy (
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176).

 

Didn't read it carefully enough the first time around.

 

Thanks again

The USGBC has just updated their website in response to this Bldg-Sim list
string.  At http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1762#2009, the
website states:

District Thermal Energy
Treatment<http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=4176>(PDF) --
Treatment of Energy & Atmosphere prerequisites and credits for LEED
buildings that are connected to a district thermal energy system. LEED 2009
projects should follow the guidance in this document until the LEED 2009 DES
document is posted (estimated Q4 2009). Please note that any mention of the
2-point minimum in this document should be translated to apply towards the
minimum EAp2 prerequisite for LEED 2009.

Best Regards,
Gail Hampsmire

Message-ID: <83996EE70003D04B830E1C4A5E6688CEC6C5A1@PATHMAIL2.pathfinderengineers.com>

A number of people replied to my question from last week. Thanks!
The list was not copied, so I'll summarize the responses:
 
Use EnergyPlus or TRNSYS to simulate earth-to-air heat exchangers.
Use the GAEA program - free trial download here:
            http://nesa1.uni-siegen.de/index.htm?/softlab/gaea_e.htm
Designs must allow for automatic removal of condensation (such as by installing earth tubes at an angle of at least 2-3 degrees).
Earth tubes can provide a consistent 3-5?C temperature rise in winter preheating applications.
A list of references is attached.
 
Regards,
Bill

Subject: Earth tubes/tunnels/channels for building retrofit
 
I am performing mechanical design and energy modeling for an existing dormitory renovation in upstate NY. There is a concrete crawlspace with ground contact that I think could be used to preheat/precool makeup air. I have checked the Bldg-sim archives but have not found any design guides or recommendations for using existing crawlspaces/basements as earth tubes. We'd be cutting through concrete structural walls to build something so I need to do some homework to justify it. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

In what sense?

 

If you mean it doesn't have every single capability of modeling like the
IDF or Text editor would, yes. But nothing does. It's hard to keep up
with the E+ developer cycle ;-)

 

If you mean it doesn't run off Energyplus 3.0. It does.

 

I don't use it because it's too expensive. I prefer OpenStudio and the
IDF Editor/Textpad because you have access to all the capabilities that
E+ has to offer, but it took me years to become even semi comfortable
(read: confident) with modeling through a txt file. 

 

Either way maybe this should be moved over to BLDG-SIM.

Hello;

My feeling is that their currently is not a *perfect* GUI for
EnergyPlus, especially if you're interested in interoperability (ie IFC,
gbXML, etc). Designbuilder seems to be getting closest in this regard,
but when I tested it a while ago I found the modelling interface to be a
bit clumsy and restrictive. OpenStudio is not bad, but still needs a
little work to be practical for every day use (for instance, to my
knowledge there is currently no good way to specify a heat transfer
surface's adjacency conditions). I currently use ECOTECT, which had a
lot of promise when I started using it three years ago but has
progressed exactly zero since then. I don't know much about the other
system you mention.

To summarize: the three you mention will all probably work for you, and
each have their own advantages and disadvantages. If you're specifically
interested in IFC compatibility, I'm not sure about the status of
DesignBuilder in this respect, but neither OpenStudio nor ECOTECT
currently have this capability.

The current version of free sketchup (as of this month I believe) does
not support .dwg importing, actually.  If you continue using any older
version - it shouldn't lose this functionality (keep your installation
files).  The Sketchup development team has been clear on their intent to
continue .dwg and other proprietary format file support in the Pro
version.  

 

**A moment on my soapbox**

 

Our office took this as a cue to recognize that the free version of
Sketchup is explicitly intended for educational/trial purposes, however
powerful it may be - not for professional design use.  Our office
purchased a Pro license in response to ensure continued support of
import/export of .dwg and other formats we use.  I'd encourage others on
bldg-sim to consider this carefully.  The cost:benefit ratio of the free
version of Sketchup, for many of us, is pretty extraordinary.  To top it
off it's actually fairly inexpensive as far as professional design tools
go. 

 

**Stepping off the soapbox**

 

On a Sketchup-related note - I haven't mentioned this on [bldg-sim] yet,
but Sketchup-savvy users using a version with .dwg export support can
actually export their models into AGI32 for photometric and rendering
lighting/daylight studies after a little work in CAD to ensure a clean
import.  I might write up an illustrated guide or post the full scoop
here at some point in the future, but for those interested in learning
immediately I'll just say to head over to the AGI32 forums to find a
lengthy post (intended to troubleshoot other AGI32-specific issues)
where I composed a pretty decent outline of the process to start.

Hello;

My feeling is that their currently is not a *perfect* GUI for
EnergyPlus, especially if you're interested in interoperability (ie IFC,
gbXML, etc). Designbuilder seems to be getting closest in this regard,
but when I tested it a while ago I found the modelling interface to be a
bit clumsy and restrictive. OpenStudio is not bad, but still needs a
little work to be practical for every day use (for instance, to my
knowledge there is currently no good way to specify a heat transfer
surface's adjacency conditions). I currently use ECOTECT, which had a
lot of promise when I started using it three years ago but has
progressed exactly zero since then. I don't know much about the other
system you mention.

To summarize: the three you mention will all probably work for you, and
each have their own advantages and disadvantages. If you're specifically
interested in IFC compatibility, I'm not sure about the status of
DesignBuilder in this respect, but neither OpenStudio nor ECOTECT
currently have this capability.

Hello,

I want to learn EnergyPlus but I need a GUI. As it is a new activity for
me, I would like to find the better couple [E+/GUI] regarding my needs.
I am mainly interested in building energy simulation, particularly on
the topics of energy efficiency and the smart use of solar energy for
solar passive designing. I saw a lot of software on the web : Google
Sketch Up with Openstudio, Designbuilder (well described at Harvard),
Ecotect...

How can I make the best choice? My choice will use the IFC standard. I
saw another software : Digital Project of Gehry Technologies which is
based on Catia (Dassault Systemes) that works with IFC standards, but
has anyone made simulation with [E+/this soft]?

Could you give me advices, please...

Best regards

B.Cavallier

Hi
What is the difference between the prerequisite Energy ant Atmosphere in LEED for Homes Mid-rise and single homes or LEED NC? is the 14% better than code a perquisite and does it have to be above the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 , Appendix G.
Any help is greatly appreciated

Hello; 

My feeling is that their currently is not a *perfect* GUI for EnergyPlus, especially if you're interested in interoperability (ie IFC, gbXML, etc). Designbuilder seems to be getting closest in this regard, but when I tested it a while ago I found the modelling interface to be a bit clumsy and restrictive. OpenStudio is not bad, but still needs a little work to be practical for every day use (for instance, to my knowledge there is currently no good way to specify a heat transfer surface's adjacency conditions). I currently use ECOTECT, which had a lot of promise when I started using it three years ago but has progressed exactly zero since then. I don't know much about the other system you mention. 

To summarize: the three you mention will all probably work for you, and each have their own advantages and disadvantages. If you're specifically interested in IFC compatibility, I'm not sure about the status of DesignBuilder in this respect, but neither OpenStudio nor ECOTECT currently have this capability.

Nick et al,

 

I still think DesignBuilder offers good value for money when you compare it
to the cost of the pro-version of sketch-up.  It imports dxf, pdf, tiff,
bmp, jpg (for 2d extruded modelling) & gbxml (for 3d importing).  Ok,
perhaps it isn't quite as pretty as SketchUp in places, but let's face it,
as building physicists we're generally not interested in architectural
fancifulness.  We are interested in boxes (well more or less) that make the
maths quicker.  DesignBuilder does all that just the same.  It also has the
advantage of the CFD tool module that allows you to look more closely
airflow distribution based on the results from your EnergyPlus simulations
which are directly linked if you want them to be and produces mean age of
air results, that you could use for other ventilation & comfort analysis.

 

Just my tuppence/2 cents worth.

Cheers

Paul

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] [EnergyPlus_Support] I need advices for choosing a
GUI

 

The current version of free sketchup (as of this month I believe) does not
support .dwg importing, actually.  If you continue using any older version -
it shouldn't lose this functionality (keep your installation files).  The
Sketchup development team has been clear on their intent to continue .dwg
and other proprietary format file support in the Pro version.  

 

**A moment on my soapbox**

 

Our office took this as a cue to recognize that the free version of Sketchup
is explicitly intended for educational/trial purposes, however powerful it
may be - not for professional design use.  Our office purchased a Pro
license in response to ensure continued support of import/export of .dwg and
other formats we use.  I'd encourage others on bldg-sim to consider this
carefully.  The cost:benefit ratio of the free version of Sketchup, for many
of us, is pretty extraordinary.  To top it off it's actually fairly
inexpensive as far as professional design tools go. 

 

**Stepping off the soapbox**

 

On a Sketchup-related note - I haven't mentioned this on [bldg-sim] yet, but
Sketchup-savvy users using a version with .dwg export support can actually
export their models into AGI32 for photometric and rendering
lighting/daylight studies after a little work in CAD to ensure a clean
import.  I might write up an illustrated guide or post the full scoop here
at some point in the future, but for those interested in learning
immediately I'll just say to head over to the AGI32 forums to find a lengthy
post (intended to troubleshoot other AGI32-specific issues) where I composed
a pretty decent outline of the process to start.

In what sense?

 

If you mean it doesn't have every single capability of modeling like the IDF
or Text editor would, yes. But nothing does. It's hard to keep up with the
E+ developer cycle ;-)

 

If you mean it doesn't run off Energyplus 3.0. It does.

 

I don't use it because it's too expensive. I prefer OpenStudio and the IDF
Editor/Textpad because you have access to all the capabilities that E+ has
to offer, but it took me years to become even semi comfortable (read:
confident) with modeling through a txt file. 

 

Either way maybe this should be moved over to BLDG-SIM.

Paul et al,

 

Apologies if my comments were misconstrued either as a bash against
Designbuilder or a sales pitch for Sketchup.  My post was and is
intended to clarify Sketchup's current .dwg file support and the related
cost implications.  I personally am in full support of any and all
options/progress/market competition as necessary to advance the science
of building energy modeling.

 

Both Sketchup (in tandem with a variety of plugins and external
software) and Designbuilder are unique and powerful tools that each do a
variety of specific things very well.  

 

"...but let's face it, as building physicists we're generally not
interested in architectural fancifulness.  We are interested in boxes
(well more or less) that make the maths quicker. "

 

To be fair, sometimes the task-at-hand does call for a bit of
"architectural fancifulness," such as when presenting results of
preliminary massing studies to an architect/client!  From my
perspective, Sketchup and Designbuilder both have a definite advantage
over some of the "for-cost" competition in this regard.

 

I'd also like to kindly clarify for any newer subscribers:  you don't
have to be a hardcore physicist with zero aesthetic inclinations to
participate in [bldg-sim] or other onebuilding.org mailing lists!  I've
only been subscribed for a year, but it's apparent that experienced and
inexperienced energy simulation enthusiasts alike are welcome from all
walks of the academic world and design industry.

Nick et al,

 

I still think DesignBuilder offers good value for money when you compare
it to the cost of the pro-version of sketch-up.  It imports dxf, pdf,
tiff, bmp, jpg (for 2d extruded modelling) & gbxml (for 3d importing).
Ok, perhaps it isn't quite as pretty as SketchUp in places, but let's
face it, as building physicists we're generally not interested in
architectural fancifulness.  We are interested in boxes (well more or
less) that make the maths quicker.  DesignBuilder does all that just the
same.  It also has the advantage of the CFD tool module that allows you
to look more closely airflow distribution based on the results from your
EnergyPlus simulations which are directly linked if you want them to be
and produces mean age of air results, that you could use for other
ventilation & comfort analysis.

 

Just my tuppence/2 cents worth.

Cheers

Paul

The current version of free sketchup (as of this month I believe) does
not support .dwg importing, actually.  If you continue using any older
version - it shouldn't lose this functionality (keep your installation
files).  The Sketchup development team has been clear on their intent to
continue .dwg and other proprietary format file support in the Pro
version.  

 

**A moment on my soapbox**

 

Our office took this as a cue to recognize that the free version of
Sketchup is explicitly intended for educational/trial purposes, however
powerful it may be - not for professional design use.  Our office
purchased a Pro license in response to ensure continued support of
import/export of .dwg and other formats we use.  I'd encourage others on
bldg-sim to consider this carefully.  The cost:benefit ratio of the free
version of Sketchup, for many of us, is pretty extraordinary.  To top it
off it's actually fairly inexpensive as far as professional design tools
go. 

 

**Stepping off the soapbox**

 

On a Sketchup-related note - I haven't mentioned this on [bldg-sim] yet,
but Sketchup-savvy users using a version with .dwg export support can
actually export their models into AGI32 for photometric and rendering
lighting/daylight studies after a little work in CAD to ensure a clean
import.  I might write up an illustrated guide or post the full scoop
here at some point in the future, but for those interested in learning
immediately I'll just say to head over to the AGI32 forums to find a
lengthy post (intended to troubleshoot other AGI32-specific issues)
where I composed a pretty decent outline of the process to start.

In what sense?

 

If you mean it doesn't have every single capability of modeling like the
IDF or Text editor would, yes. But nothing does. It's hard to keep up
with the E+ developer cycle ;-)

 

If you mean it doesn't run off Energyplus 3.0. It does.

 

I don't use it because it's too expensive. I prefer OpenStudio and the
IDF Editor/Textpad because you have access to all the capabilities that
E+ has to offer, but it took me years to become even semi comfortable
(read: confident) with modeling through a txt file. 

 

Either way maybe this should be moved over to BLDG-SIM.

Hello;

My feeling is that their currently is not a *perfect* GUI for
EnergyPlus, especially if you're interested in interoperability (ie IFC,
gbXML, etc). Designbuilder seems to be getting closest in this regard,
but when I tested it a while ago I found the modelling interface to be a
bit clumsy and restrictive. OpenStudio is not bad, but still needs a
little work to be practical for every day use (for instance, to my
knowledge there is currently no good way to specify a heat transfer
surface's adjacency conditions). I currently use ECOTECT, which had a
lot of promise when I started using it three years ago but has
progressed exactly zero since then. I don't know much about the other
system you mention.

To summarize: the three you mention will all probably work for you, and
each have their own advantages and disadvantages. If you're specifically
interested in IFC compatibility, I'm not sure about the status of
DesignBuilder in this respect, but neither OpenStudio nor ECOTECT
currently have this capability.

Hello,

I want to learn EnergyPlus but I need a GUI. As it is a new activity for
me, I would like to find the better couple [E+/GUI] regarding my needs.
I am mainly interested in building energy simulation, particularly on
the topics of energy efficiency and the smart use of solar energy for
solar passive designing. I saw a lot of software on the web : Google
Sketch Up with Openstudio, Designbuilder (well described at Harvard),
Ecotect...

How can I make the best choice? My choice will use the IFC standard. I
saw another software : Digital Project of Gehry Technologies which is
based on Catia (Dassault Systemes) that works with IFC standards, but
has anyone made simulation with [E+/this soft]?

Could you give me advices, please...

Subject: [Bldg-sim] South Africa's approach to building energy efficiency
Message-ID: <6DE4EB7029BD41FD97D0B1AC54184057@MBABIG01>

You have all seen requests for help from individual users.  

 

Here is a request from a small country !

 

South Africa is busy trying to set up its building energy efficiency code.
SA is considering making simulation mandatory for ALL commercial buildings
above 500 m sq.  

 

If this becomes mandatory I fear that the simulations will in general be of
low quality, leading to simulation eventually being discredited. This
country has very little weather data, almost no materials data, and very few
trained Building Physicists. 

 

Can IBPSA Members offer any advice ?   

 

There is evidence that building simulation can play an important part in
design, but is there any evidence that it works in regulating energy as part
of building code compliance ?   

 

   Thanks,

       Mike Barker

Nick,

 

Sorry if I gave the impression I'm not interested in or appreciate
aesthetics.  I actually see my role as marrying architecture and engineering
so I need to understand both.  I was just trying to think about the maths
side of it.  Many times I have received a sketchup model from an architect
and it is nigh-on impossible to use for modelling and simulation use as it's
just too fancy (for want of a better phrase).

 

I agree everyone welcome here.  I was just making some comments too.

 

Cheers

Paul

in [bldg-sim] or other onebuilding.org mailing lists!  I've only been
subscribed for a year, but it's apparent that experienced and inexperienced
energy simulation enthusiasts alike are welcome from all walks of the
academic world and design industry.

Nick et al,

 

I still think DesignBuilder offers good value for money when you compare it
to the cost of the pro-version of sketch-up.  It imports dxf, pdf, tiff,
bmp, jpg (for 2d extruded modelling) & gbxml (for 3d importing).  Ok,
perhaps it isn't quite as pretty as SketchUp in places, but let's face it,
as building physicists we're generally not interested in architectural
fancifulness.  We are interested in boxes (well more or less) that make the
maths quicker.  DesignBuilder does all that just the same.  It also has the
advantage of the CFD tool module that allows you to look more closely
airflow distribution based on the results from your EnergyPlus simulations
which are directly linked if you want them to be and produces mean age of
air results, that you could use for other ventilation & comfort analysis.

 

Just my tuppence/2 cents worth.

Cheers

Paul

The current version of free sketchup (as of this month I believe) does not
support .dwg importing, actually.  If you continue using any older version -
it shouldn't lose this functionality (keep your installation files).  The
Sketchup development team has been clear on their intent to continue .dwg
and other proprietary format file support in the Pro version.  

 

**A moment on my soapbox**

 

Our office took this as a cue to recognize that the free version of Sketchup
is explicitly intended for educational/trial purposes, however powerful it
may be - not for professional design use.  Our office purchased a Pro
license in response to ensure continued support of import/export of .dwg and
other formats we use.  I'd encourage others on bldg-sim to consider this
carefully.  The cost:benefit ratio of the free version of Sketchup, for many
of us, is pretty extraordinary.  To top it off it's actually fairly
inexpensive as far as professional design tools go. 

 

**Stepping off the soapbox**

 

On a Sketchup-related note - I haven't mentioned this on [bldg-sim] yet, but
Sketchup-savvy users using a version with .dwg export support can actually
export their models into AGI32 for photometric and rendering
lighting/daylight studies after a little work in CAD to ensure a clean
import.  I might write up an illustrated guide or post the full scoop here
at some point in the future, but for those interested in learning
immediately I'll just say to head over to the AGI32 forums to find a lengthy
post (intended to troubleshoot other AGI32-specific issues) where I composed
a pretty decent outline of the process to start.

In what sense?

 

If you mean it doesn't have every single capability of modeling like the IDF
or Text editor would, yes. But nothing does. It's hard to keep up with the
E+ developer cycle ;-)

 

If you mean it doesn't run off Energyplus 3.0. It does.

 

I don't use it because it's too expensive. I prefer OpenStudio and the IDF
Editor/Textpad because you have access to all the capabilities that E+ has
to offer, but it took me years to become even semi comfortable (read:
confident) with modeling through a txt file. 

 

Either way maybe this should be moved over to BLDG-SIM.

Hello;

My feeling is that their currently is not a *perfect* GUI for EnergyPlus,
especially if you're interested in interoperability (ie IFC, gbXML, etc).
Designbuilder seems to be getting closest in this regard, but when I tested
it a while ago I found the modelling interface to be a bit clumsy and
restrictive. OpenStudio is not bad, but still needs a little work to be
practical for every day use (for instance, to my knowledge there is
currently no good way to specify a heat transfer surface's adjacency
conditions). I currently use ECOTECT, which had a lot of promise when I
started using it three years ago but has progressed exactly zero since then.
I don't know much about the other system you mention.

To summarize: the three you mention will all probably work for you, and each
have their own advantages and disadvantages. If you're specifically
interested in IFC compatibility, I'm not sure about the status of
DesignBuilder in this respect, but neither OpenStudio nor ECOTECT currently
have this capability.

Hello,

I want to learn EnergyPlus but I need a GUI. As it is a new activity for me,
I would like to find the better couple [E+/GUI] regarding my needs. I am
mainly interested in building energy simulation, particularly on the topics
of energy efficiency and the smart use of solar energy for solar passive
designing. I saw a lot of software on the web : Google Sketch Up with
Openstudio, Designbuilder (well described at Harvard), Ecotect...

How can I make the best choice? My choice will use the IFC standard. I saw
another software : Digital Project of Gehry Technologies which is based on
Catia (Dassault Systemes) that works with IFC standards, but has anyone made
simulation with [E+/this soft]?

Could you give me advices, please...

Most energy codes have to routes to ensure energy efficiency; building simulation and design guidelines or minimum requirements or wall and roof  insulation, etc. I would suggest following this route.

You have all seen requests for help from individual users.   

  

Here is a request from a small country ! 

  

South Africa is busy trying to set up its building energy efficiency code. SA is considering making simulation mandatory for ALL commercial buildings above 500 m sq.   

  

If this becomes mandatory I fear that the simulations will in general be of low quality, leading to simulation eventually being discredited. This country has very little weather data, almost no materials data, and very few trained Building Physicists. 

  

Can IBPSA Members offer any advice ?    

  

There is evidence that building simulation can play an important part in design, but is there any evidence that it works in regulating energy as part of building code compliance ?   

  

   Thanks,

Could you give me advices, please...

Message-ID: <4AEABB5402000098000295D7@codex.archenergy.com>

Kristin Shewfelt in our office has been working with the USGBC on the
mid-Rise and Homes LEED versions. Her response to the posting is below.

>>> Kristin Shewfelt 10/30/2009 9:56 AM >>>
Hi Ellen - 
 
The energy prerequisite for mid-rise buildings (EA Credit 1.1: Minimum
Energy Performance for Mid-Rise) is a 15% improvement in the proposed
building performance rating per ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004.  THE EPA MF
Building Performance Simulation Guidelines must be followed. 
 
For single-family homes, the energy performance credit (EA Credit 1.1)
is tied to the U.S. EPA ENERGY STAR requirements, meaning a 15%
improvement vis-a-vis IRC 2004. 
 
Please let me know if this is sufficient. 
 
Thanks.

Hi
What is the difference between the prerequisite Energy ant Atmosphere
in LEED for Homes Mid-rise and single homes or LEED NC? is the 14%
better than code a perquisite and does it have to be above the ASHRAE
90.1-2004 , Appendix G.
Any help is greatly appreciated

In what sense? 

  

If you mean it doesn?t have every single capability of modeling like
the IDF or Text editor would, yes. But nothing does. It?s hard to keep
up with the E+ developer cycle ;-) 

  

If you mean it doesn?t run off Energyplus 3.0. It does. 

  

I don?t use it because it?s too expensive. I prefer OpenStudio and the
IDF Editor/Textpad because you have access to all the capabilities that
E+ has to offer, but it took me years to become even semi comfortable
(read: confident) with modeling through a txt file. 

  

Either way maybe this should be moved over to BLDG-SIM.

Hello; 

My feeling is that their currently is not a *perfect* GUI for
EnergyPlus, especially if you're interested in interoperability (ie IFC,
gbXML, etc). Designbuilder seems to be getting closest in this regard,
but when I tested it a while ago I found the modelling interface to be a
bit clumsy and restrictive. OpenStudio is not bad, but still needs a
little work to be practical for every day use (for instance, to my
knowledge there is currently no good way to specify a heat transfer
surface's adjacency conditions). I currently use ECOTECT, which had a
lot of promise when I started using it three years ago but has
progressed exactly zero since then. I don't know much about the other
system you mention. 

To summarize: the three you mention will all probably work for you, and
each have their own advantages and disadvantages. If you're specifically
interested in IFC compatibility, I'm not sure about the status of
DesignBuilder in this respect, but neither OpenStudio nor ECOTECT
currently have this capability.

I would like to attend a training session on eQuest somewhere near San
Francisco or at least on the West Coast. I have looked at the Doe-2
website and it states that the last session this year is in Toronto.

 

If anyone knows of any other training session could you please respond.
Thank you

I have over R-58 in the attic with the first layer R-19 so it is short 
cut - only 22 1/2 inches wide
to allow for the wood nominal 2 inch trusses. In the US fiberglass batts 
R-25 and up are full cut -
a full 24 inches or 16 inches wide for application above the framing.

I put Arches of R-25 foil faced over the return air duct with the foil 
facing out and the running direction
of the batt is across the duct and the edges are taped with heavy duck 
tape. It works very well.

I am developing detailed records of the utility bills and heating / 
cooling degree days. These records
go back to January 1987. I am very near the Sterling Virginia USA 
weather station so I can get
daily and hourly data and also RADAR data going back to 1991.......

I do not recommend putting the return ducts in the attic anymore.  I 
have developed a much better
approach, I just can't seem to get funding support to build a demo.

For multi-zone buildings, the limit should be on the sum of "non-concident" unmet load hours for each zone. For standard energy modeling output reports, you can determine the total annual unmet hours for each zone, but you don't know which hours of the year they occur.

Or better yet, what if you had 300 zones with 30 hours of unmet loads (all at the same hours)? By the 90.1 reasoning, you would have 9000 unmet load hours (greater than the number of hours in a year!).

It seems like we're stuck with what we have until the energy modeling programs can produce an output report that describes the sum of non-coincident unmet load hours.
