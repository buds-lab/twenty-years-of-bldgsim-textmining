Message-ID: <005301ccc919$e564dde0$b02e99a0$@com>

Hello,

 

Wish you all a very happy and prosperous new year.

 

I want to know the effect of radiant floor cooling system on room air
stratification layer. So, is it possible to know the air temperature at 1ft,
3 ft and 6 ft above the floor in my conditioned zone. I think it is not
possible using output variables, but can we put air temperature sensor at
desired location and monitor the results in EnergyPlus. Kindly reply asap.

 

Thanks,

 

With regards,

Dear Mr. Sharma,

 

You are correct that there are no outputs specific to the radiant loop
objects or the "InternalSource" constructions that will give you a surface
temperature. However, you should be able to grab any surface's temperature
with:

 

Output:Variable,

                SURFACE NAME,

                Surface Inside Temperature,

                Daily OR Hourly;

Greetings.

0.6 ACH at 50 Pa seems like the targetted maximum, though some passive houses have reportedly reached as low as 0.35 ACH.

To convert those values to normal pressure (something like 12 Pa / 0.05 in. w.c.) I divide by 20.

Hi Leen,

I typically use the formula:  ach (normal pressure) = ACH at 50Pa/20, based on Kronvall and Persily - this is known as the KP model. 

A more detailed model for converting ACH at 50 can be found in Sherman 1987:

Estimation of Infiltration from Leakage and Climate Indicators
Energy and Buildings, 10 (1987) 81 - 86

If your modelling a passive house it may be worth using a more sophisticated model than the KP model. You can also look in the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference manual, it discusses some methods developed by DOE etc for IBlast and DOE-2 to modify the actual infiltration rate for wind and other factors on an hourly basis according to the weather file.

Regards,
Hayes

Dear?Group,

I have modeled an office building which is heated by boiler, however I would like to model the boiler with heat recovery for energy efficiency. I have investigated example files of energyplus but I couldn't find any examples for this type of boiler. Therefore I would like to learn if it's possible to model a boiler with heat recovery?

Dinner meeting registration fee is $40, including family style Greek meal
from Chicago?s famous Parthenon Restaurant, originator of flaming saganaki.
Opa!

Cash bar is available during dinner as well.

We are working on an on-line advance registration option and will follow-up
with that shortly for those who wish to pay with credit cards. In the
meantime please RSVP to me by January 13th so that I can update the count
with the restaurant.

*Better Building Controls Through Simulation*



Simulation serves many roles in the building industry.  For many building
professionals, simulation tools (e.g., EnergyPlus, DOE-2) are a means of
comparing the energy performance of alternative envelope and HVAC system
designs.  For individuals concerned with the development of control
algorithms, these same tools are often inadequate because they lack dynamic
system models that are necessary to properly design the algorithms.  This
talk will present a number of use cases involving simulation tools and
their application to the development of building control algorithms.  The
talk will also touch on tools that can be used to streamline the process of
testing a ?simulation-proven? algorithm in a laboratory or field
environment.



*Bio:  *John House is a Principal Research Engineer at Johnson Controls
Canada, where he conducts research on control algorithms and fault
detection methods to improve the energy efficiency of heating, ventilating
and air-conditioning systems in buildings.  Prior to joining Johnson
Controls, he was employed first at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology and later at the Iowa Energy Center.  John has a Ph.D. in
mechanical engineering from the University of Iowa.

The Parthenon has complimentary valet parking, and is relatively close to
the UIC-Halsted stop of the CTA?s Blue Line public transportation ($2.25
each way) ? take the Halsted street exit and not the Morgan Street exit at
the station. In warmer weather the 1.2 mile walk might be pleasant from the
Palmer House (allow 25 minutes ? take a left on Monroe and a left on
Halsted) ? taxi cabs will be plentiful at the hotel and at the restaurant
and might run about $5 each way.

Please contact me with any questions related to the meeting. Feel free to
come for the business meeting without an RSVP for dinner.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Calibrated Simulations & ASHRAE G14
Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP422CFD5BA4BB9AF1C70B8DBBD970@phx.gbl>

Hi,
Does anyone have experience with calibrated simulations? Especially, in accordance with ASHRAE guideline 14, or other standards / guidelines.

I've been working on a calibrating and EnergyPlus model to measured gas HVAC data for a single family house with extensive monitoring and detailed information available and I am finding it very difficult to achieve the <= 30% CV RSME that Guideline 14 suggests.

I'm surprised that it is this challenging because I have far more information available than what would likely be available in typical modelling jobs. Eg. ACH rating, measured ground temperature data, full as-built plans, indoor temperature measurements....

So I'm curious to hear about anyone else's experiences with this. Is this guideline generally achievable for modellers? 

Thanks,

as far as i'm aware if an item is not covered in the nrel guidelines

Hello Hayes,

I helped write the calibrated simulation section of Guideline 14, including the new Guideline 14, which is about to go out for public review. I also participated in the NEMVP, IPMVP. 

Currently, the Guideline 14 committee is completing the final draft and will meet at the Chicago ASHRAE meeting for final discussion before it goes out (Dennis Landsberg is the committee chair, and I've cc'd others to chime in). So, if you wait for a little bit, you'll be able to get the public review draft of the new Guideline 14, which contains lots of new, good stuff.

You'll also find useful material in the IPMVP (latest version), the ASHRAE Performance Metric Protocols, and the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, Chapter 19, 2009. Dr. Reddy also now has a great text book on statistical or inverse methods for engineers.

In addition, here are some of papers that our Lab has published that address the issue of calibrated simulation. You'll find most of these on-line at our web site:

I also teach calibrated simulation to the students that take my graduate simulation class. In a nutshell, you can do so by using the following simple rules-of-thumb (these are based on Norford/Hseih's work in N.J.):

1. Force the electrical loads to equal whatever data you have, i.e., hourly is best, or use daily or monthly (i.e., see the new ASHRAE Research Project by Abshakra and Reddy for more on this). Force the occupancy and internal loads as well. Shut off infiltration if there is an AHU.

2. Use real weather data (i.e., roll you own weather file), or use the closest TMY or TMY2 or TMY3 files (but do not match the temporal data).

3. Get the average hourly weekday/weekend electrical profiles to match.

4. Use daily heating and cooling from the appropriate hourly report vs real daily data plotted against average daily temperatures. Turn everything on in the simulation (i.e., do not use occupied unoccupied schedules unless you're really sure of this).

5. Look at the results (graphical) and take a good guess at what to tweek, repeat 1 - 4 as needed. 

6. Spend a little time as needed to get the envelope described. Use a simple structure since systems and plant will change answers by +-100 - 500%, versus architectural features that change things by only 20 - 50%.

7. Ask for help.

Finally, follow the +- differences in Guideline 14 or the IPMVP and don't forget that your building could be messed up, which means that your simulation will needed to be messed up to match it.

We're currently working on automated calibrated methods for residential, with some thoughts about the same for commercial. Others have similar tools as well (i.e., see the ASHRAE literature for these).

Hope this helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Calibrated Simulations & ASHRAE G14

Hi,
Does anyone have experience with calibrated simulations? Especially, in accordance with ASHRAE guideline 14, or other standards / guidelines.

I've been working on a calibrating and EnergyPlus model to measured gas HVAC data for a single family house with extensive monitoring and detailed information available and I am finding it very difficult to achieve the <= 30% CV RSME that Guideline 14 suggests.

I'm surprised that it is this challenging because I have far more information available than what would likely be available in typical modelling jobs. Eg. ACH rating, measured ground temperature data, full as-built plans, indoor temperature measurements....

So I'm curious to hear about anyone else's experiences with this. Is this guideline generally achievable for modellers?

Thanks,

Hayes --
When calibrating residential models, I find that tweaking things like shade
schedules, internal mass, and solar mass coupling is quite helpful. You
also need to implement some natural ventilation if that's happening. Also,
you should always distrust your measurements until you have a better feel
for what the error bound is like. How did you measure ACH? With a blower
door? You'll be lucky to have the infiltration component right to within
30%. Do your wall constructions compensate for two dimensional heat
transfer effects? How well do you think you have these quantified? What
about your ducts? And your air conditioning equipment? Don't overconstrain
yourself.

Remember also that you are using a simulation model, not actually solving
the complete set of heat transfer equations. The model is just a model --
it won't calculate the correct total energy consumption unless
you calibrate it to do so. Remember that different simulation software
modeling the same highly simplified building test cases vary by 10-20% or
more (see BESTEST results comparing ESP-R, EnergyPlus and various DOE2
generations). Simulation models work great for showing relative differences
in energy consumption, not so much for absolute energy consumption.

My general approach for residential building calibration looks something
like this:

   1. Build out your model using your best available data.
   2. Nail the lighting and equipment loads.
   3. Nail the hot water loads.
   4. Compare your annual and monthly heating and cooling consumption to
   measured and look at the direction each need to move, then start making
   tweaks to your model. I try to turn all of knobs that have similar impacts,
   and keep them all in what looks like a reasonable range.
   5. Take a look at the hourly profiles for different seasons and look at
   interactions of solar, mass, and natural ventilation. You can tweak these
   to shift your shape some.
   6. Last, I do what feels like the big cheat, which is to start messing
   with the daily and monthly thermostat schedules to get things fine-tuned. I
   can generally keep things within a degree or two of measured temps. This
   step will almost certainly be necessary to get your results lined up.

In the end, I think it's fairly difficult to get a residential model
calibrated to the hourly CV(RMSE) of 30% for the HVAC end uses, even for an
experienced residential modeler. If your target is based on total
consumption, then you should not have a problem if the non-HVAC loads are
smooth enough. I don't know for sure, but it appears Guideline 14
simulation guidance was not developed with calibrating to a single
residential single family home in mind. It's not something people really
do. We calibrate to models of aggregations of homes when we're evaluating
residential energy efficiency programs for utilities.

I'd be very curious to hear about other calibration methods/standards used
by experts in the field. Prof. Haberl's response was great.

Justin,

Interesting comments on calibration, especially for residential. I'm afraid my previous comments were slanted towards commercial/institutional buildings in cooling dominated climates. Hence, I did not mention DHW, nor some of the finer details that you suggested.

We've been developing a method that follows the BESTEST EX protocols, and a statistical database of building characteristics, to construct a first "blind" pass of a home, knowing only the square footage, zip code and year built, we assume all the rest of the characteristics for the house from the database and usually get close to the actual heating/cooling energy use (surprise) of the house. Early work on this can be found in the MS thesis by Piljae Im. Our current work is similar to what Prof. Kissock is doing at U. Dayton for his model-driven, residential audits.

Hello Hayes,

I helped write the calibrated simulation section of Guideline 14, including the new Guideline 14, which is about to go out for public review. I also participated in the NEMVP, IPMVP.

Currently, the Guideline 14 committee is completing the final draft and will meet at the Chicago ASHRAE meeting for final discussion before it goes out (Dennis Landsberg is the committee chair, and I've cc'd others to chime in). So, if you wait for a little bit, you'll be able to get the public review draft of the new Guideline 14, which contains lots of new, good stuff.

You'll also find useful material in the IPMVP (latest version), the ASHRAE Performance Metric Protocols, and the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, Chapter 19, 2009. Dr. Reddy also now has a great text book on statistical or inverse methods for engineers.

In addition, here are some of papers that our Lab has published that address the issue of calibrated simulation. You'll find most of these on-line at our web site:

I also teach calibrated simulation to the students that take my graduate simulation class. In a nutshell, you can do so by using the following simple rules-of-thumb (these are based on Norford/Hseih's work in N.J.):

1. Force the electrical loads to equal whatever data you have, i.e., hourly is best, or use daily or monthly (i.e., see the new ASHRAE Research Project by Abshakra and Reddy for more on this). Force the occupancy and internal loads as well. Shut off infiltration if there is an AHU.

2. Use real weather data (i.e., roll you own weather file), or use the closest TMY or TMY2 or TMY3 files (but do not match the temporal data).

3. Get the average hourly weekday/weekend electrical profiles to match.

4. Use daily heating and cooling from the appropriate hourly report vs real daily data plotted against average daily temperatures. Turn everything on in the simulation (i.e., do not use occupied unoccupied schedules unless you're really sure of this).

5. Look at the results (graphical) and take a good guess at what to tweek, repeat 1 - 4 as needed.

6. Spend a little time as needed to get the envelope described. Use a simple structure since systems and plant will change answers by +-100 - 500%, versus architectural features that change things by only 20 - 50%.

7. Ask for help.

Finally, follow the +- differences in Guideline 14 or the IPMVP and don't forget that your building could be messed up, which means that your simulation will needed to be messed up to match it.

We're currently working on automated calibrated methods for residential, with some thoughts about the same for commercial. Others have similar tools as well (i.e., see the ASHRAE literature for these).

Hope this helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Calibrated Simulations & ASHRAE G14

Hi,
Does anyone have experience with calibrated simulations? Especially, in accordance with ASHRAE guideline 14, or other standards / guidelines.

I've been working on a calibrating and EnergyPlus model to measured gas HVAC data for a single family house with extensive monitoring and detailed information available and I am finding it very difficult to achieve the <= 30% CV RSME that Guideline 14 suggests.

I'm surprised that it is this challenging because I have far more information available than what would likely be available in typical modelling jobs. Eg. ACH rating, measured ground temperature data, full as-built plans, indoor temperature measurements....

So I'm curious to hear about anyone else's experiences with this. Is this guideline generally achievable for modellers?

Thanks,

   RE: [Bldg-sim] Calibrated Simulations & ASHRAE G14

There are probably occupancy variations that took place in the house that
cause variance in the energy usage for the measured case, and it may be
difficult for you to capture those effects in the model.

Other building occupancies (commercial, institutional, etc.) stick more
closely to their typical usage patterns and the benchmark CV should be
achievable in most cases.

It should be for residential also if you have enough data about the usage
to tailor the operating schedules.

You might want to start out with a gas usage and HDD regression to identify
if there are any months that jump out as atypical from your modeling,
irregular usage periods, etc.

DHW could be significant also, maybe you can get water usage data for the
house to see if there were periods when occpuants were using more
showers/sinks/laundry/etc.

One other idea might be to see how sensitive the CV is to the measured ACH,
which could vary during times of the year, not sure if your measurement
covered multiple data points (summer/winter/occpupied/unoccupied).

Hope this helps!

David

I believe that if you move the file so that the total file path does not exceed 260 characters, that this will go away.  I have run into this issue in the past as well and that fixed it for me.

I wanted to follow-up with everyone ? we now have an option for you to
pre-pay for the IBPSA-USA dinner with a major credit card through
Eventbrite.



http://ibpsausadinner.eventbrite.com/



A few advantages for the organization:



1.       Simplifies the registration process ? we?ve had some delay in the
past for starting the dinner program due to the volume of transactions
taking place as our meetings have grown in size. Use of the on-line system
will help IBPSA-USA streamline the registration portion of the evening,
particularly if you are arriving right at the start of dinner.

2.       Print your own receipt! If applicable, submit your reimbursement
right away.



3.       Feel free to register this way even if you?ve already submitted an
RSVP. I understand there may be some need for flexibility, and several
people have indicated they will stick with cash at the door which is fine.



As we often have to provide some minimum count to the restaurant
(particularly as our meeting sizes increase) this will help us in better
managing our events, as well as reducing the time to issue receipts to cash
attendees.



Cash at the door (both RSVP?ed and some number of walk-in) will still be
available. It would be helpful to arrive earlier during the social hour if
paying using cash so that we have time to make the registration, issue a
receipt, etc.



Please let me know of any questions, and with any special dietary requests
beyond vegetarian.



Thanks!

*Better Building Controls Through Simulation*



Simulation serves many roles in the building industry.  For many building
professionals, simulation tools (e.g., EnergyPlus, DOE-2) are a means of
comparing the energy performance of alternative envelope and HVAC system
designs.  For individuals concerned with the development of control
algorithms, these same tools are often inadequate because they lack dynamic
system models that are necessary to properly design the algorithms.  This
talk will present a number of use cases involving simulation tools and
their application to the development of building control algorithms.  The
talk will also touch on tools that can be used to streamline the process of
testing a ?simulation-proven? algorithm in a laboratory or field
environment.



*Bio:  *John House is a Principal Research Engineer at Johnson Controls
Canada, where he conducts research on control algorithms and fault
detection methods to improve the energy efficiency of heating, ventilating
and air-conditioning systems in buildings.  Prior to joining Johnson
Controls, he was employed first at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology and later at the Iowa Energy Center.  John has a Ph.D. in
mechanical engineering from the University of Iowa.

The Parthenon has complimentary valet parking, and is relatively close to
the UIC-Halsted stop of the CTA?s Blue Line public transportation ($2.25
each way) ? take the Halsted street exit and not the Morgan Street exit at
the station. In warmer weather the 1.2 mile walk might be pleasant from the
Palmer House (allow 25 minutes ? take a left on Monroe and a left on
Halsted) ? taxi cabs will be plentiful at the hotel and at the restaurant
and might run about $5 each way.

Please contact me with any questions related to the meeting. Feel free to
come for the business meeting without an RSVP for dinner.

Hi Justin,

Great response - thanks! I think you brought up a few very important points that I may not have given enough consideration to. Such as the infiltration model, I am using a blower door test ACH rating @50Pa, then converting to regular pressure by dividing by 20 (KP model). Then in EnergyPlus I am using the coefficients from DOE-2 (only a windspeed coefficient) - maybe this is unrealistic as this model would have no infiltration when windspeed = 0.

I also assumed ACH of the attic = 10 at 50 .. not sure if this is realistic, and not sure if its significant. And I have no air exchange between the basement zone and the main zone. I did not account for 2d heat transfer effects, but did compute the overall thermal resistances taking all framing members into account (1/Rt = 1/R1 + 1/R2). Do you think that doing a THERM analysis would increase the accuracy significantly?

What do you mean by solar mass coupling?

I am only calibrating the gas consumption, and the home is a research facility with simulated occupancy (appliances and lights that turn on and off according to a computer program). So it is a "best case" modelling scenario, where I know a lot more about the house than what would typically be known or available.

Interesting point abou the BESTEST results. From that I wonder what accuracy I can assume EnergyPlus has?

Thanks for your help,
Hayes

You also need to implement some natural ventilation if that's happening. Also, you should always distrust your measurements until you have a better feel for what the error bound is like. How did you measure ACH? With a blower door? You'll be lucky to have the infiltration component right to within 30%. Do your wall constructions compensate for two dimensional heat transfer effects? How well do you think you have these quantified? What about your ducts? And your air conditioning equipment? Don't overconstrain yourself.

The model is just a model -- it won't calculate the correct total energy consumption unless you calibrate it to do so. Remember that different simulation software modeling the same highly simplified building test cases vary by 10-20% or more (see BESTEST results comparing ESP-R, EnergyPlus and various DOE2 generations). Simulation models work great for showing relative differences in energy consumption, not so much for absolute energy consumption.

If your target is based on total consumption, then you should not have a problem if the non-HVAC loads are smooth enough. I don't know for sure, but it appears Guideline 14 simulation guidance was not developed with calibrating to a single residential single family home in mind. It's not something people really do. We calibrate to models of aggregations of homes when we're evaluating residential energy efficiency programs for utilities.

	baseline design
Message-ID: <CA+UDFY=HJj7BjmCDA2GbreKcV8+RG-sAmQPR4EQugpv__6iyMA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I model a residential building with dwelling units and a multipurpose
space (92000 ft2) . It has a schedule  24/7 hour of operation. Proposed
design has 2 DOAS unit with 2 AHUs and fan powered boxes. Each unit has
it's own FPB.  The baseline design is PTAC.  My proposed design has Forward
curved with VFD Main, return, optional, and exhaust fans. Fan power VAV
fans are used as secondary fans. My Baseline design has FC with VFD
return, optional, exhaust fans. Main fan is constant volume FC fan.  I use
90.1-2004 standard for the energy model.
My question is if I have to include FPB from the proposed design for energy
calculations in the baseline design or I have to exclude them from the
proposed design. May be I am doing right and I have to count them in the
proposed design only.
Now my fan power is much higher in the proposed design than in the baseline
design
Please, advise.

Thank you,

*Genia Gorbachinsky

Subject: [Bldg-sim] BPI-2400-S-2011 (formerly BPI-107) Standardized
 Qualification of Whole House Energy Savings Estimate
Message-ID: <6692B6E504A5054682FDE225163A6E6F0EBAB1AE@mbx027-e1-nj-10.exch027.domain.local>

All:

I'm writing this post to share with you something you might find both interesting and pertinent to our growing industry. As many of you are aware, qualified energy simulation software is increasingly being applied to buildings for retrofit analysis purposes, and savings predictions generated from simulation software are in many cases being linked to the awarding of financial incentives by outside stakeholders.

Recently BPI (Building Performance Institute) published a standard related to energy simulation which you may be interested in reading: BPI-2400-S-2011 (formerly BPI-107) "Standardized Qualification of Whole House Energy Savings Estimate".  Electronic versions of the standard can be found here: http://bpi.pnl.gov/forumdisplay.php/16-BPI-2400-S-2011-%28formerly-BPI-107%29-Standardized-Qualification-of-Whole-House-Energy-Savings-Estimate.

The standard covers RESIDENTIAL buildings of 4 units or less, and was developed to support the introduction of RESIDENTIAL energy performance based legislation having bi-partisan support. This legislation, titled "Cut Energy Bills at Home Act" was sponsored by Senators Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Diane Feinstein (D-CA) and was introduced into the US Senate in late 2011.  It is often referred to as the "25e" bill.  More information on the 25e bill can be found here: http://www.efficiencyfirst.org/static/files/25EFactSheet.pdf

One important thing to understand is that 25e would not have been introduced without the publishing of BPI-2400-S-2011.  The proposed 25e legislation, while providing RESIDENTIAL building owners similar tax benefits to COMMERCIAL focused IRS 179D existing legislation, differs in many key ways:


a)      25e provides tax credits to building owners, while 179D provides tax deductions to building owners

b)      25e (through referencing BPI-2400-S-2011) provides a procedure for determining standardized estimates of energy savings for existing buildings. This procedure includes elements which account for both the quality of pre-retrofit actual energy bills and standardized operating conditions used for generating standardized savings estimates related to thresholds defined by 25e.

c)       25e (through referencing BPI-2400-S-2011) provides acceptance criteria for error between simulation predicted values and weather normalized end-use energy during the baseline period.

d)      25e (through referencing BPI-2400-S-2011) provides different compliance pathways related to the different levels of data quality of pre-retrofit actual energy bills of an existing building.

After I read the BPI-2400 standard carefully, I interpret it as including an attempt to define a calibration standard for applying qualified energy simulation tools to existing RESIDENTIAL buildings. Interesting!  I began to see the potential benefits related to wide-scale adoption, and could not help thinking about how it might somehow be adapted to be applicable to appropriate commercial buildings.  While acknowledging that calibrated modeling of larger, more complex existing commercial buildings (mixed use office towers, buildings with both process and comfort loads, etc.) should demand a more rigorous approach, I believe a large number of existing commercial buildings such as smaller, stand-alone office/retail/ service buildings could be cost effectively modeled to represent their existing performance using qualified whole building energy simulation tools.  I believe a performance based procedure aimed at these buildings (including qualified energy modeling tools as the core technology) could be a market motivator for driving deep performance improvements. This is because when we start talking about deep retrofits to existing buildings (i.e. projects estimated to save 30,40,50+ % of energy usage) I believe energy simulation tools (even with their shortcomings) represent the best available technology for cost effectively and realistically quantifying the significant interactive effects of multiple ECMs which influence multiple end-uses.

It would seem to me, some adaptation of BPI-2400 to fit another building stock would be useful. For example, with some careful inclusion of COMNET defaults for Input Constraints, and some revision of the Utility Bill criteria to incorporate handling multiple meters of the same fuel, we could have something that, though arguably not perfect, would be 'good enough' to encourage dialogue with stakeholders outside of our community such as IOU and other policy influencers.  If we are able to by consensus craft a vehicle for linking potential incentive awards to actual pre-retrofit performance of commercial buildings along with quality assurance procedures (M&V) for evaluating post retrofit performance as exhibited by utility bill history (considered the truth standard of performance), I think we really have something. I want to start thinking about what an ASHRAE standard representing this might look like.

Regardless of whether 25e passes through Congress and is eventually enacted, it seems to me the purpose and intent of the BPI-2400 standard is now positioned to be referenced by other, more agile institutions, and can and will be applied - and improved over time.  A quality reference standard becomes a very valuable chess piece which can be played over and over again, and I think if carefully crafted,  it will increase the market value and acceptance of energy modeling tools.

Anyways - I'm curious to how others on this listserve who engage in the COMMERCIAL building segments react to what is unfolding in the RESIDENTIAL community. While there is certainly a great deal to  learn - can you also see any opportunities?  One strength of our community is its diversity, and I want to leverage this.  I suspect this listserve includes representation from practitioners, academia, researchers, equipment manufacturers, policy analysts, students, and many other interests - bonded together by a common goal to increase the responsible use of building energy simulation tools in the world we live in.

Next move(s)?

All the Best,

_Chris

Ece,

What you are looking for is the WaterHeater:Mixed object. This boiler has
four ports, one source side inlet and source side outlet for a heat
recovery loop or solar hot water heating loop, and one use side inlet and
outlet for the demand loop. There is also a heating coil of either natural
gas or electric type in order to meet the heating demand when the source
side heat transfer is inadequate to serve the load.

Hope this helps.

Chris,

Very interesting information.
I'm wondering, if you can give a rough estimate of the money flow into
building energy efficiency market that 25e, if enacted,  can generate?
How it is comparing with other government programs like WAP SEP, EECBG,
LIHEAP, totalling (based on what I was able to get from internet) hundreds
of billions  $$ over the past 30 years (which very roughly is $100 per
household per year)?

All:

I'm writing this post to share with you something you might find both interesting and pertinent to our growing industry. As many of you are aware, qualified energy simulation software is increasingly being applied to buildings for retrofit analysis purposes, and savings predictions generated from simulation software are in many cases being linked to the awarding of financial incentives by outside stakeholders.

Recently BPI (Building Performance Institute) published a standard related to energy simulation which you may be interested in reading: BPI-2400-S-2011 (formerly BPI-107) "Standardized Qualification of Whole House Energy Savings Estimate".  Electronic versions of the standard can be found here: http://bpi.pnl.gov/forumdisplay.php/16-BPI-2400-S-2011-%28formerly-BPI-107%29-Standardized-Qualification-of-Whole-House-Energy-Savings-Estimate.

The standard covers RESIDENTIAL buildings of 4 units or less, and was developed to support the introduction of RESIDENTIAL energy performance based legislation having bi-partisan support. This legislation, titled "Cut Energy Bills at Home Act" was sponsored by Senators Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Diane Feinstein (D-CA) and was introduced into the US Senate in late 2011.  It is often referred to as the "25e" bill.  More information on the 25e bill can be found here: http://www.efficiencyfirst.org/static/files/25EFactSheet.pdf

One important thing to understand is that 25e would not have been introduced without the publishing of BPI-2400-S-2011.  The proposed 25e legislation, while providing RESIDENTIAL building owners similar tax benefits to COMMERCIAL focused IRS 179D existing legislation, differs in many key ways:


a)      25e provides tax credits to building owners, while 179D provides tax deductions to building owners

b)      25e (through referencing BPI-2400-S-2011) provides a procedure for determining standardized estimates of energy savings for existing buildings. This procedure includes elements which account for both the quality of pre-retrofit actual energy bills and standardized operating conditions used for generating standardized savings estimates related to thresholds defined by 25e.

c)       25e (through referencing BPI-2400-S-2011) provides acceptance criteria for error between simulation predicted values and weather normalized end-use energy during the baseline period.

d)      25e (through referencing BPI-2400-S-2011) provides different compliance pathways related to the different levels of data quality of pre-retrofit actual energy bills of an existing building.

After I read the BPI-2400 standard carefully, I interpret it as including an attempt to define a calibration standard for applying qualified energy simulation tools to existing RESIDENTIAL buildings. Interesting!  I began to see the potential benefits related to wide-scale adoption, and could not help thinking about how it might somehow be adapted to be applicable to appropriate commercial buildings.  While acknowledging that calibrated modeling of larger, more complex existing commercial buildings (mixed use office towers, buildings with both process and comfort loads, etc.) should demand a more rigorous approach, I believe a large number of existing commercial buildings such as smaller, stand-alone office/retail/ service buildings could be cost effectively modeled to represent their existing performance using qualified whole building energy simulation tools.  I believe a performance based procedure aimed at these buildings (including qualified energy modeling tools as the core technology) could be a market motivator for driving deep performance improvements. This is because when we start talking about deep retrofits to existing buildings (i.e. projects estimated to save 30,40,50+ % of energy usage) I believe energy simulation tools (even with their shortcomings) represent the best available technology for cost effectively and realistically quantifying the significant interactive effects of multiple ECMs which influence multiple end-uses.

It would seem to me, some adaptation of BPI-2400 to fit another building stock would be useful. For example, with some careful inclusion of COMNET defaults for Input Constraints, and some revision of the Utility Bill criteria to incorporate handling multiple meters of the same fuel, we could have something that, though arguably not perfect, would be 'good enough' to encourage dialogue with stakeholders outside of our community such as IOU and other policy influencers.  If we are able to by consensus craft a vehicle for linking potential incentive awards to actual pre-retrofit performance of commercial buildings along with quality assurance procedures (M&V) for evaluating post retrofit performance as exhibited by utility bill history (considered the truth standard of performance), I think we really have something. I want to start thinking about what an ASHRAE standard representing this might look like.

Regardless of whether 25e passes through Congress and is eventually enacted, it seems to me the purpose and intent of the BPI-2400 standard is now positioned to be referenced by other, more agile institutions, and can and will be applied - and improved over time.  A quality reference standard becomes a very valuable chess piece which can be played over and over again, and I think if carefully crafted,  it will increase the market value and acceptance of energy modeling tools.

Anyways - I'm curious to how others on this listserve who engage in the COMMERCIAL building segments react to what is unfolding in the RESIDENTIAL community. While there is certainly a great deal to  learn - can you also see any opportunities?  One strength of our community is its diversity, and I want to leverage this.  I suspect this listserve includes representation from practitioners, academia, researchers, equipment manufacturers, policy analysts, students, and many other interests - bonded together by a common goal to increase the responsible use of building energy simulation tools in the world we live in.

Next move(s)?

All the Best,

_Chris

Objet : [Bldg-sim] Fan Power and number of fans in the proposed and baseline
design

 

Hello all,

 

I model a residential building with dwelling units and a multipurpose space
(92000 ft2) . It has a schedule  24/7 hour of operation. Proposed design has
2 DOAS unit with 2 AHUs and fan powered boxes. Each unit has it's own FPB.
The baseline design is PTAC.  My proposed design has Forward curved with VFD
Main, return, optional, and exhaust fans. Fan power VAV fans are used as
secondary fans. My Baseline design has FC with VFD  return, optional,
exhaust fans. Main fan is constant volume FC fan.  I use 90.1-2004 standard
for the energy model.

My question is if I have to include FPB from the proposed design for energy
calculations in the baseline design or I have to exclude them from the
proposed design. May be I am doing right and I have to count them in the
proposed design only.

Now my fan power is much higher in the proposed design than in the baseline
design

Please, advise. 

Thank you,


Genia Gorbachinsky

Marc ?

 

WINDOW 6 stores it?s data in an Access database. The default database for
the program is called W6.mdb ? where it is stored by default is based on
your operating system (see our Knowledge Base article about this:
http://windows.lbl.gov/software/Window7VistaIssues.html

 

So if you want to put the WINDOW 6 database on another computer, just make a
copy of the W6.mdb file, put it on the 2nd computer, and then reference it
from the WINDOW program. If it is in the default directory (see the
Knowledge Base article above), WINDOW 6 will find it automatically. If it is
not in the default directory, then you can use the File/Open menu to browse
to the database file and open it that way.

 

The database can have any name you want it to, just make sure to keep the
MDB extension. You could make copies of files and rename them, or you can do
File/Save As from within WINDOW and the program will make a copy with the
new name that you give it and put it in the location where you have
specified.

 

You can also export ?Project Databases? which make new MDB files that have
only data referenced by the windows or glazing systems you have defined,
which makes a much smaller database (you don?t end up having the entire
Glass Library with all the spectral data in it for glass layers that you are
not using in your calculations). How to make a Project Database is described
on our Knowledge Base:

http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/FAQ/ProjectDB.htm

 

Let me know if you have any more WINDOW questions.

Objet : [Bldg-sim] Fan Power and number of fans in the proposed and baseline
design

 

Hello all,

 

I model a residential building with dwelling units and a multipurpose space
(92000 ft2) . It has a schedule  24/7 hour of operation. Proposed design has
2 DOAS unit with 2 AHUs and fan powered boxes. Each unit has it's own FPB.
The baseline design is PTAC.  My proposed design has Forward curved with VFD
Main, return, optional, and exhaust fans. Fan power VAV fans are used as
secondary fans. My Baseline design has FC with VFD  return, optional,
exhaust fans. Main fan is constant volume FC fan.  I use 90.1-2004 standard
for the energy model.

My question is if I have to include FPB from the proposed design for energy
calculations in the baseline design or I have to exclude them from the
proposed design. May be I am doing right and I have to count them in the
proposed design only.

Now my fan power is much higher in the proposed design than in the baseline
design

Please, advise. 

Thank you,


Genia Gorbachinsky

Message-ID: <AF7941E7B0DFE0478941A85552DC8F7A0D1EF115@to1mbx01wp>

I am looking for some guidance in selecting my boundary conditions when modeling a glazing systems in THERM.

A long time ago I attended a THERM training session where they stated that for general projects it was not necessary to model a system to NFRC 100 boundary conditions. They stated we should use a "Simplified" boundary condition model rather than a "comprehensive: one and that a typical, acceptable interior air film coefficient is 8.3 W/mK.

Recently a discussion came up that we should use the "Comprehensive" boundary condition model for every simulation, and that the interior film coefficient should be closer to 3. I did a couple of different runs varying the boundary conditions and the results change significantly. See image below:

[cid:image001.jpg at 01CCD06B.F2C6BA90]

Run 01 is using the default NFRC Conditions. Run 04 is how I was previously taught to do the simulation. Runs 02 and 03 are other variations.

What happens to the model when you set the radiation model to to "Automatic Enclosure Model" compared to "Simplified"?

What boundary conditions (with respect to film coefficients and radiation models) should be used to generate conservative, but realistic results.?


Thanks

LEED Italia imposes that software which is used for the energy simulation has 
to respect the technical standards EN 15265 (Energy performance of buildings - 
Calculation of energy needs for space heating and cooling using dynamic methods 
- General criteria and validation procedures) and EN 15193 (lighting energy 
requirements). Do you know what software respect them? Are certifications 
available?

Dear fellow modellers,
 
We have made a screen cast showing the recently released jEPlus 1.2 in action. Here is the link: http://youtu.be/jBA7Q7npNK4
 
There is also a demonstration of running jEPlus/EnergyPlus on Amazon EC2, an experiment as a result of heated debate on cloud computing between a few E+ users before Christmas. The comment I want to make is, yes it is feasible (and easy) to run E+ on EC2; but if you want performance, you will have to pay. Here is the demo: http://youtu.be/3m6gJUhZe9A. I will post performance results once we have finished comparing different platforms.
 
Also, the version of jEPlus used in this demo will be packaged and made available, soon.
 
Best regards,
 
Yi

I own a small Energy and Sustainability consulting business in Falls Church
Virginia.  I'm looking to hire experienced Energy Molders with experience
on LEED projects.  If you have a strong working knowledge of all aspects of
the LEED Program, thats a plus.  You would have the opportunity to work on
not only energy modeling projects, but also energy audits, LEED
Commissioning, LEED Consulting, and possible solar and residential energy
efficiency projects.  if you're interested, please send a resume to
emo at emoenergy.com

Message-ID: <1BAD70CB2933D247903C009D4CEE7D787A29507DCF@MAILBOXSERVER.corp.ftch.com>

Hi,

Can day-lighting analysis be done in Ecotect for a Sketch-Up .dxf file as well?

When importing a 3-d model in Ecotect, the whole model comes as 1 zone. When I select for Lighting Analysis, the analysis grid is of irregular shape even after selecting within option in window fit grid extents. Does this depend on simplicity of model?

How successful is shading design? Usually it results in extraordinarily big sun-shades.

Thanks,

Sunayana Jain

Well, Ecotect is a pretty good and user-friendly software especially at
initial design stage to my mind. It is able to provide sort of "laymen'
language among energy modeler and other consultants, owners, etc. For your
particular questions, see my two cents below. Hope they are helpful.

Sunayana, please review Prof. Reinhart's paper prior to relying on Ecotect
for daylight simulations.
http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_0196_203.pdf
As a general rule, Ecotect's native daylight simulation engine is
inaccurate, however, the Ecotect software interface can be used as a
visualization tool to view imported simulation results computed by the
Radiance simulation engine.

Kristy-

Did you try to use the "WASTE-HEAT-USE" feature of the PSZ system for humidity control?

[cid:image001.jpg at 01CCD544.BCBF0730]

I've had success using this feature to achieve the desired space humidity conditions with 100% OA units.

I can't remember whether its energy performance is appropriate, but I did verify with hourly reports that the zones in question had accurate humidity control.

I remember having a hard time finding this feature - several late nights with the DOE-2 dictionary - but I eventually found the documentation on Vol 2 - Dictionary - pp398-399 and pp416-417.

Subject: [Equest-users] Lesson Learned: Single Zone Packaged DX vs. Packaged VAV system types

Hi all,

I just wanted to share a lesson learned that I ran across recently while using Equest.  Here are the pertinent specs for the building:


*         Proposed Case

o   65,000 sq ft of laboratory (with ac/hr requirements)

o   Cooling is provided by a chilled water district plant

o   Heating is provided by a district steam boiler plant

o   100% outdoor air

o   Humidity control is being utilized

*         Baseline

o   Per G3.1.1 Exception (c), baseline system type is #3, Packaged DX, Constant Volume, Fossil Fuel Furnace

o   Humidity control is included because it's in the design case (ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Table G3.1 Part 1.b)
[cid:image005.jpg at 01CCD543.F9B33C20]

o   100% outdoor air, or a percentage to match the proposed

Because the ASHRAE baseline system was #3, I used the Equest system type "Packaged Single Zone" for the baseline model and then proceeded to pull my hair out for a day because the baseline model was performing better than the proposed.  Then I decided to try changing the baseline system type to "Packaged VAV" and setting the fan control to "Constant" with the minimum flow ratio set to "1", in order to force it to still be a constant volume system.  The first thing I noticed after only changing the system type was that the cooling energy almost doubled.  The upshot is the following, for these Equest system types:


*         Packaged Single Zone

o   When you add reheat in order to control humidity, the software shows an increase for the heating energy, but does not show an increase in cooling energy.  Cooling energy should also increase because it now has additional heat due to reheat to overcome.  The place to verify humidity control is the SS-N report, which showed that humidity was not being controlled, despite the fact that I had set the maximum humidity to 60% in the inputs.

*         Packaged VAV

o   When you add reheat, the software shows an increase in both heating and cooling energy.  This is correct.  Otherwise, your baseline building will always perform better than the proposed.  Again, verify that humidity is being controlled in the SS-N report.

LESSON LEARNED:  Always use the Packaged VAV system type in Equest when modeling DX equipment.  If you have a constant volume system, just adjust the fan control to be "Constant" and the minimum airflow ratio to be "1".

I hope this makes sense.  Feel free to comment if you've had experience with this.  Thanks!

Hi Alex,

welcome to the world of nerds ;-)

There is an intersting document to start with:
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/pdfs/contrasting_the_capabilities_of_building_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.pdf


That will probably get you a nice intro. If you are into the maths and
equations, check out Joe Clarke's book on building simulation.
Also Jan Hensen recently published one on building simulation.

Good luck and welcome!

Dear All,

The paper from referred to by Alex is no 6-7 years old. There has been a lot
of movement in building simulation since then. 

Has anyone published formally or informally anything since 2005?

My advise to Alex is to start with Energy Plus, as it has the most
development put into it and the mose capabilities.
Also Open studio has some great information as to where to start.

Also to Alex, eQuest is where most people start.
A great and affordable class on eQuest can be found here
http://energy-models.com/training/equest
(I just took it and found it to be very insightful)

I do not think it is a good idea for a beginner to start with Energy Plus.
Bear in mind, it is not so user friendly. Even a senior energy modeler may
not be able to grasp it easily. Equest is more strait-forward to my mind.

Cheney

Alex,

I would agree with Cheney here. The wizards available in eQuest will allow you to create and simulate typical buildings and various scenarios relatively quickly and easily and with a good level of confidence. The documentation which accompanies the eQuest download contains very useful reference and guidance documentation.

Good luck.
Chris

Is anybody interested in dueling software?  My idea (and I'm sure it's 
been done before)...

We define an easy building and everybody models it in whatever they own 
and we compare the results.

Sound like fun?

Good morning everybody

I want to thank you all for all your information and support,

I'm in the process of analyzing  the information received from you.

Thanks everybody for your excellent support and response


I'm open to receive more thoughts from all of you.

With best regards

Alex


P.S. which one of them is more suitable  for building envelope air leakage  analysis ?

Kristy,
Is the cool control in the PVAVS system set to constant (the default)?  If
the answer is yes, you are always cooling 100% of the supply air to the
MIN-S-T unless cooling is scheduled off.  Of course this will require
substantially more cooling and reheat then a PSZ system that cools to the
temp required  by the control zone. I am not sure if you are comparing
apples to apples.

Dear Robert,

That's basically what is done by ASHRAE Standard 140, I think.  Modeling an
"easy" building is not the problem, though.  Modeling a "messy" building is
the challenge and I am not sure, but doubt that a good comparison could be
made since most of the energy analysis software does not allow close
scrutiny of detailed results.

Is anybody interested in dueling software?  My idea (and I'm sure it's been
done before)...

We define an easy building and everybody models it in whatever they own and
we compare the results.

Sound like fun?

Alex,

 

I would agree with Cheney here. The wizards available in eQuest will allow
you to create and simulate typical buildings and various scenarios
relatively quickly and easily and with a good level of confidence. The
documentation which accompanies the eQuest download contains very useful
reference and guidance documentation.

 

Good luck.

Bear in mind, it is not so user friendly. Even a senior energy modeler may

Hi Alex,

 

welcome to the world of nerds ;-)

 

There is an intersting document to start with:

http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/pdfs/contrasting_the_
capabilities_of_building_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.pdf

 

 

That will probably get you a nice intro. If you are into the maths and
equations, check out Joe Clarke's book on building simulation.

Also Jan Hensen recently published one on building simulation.

 

Good luck and welcome!

Good afternoon 

My name is Alex, and I'm new to building simulation world , and i saw you

   what the difference between these two, 

2.i would like to simulate more building envelope, what software suit more
for that ?

Thank you very much for your support  and help

Speaking from an architects perspective and admittedly novice energy simulator, Equest was pretty easy to access, and after going to one of the Equest courses, that made it even more useful.  Alex, however, your tag line indicated you are involved in houses, so in that case Equest may not be appropriate, unless they are large multi-family types.

The documentation which accompanies the eQuest download contains very useful reference and guidance documentation.

Good luck.

Hi Alex,

welcome to the world of nerds ;-)

There is an intersting document to start with:
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/pdfs/contrasting_the_capabilities_of_building_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.pdf


That will probably get you a nice intro. If you are into the maths and equations, check out Joe Clarke's book on building simulation.
Also Jan Hensen recently published one on building simulation.

Good luck and welcome!

Good afternoon

My name is Alex, and I'm new to building simulation world , and i saw you have many simulation software ,

1.from my understanding the most used ones are eQuest and Trace 700, is it true ?,
   what the difference between these two,

2.i would like to simulate more building envelope, what software suit more for that ?

Thank you very much for your support  and help

Hi Alex,

There?s been a lot of good feedback on these lists. I think a question to keep in mind while picking a modeling software is: what is your target building and target output?

You mention envelope performance ? I?ve used some fenestration (window) specific modeling tools in the past when the building type is appropriate and the level of detail needed is not as high as to require a full eQUEST/EnergyPlus model.

Comfen and Resfen developed by LBNL are great tool for commercial and residential analyses of fenestration impacts. I?m sure there are very many other tools that focus on components of a building. That may be an option for you as well.

From one Alex to another, if I had to pick one, my vote would be for eQUEST as an accessible modeling environment with a great user-base (this list-serv and the archives) as well as many people teaching eQUEST classes across the country.

Cheers,
Alex Krickx

Speaking from an architects perspective and admittedly novice energy simulator, Equest was pretty easy to access, and after going to one of the Equest courses, that made it even more useful.  Alex, however, your tag line indicated you are involved in houses, so in that case Equest may not be appropriate, unless they are large multi-family types.

This is a topic of some interest to me for reasons both personal and technical.

On a personal level, I was involved in the original creation of these Commercial Reference 
Buildings, which were then known as
DOE's Benchmark Commercial Buildings, back in 2005 - 2007.  Since my knowledge base, 
especially for building models,
has been in DOE-2,  I created the first set of these building models in DOE-2.1E, which I 
then converted to EnergyPlus using a
doe2ep  (DOE-2 to EnergyPlus) program that I was also working on at the time.  Both sets 
of files were provided to DOE, NREL,
and PNNL at the time of my retirement from LBNL in June 2007.  NREL has continued to work 
on these building models, including
adding to or substituting new ones, so I have no idea how correlated are my original 
prototypes to those now on NREL's web site.

For those interested, the building models that I worked on in both DOE-2.1E and EnergyPlus 
(Version 2.2!) are available on my
Web site at   http://whiteboxtechnologies.com/download_07_DOE_prototype_files.htm
However, please keep in mind the caveat mentioned earlier, since I have not touched these 
files since 2007.

On a technical level, I think it would be a valuable contribution to the simulation 
community to have the DOE Reference Buildings
available for other simulation platforms besides EnergyPlus, in particular for 
eQUEST/DOE-2.2.   I have been contacted by  numerous
people over the past four years expressing the same interest, and I know of at least three 
efforts (not including Mark's :-) ) that are
trying to do this, i.e., recode the DOE Reference Buildings for eQUEST.  However, these 
have remained individual or university efforts,
whereas I think what's needed is a more sustained and vetted effort that would include 
harmonizing the inputs with EnergyPlus,
developing corresponding inputs where harmonization is impossible, as well as comparing 
the results to each other as well as to
measured data.   If these Reference Buildings are to be the industry default or starting 
point for building energy modeling, let's make
them as widely usable and robust as possible.

To Alex C and to add to the last email from Alex K, you might take a closer
look at COMFEN and RESFEN.
Each focuses on quick assessment of window/facade performance with a
minimal learning curve but using powerful analysis engines.

RESFEN (RESidential FENestration) is a two screen interface (text only) to
DOE-2;  with a one screen input it runs a highly defaulted "typical" house
but allows all the fenestration related parameters to be selected and
varied, and provides house energy performance and cost data for output.
Download at http://windows.lbl.gov/software/resfen/resfen.html

COMFEN (COMmercial FENestration) is an easy to use but very powerful
interface to EnergyPlus.  It does full building systems analysis for
multiple "spaces" - on an annual basis, with default HVAC/operating
schedule etc.  It is graphically oriented and "architect friendly", having
been designed with extensive input and collaboration from A/E teams and
consultants. It provides virtually complete access to design and analyze
any fenestration system- you can select from 3000+ glazings from the
WINDOW6 data data base, choose framing sytems, design the facade with
multiple windows, add interior or exterior shading, daylighting etc   It
provides graphic access to all the EnergyPlus climate data.  There are
multiple options for graphic display of output from annual to monthly to
hourly data; energy/peak/comfort/carbon, etc  For 5 zones, on a standard
laptop for an annual 8760 hr calc it takes 30-60 sec;  It includes glare
analysis of facades at user specified hours with a link to Radiance. The
next version will include some natural ventilation strategies and some new
cost databases.  There are tutorial movies and a user manual;  You can
access free downloads at http://windows.lbl.gov/software/comfen/comfen.html
See sample output at
http://windows.lbl.gov/software/comfen/4/comfen_screens.html
provide feedback or ask questions at COMFENHelp at lbl.gov
We plan to add additional new features this year so feedback is welcomed.

Though I do not retract my statement with regards to energy plus and open
studio, I do agree that eQUEST is a great starting point.

I tend to use both, (eQUEST for preliminary, then Energy Plus, then
crossrefrence my Energy Plus model output with the eQUEST run) but started
with Energy Plus because I wanted to be able to model more then just
thermal and electrical energy systems such as, green roofs, solar electric,
solar thermal, vertical & horizontal wind turbines and have been recently
been modeling phase change materials. At first it was a bit intimidating,
but I got a feel for it pretty fast and now do not find the IDF editor to
be a difficult of an interface for input data, and google sketch up can be
used for the geometry and thermal zones.
The exciting thing about energy plus is the open source tools available
from NREL's Open studio project.
http://openstudio.nrel.gov/

And the new "Simergy" interface being realised by Laurence Berkley in April.
http://eetd.lbl.gov/bt/simergy/key.html

Bently havacomp has a new interface as well
http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Products/Hevacomp+Dynamic+Simulation/

And then there is design builder:
http://www.designbuilder.co.uk/content/view/29/44/


To me it makes more since to start with the latest and most powerful
software, that is being funded by the USDOE and is updated every 6 months.
eQUEST is great, but in the long run Energy Plus is a more valuable skill
set in my opinion. Also there are more features, and you can do interesting
things with the output...

A good example of something that is (from my understanding) not possible
with eQUEST my current research for phase change materials, is visualized
in this model of the generic phase change materiel from an example file, as
compared to a baseline building..( currently working on the new version
with bioPCM product data.).
https://docs.google.com/a/setnrgh2o.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Angnu5sp0FF9dFB6RlNYSkZyMW5MUTd0cmNxZGhpbnc&hl=en_US#gid=28


To Robert I am very interested in dueling software! I also have a small
factory that I have yet to do the simulation for with drop box full of
details we could use in the duel ! Please let me know if you want to as it
sounds fun:)

Thank you for the advice,
how about doors, walls, floors and roof ? where I can simulate those ?

Thank you for your time

Have a great day today and a wonderful weekend

To Alex C and to add to the last email from Alex K, you might take a closer look at COMFEN and RESFEN.
Each focuses on quick assessment of window/facade performance with a minimal learning curve but using powerful analysis engines.

RESFEN (RESidential FENestration) is a two screen interface (text only) to DOE-2;  with a one screen input it runs a highly defaulted "typical" house but allows all the fenestration related parameters to be selected and varied, and provides house energy performance and cost data for output.  Download at http://windows.lbl.gov/software/resfen/resfen.html

COMFEN (COMmercial FENestration) is an easy to use but very powerful interface to EnergyPlus.  It does full building systems analysis for multiple "spaces" - on an annual basis, with default HVAC/operating schedule etc.  It is graphically oriented and "architect friendly", having been designed with extensive input and collaboration from A/E teams and consultants. It provides virtually complete access to design and analyze any fenestration system- you can select from 3000+ glazings from the WINDOW6 data data base, choose framing sytems, design the facade with multiple windows, add interior or exterior shading, daylighting etc   It provides graphic access to all the EnergyPlus climate data.  There are multiple options for graphic display of output from annual to monthly to hourly data; energy/peak/comfort/carbon, etc  For 5 zones, on a standard laptop for an annual 8760 hr calc it takes 30-60 sec;  It includes glare analysis of facades at user specified hours with a link to Radiance. The next version will include some natural ventilation strategies and some new cost databases.  There are tutorial movies and a user manual;  You can access free downloads at http://windows.lbl.gov/software/comfen/comfen.html

Hi Alex,

There's been a lot of good feedback on these lists. I think a question to keep in mind while picking a modeling software is: what is your target building and target output?

You mention envelope performance - I've used some fenestration (window) specific modeling tools in the past when the building type is appropriate and the level of detail needed is not as high as to require a full eQUEST/EnergyPlus model.

Comfen and Resfen developed by LBNL are great tool for commercial and residential analyses of fenestration impacts. I'm sure there are very many other tools that focus on components of a building. That may be an option for you as well.

>From one Alex to another, if I had to pick one, my vote would be for eQUEST as an accessible modeling environment with a great user-base (this list-serv and the archives) as well as many people teaching eQUEST classes across the country.

Speaking from an architects perspective and admittedly novice energy simulator, Equest was pretty easy to access, and after going to one of the Equest courses, that made it even more useful.  Alex, however, your tag line indicated you are involved in houses, so in that case Equest may not be appropriate, unless they are large multi-family types.

Alex,

I would agree with Cheney here. The wizards available in eQuest will allow you to create and simulate typical buildings and various scenarios relatively quickly and easily and with a good level of confidence. The documentation which accompanies the eQuest download contains very useful reference and guidance documentation.

Good luck.
Chris

I do not think it is a good idea for a beginner to start with Energy Plus. Bear in mind, it is not so user friendly. Even a senior energy modeler may not be able to grasp it easily. Equest is more strait-forward to my mind.

My advise to Alex is to start with Energy Plus, as it has the most development put into it and the mose capabilities.
Also Open studio has some great information as to where to start.  http://openstudio.nrel.gov/

Dear All,
The paper from referred to by Alex is no 6-7 years old. There has been a lot of movement in building simulation since then.
Has anyone published formally or informally anything since 2005?

Hi Alex,

welcome to the world of nerds ;-)

There is an intersting document to start with:
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/pdfs/contrasting_the_capabilities_of_building_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.pdf


That will probably get you a nice intro. If you are into the maths and equations, check out Joe Clarke's book on building simulation.
Also Jan Hensen recently published one on building simulation.

Good luck and welcome!

Good afternoon

My name is Alex, and I'm new to building simulation world , and i saw you have many simulation software ,

1.from my understanding the most used ones are eQuest and Trace 700, is it true ?,
   what the difference between these two,

2.i would like to simulate more building envelope, what software suit more for that ?

Thank you very much for your support  and help

with best regard

Alex

Yes, of course.  I was thinking of a non-residential one-story wood 
frame, steel studs, or concrete block building with one or two windows 
per side and a cathedral ceiling on a poured slab.  A basement would be 
OK too, but not really necessary.  Either no zoning at all or a core for 
toilets/break rooms and open plan office all around.

I mean REALLY simple.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modeling Phase change materials
Message-ID: <CAC92OQVgtpFAMWjamhHk6Rhrp8bdtNNF1WV5JkiTd2EA5TQCYw@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone have any advice on modeling phase change materials in Energy Pro, or
any other SIM software/workarounds to work in any other SIM software?  I
have projects in CA so Energy Pro would be nice..

My problem is Energy Plus is showing the same results when changing the
enthalpy temperature input as stated bellow...

I am working on modeling phase change materials in Energy Plus, Here is
an example what I am working on creating output visualization (once I get
the modeling figured out)
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Angnu5sp0FF9dFB6RlNYSkZyMW5MUTd0cmNxZGhpbnc

I ran an experiment with the generic data from the example phase change
materials IDF, as well as four varieties of data configuration and bench
marked them against an identical building with no phase change materials
and was very disturbed at the results.

All buildings with phase change use exactly the same amount of energy!
It makes me wonder if the phase change calculations are not really using
the input data, as the energy is the same kBtu for each.. Below is the
graph and here are links to my analysis sheets..


   - Output Data in question
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak5Rfmjyon9idHpKQnI5ZVp5T0UxeThNTTVIcUg0aGc

The results piloted below
[image: no_change.png]

Any help or advise would be great, as I want to compare phase change
products, brands and technologies but if the enthalpy temperature data does
not change the outcome then that seems impossible.

Now THAT would be a better test than I envisioned, Jon.  I was just 
thinking of comparing models, NOT comparing them to a real building.  
Sounds like fun though!

I have two office buildings with data, including energy star portfolio
manager data, and actual utility meeter data. Also I have
architectural data on them.  For the one I have three years data on, the
other only one year.   See the attached for the one with the best data and
let me know if one of these works..

What would be really interesting is if multiple people would model the same
building in the same code, like have two energy Plus simulations, 2 TRNSYS,
2ESp-r, ... to see how, based on the same information, results might differ
...

Jeremiah,

it is already a pretty large building. I assume most people are like me ...
really occupied. A small thing can be smached in between, but not something
that might take me 6 to 8 hours to analyse and model. Should we not look
for something smaller? A might be able to get some data on a passive house
in Belgium. Something less than 200 m2, measured during over a year.

Now THAT would be a better test than I envisioned, Jon.  I was just thinking
of comparing models, NOT comparing them to a real building.  Sounds like fun
though!

I would assume that many such exist, but I , for one, would not know how to
begin to identify one.  Maybe the folks at NREL or LNBL have access to such
data, and maybe one from there could kindly respond to your request?

Yes, of course.  I was thinking of a non-residential one-story wood frame,
steel studs, or concrete block building with one or two windows per side and
a cathedral ceiling on a poured slab.  A basement would be OK too, but not
really necessary.  Either no zoning at all or a core for toilets/break rooms
and open plan office all around.

I mean REALLY simple.

I like you idea,  but to start small and simple would be key for me,  so as
not to commit a large amount of time.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] EnergyPlus Licensing Changes
Message-ID: <20120122160059.75BBD9841B0@zapata.dreamhost.com>

EnergyPlus Licensing has changed.

Please see the full description at:
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_licensing.cfm

An excerpt from the website:

EnergyPlus? licenses are intended to encourage 
the use, improvement, and widespread adoption of 
EnergyPlus. Following is information about the 
licensing framework for EnergyPlus versions 
starting at 7.0, which differs from previous versions in three major ways:
    * No fee executable distribution license. 
There are no fees for use or distribution of 
EnergyPlus in executable form. You may use the 
EnergyPlus executable (either the standalone 
application or the library), combine it with 
other programs, and redistribute it (as either a 
desktop application or a web application), for 
any purpose (commercial or otherwise) free of 
charge. Use of this license requires that you 
refer to the specific EnergyPlus version as "EnergyPlus vX."
    * Open source license. For the first time, 
EnergyPlus is available under an open source 
license. Under this license, which is modeled 
after the Mozilla Public License (MPL) V1.1, you 
may obtain EnergyPlus source code, modify it, 
combine it with other software that is licensed 
under different terms, distribute it, and 
re-license it. The license is "weak copyleft" in 
that it covers only EnergyPlus and its 
modifications going forward. Code that is 
combined with EnergyPlus is not affected. This 
license requires that you distribute the source 
code for EnergyPlus modifications and that you 
refer to the EnergyPlus component of your 
distribution as "a modified version of EnergyPlus 
vX." You may remove the "modified" designation by 
obtaining prior written permission from Berkeley 
Lab. As with any open source license, there is no fee.
    * Less restrictive commercial source license. 
The revised commercial source distribution 
license has been relaxed to permit sub-licensing 
of proprietary modifications to EnergyPlus. Under 
this license, you may obtain EnergyPlus source 
code, modify it, combine it with other software 
that is licensed under different terms, 
distribute it, and re-license it. Unlike the open 
source license, you are not required to make your 
modified EnergyPlus source code available; you 
retain exclusive control over these 
modifications. You are still required to refer to 
your copy of EnergyPlus as "modified." In the new 
licensing framework, this is the only license 
that requires a fee: $10,000 US for the first 
licensed version and $3,000 for major version 
updates. Very few scenarios should require this 
license; the open source license should suit most 
purposes. The fee attached to this license is 
intended to encourage use of the open source 
license, while providing additional rights in cases where they may be needed.

Bug fixes, maintenance releases, and minor 
version releases of EnergyPlus will be made 
available to existing EnergyPlus licensees at no 
additional charge on an "if and when available" 
basis. Obtaining a future major version release 
of EnergyPlus will require a new license. The 
licensing scheme and fee schedule is subject to change for future versions.

These are great,  I wonder if when simplfying energy modeling you loose the
value of some software tools? Without such things as windows, lighting,
HVAC, etc some software may seem like it is a better tool, but then
modeling real world buildings another software tool may work better.. Just
a thought...

	5.0) is Now Available
Message-ID: <082b01ccd94f$b689cdf0$239d69d0$@carmelsoft.com>

Version 5.0 of the gbXML schema is now available for download. For those of
you who are not familiar with gbXML, it is an open XML schema that allows
disparate BIM (Building Information Modeling) and building analysis software
tools to share information with one another. The goal of this
interoperability is to provide a more seamless way to perform building
energy simulation.

 

This latest version includes almost 50 updates over the previous version.
Please click the link below to view the documentation and schema, itself:

For software calibration we start with the simplest envelope of all first.
We can then establish which algorithms require tweaking. We can then change
bits and see what happens. 

We have identified many aspects of the HER software requiring further
investigation.

We are now in the last stages of some intensive subfloor research. 

About to look at reflective versus bulk subfloor insulation, followed by
thermal mass. 

We can mimic internal heat loads and HVAC operation. 

Windows one day in the future when the other envelope elements are tested.

These are great,  I wonder if when simplfying energy modeling you loose the
value of some software tools? Without such things as windows, lighting,
HVAC, etc some software may seem like it is a better tool, but then modeling
real world buildings another software tool may work better.. Just a
thought...

Now THAT would be a better test than I envisioned, Jon.  I was just thinking
of comparing models, NOT comparing them to a real building.  Sounds like fun
though!

Yes, of course.  I was thinking of a non-residential one-story wood frame,
steel studs, or concrete block building with one or two windows per side and
a cathedral ceiling on a poured slab.  A basement would be OK too, but not
really necessary.  Either no zoning at all or a core for toilets/break rooms
and open plan office all around.

I mean REALLY simple.

I like you idea,  but to start small and simple would be key for me,  so as
not to commit a large amount of time.

 

Thanks for your suggestion.

The Institute of Energy and Sustainable Development at De Montfort
University has a PhD studentship available in the area of geothermal
heating and cooling systems. This NERC sponsored studentship is being
carried out in partnership with Mimer Energy (www.mimerenergy.com) one
of the UK's most experienced Ground Source Heat Pump companies. The
student would be based at the University's Leicester campus but would
spend some time working at the company. Mimer Energy Ltd are based in
Falmouth, Cornwall, UK. The studentship provides funds for both fees and
living expenses.

The studentship is available to suitably qualified UK graduates. If you
know of any recent graduates who might be interested I would be grateful
if you could bring this to their attention. Full details of the
studentship are available on our web site at
http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/vacancies/index_studentships.htm

The closing date is 27th February.

Many thanks,
Simon Rees

I use EnergyPro and its floor elements are basic, basic, basic.  Slab, 
floor with crawlspace, floor without crawlspace.  I don't know what you 
call that building you have with stilts.

But if you have response information on your buildings, they would be 
easier to model than a six story building, that's for sure!

Hi Jeremiah,

Please see the more detailed email I just sent you. Just to make sure other members don't do repeat the work I did. I think the problem with your files is that the construction object you are putting the PCMs (Drop Ceiling) was never linked to any of the surfaces of your building (In BuildingSurface:Detailed).

Please let me know if this solves your problem.

Best,

Paulo

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modeling Phase change materials

Anyone have any advice on modeling phase change materials in Energy Pro, or any other SIM software/workarounds to work in any other SIM software?  I have projects in CA so Energy Pro would be nice..

My problem is Energy Plus is showing the same results when changing the enthalpy temperature input as stated bellow...

I am working on modeling phase change materials in Energy Plus, Here is an example what I am working on creating output visualization (once I get the modeling figured out) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Angnu5sp0FF9dFB6RlNYSkZyMW5MUTd0cmNxZGhpbnc

I ran an experiment with the generic data from the example phase change materials IDF, as well as four varieties of data configuration and bench marked them against an identical building with no phase change materials and was very disturbed at the results.

All buildings with phase change use exactly the same amount of energy!
It makes me wonder if the phase change calculations are not really using the input data, as the energy is the same kBtu for each.. Below is the graph and here are links to my analysis sheets..


 *   Output Data in question https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak5Rfmjyon9idHpKQnI5ZVp5T0UxeThNTTVIcUg0aGc
The results piloted below
[cid:image001.png at 01CCD9B2.B3C303D0]

Any help or advise would be great, as I want to compare phase change products, brands and technologies but if the enthalpy temperature data does not change the outcome then that seems impossible.

Hi,

I'm trying to use eQuest for a LEED submission. It aint easy!

I can get my proposed model to run the LEED compliance check and generatw a
LEED baseline model. The trouble is, this baseline has a single large PIU
HVAC system rather than the 9 Packaged system of the proposed model.

IS this valid? Systems very strange to me!

FYI...



If you are thinking about how accurate an energy model may or may not be, there has been quite a bit of work done by the ASHRAE Standard 140 over the last 20 years, including: empirical, comparative and analytical models of the building envelope, air side systems. Standard 140 is a standard method of test for simulation that is used by others to see if the algorithms inside the program are performing correctly. The IEA and others have tests as well, which include side-by-side test boxes.

Jeremiah,

it is already a pretty large building. I assume most people are like me ... really occupied. A small thing can be smached in between, but not something that might take me 6 to 8 hours to analyse and model. Should we not look for something smaller? A might be able to get some data on a passive house in Belgium. Something less than 200 m2, measured during over a year.

Yes, of course.  I was thinking of a non-residential one-story wood frame, steel studs, or concrete block building with one or two windows per side and a cathedral ceiling on a poured slab.  A basement would be OK too, but not really necessary.  Either no zoning at all or a core for toilets/break rooms and open plan office all around.

I mean REALLY simple.

I like you idea,  but to start small and simple would be key for me,  so as not to commit a large amount of time.

Thanks for your suggestion.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] EnergyPlus Licensing Changes


EnergyPlus Licensing has changed.

Please see the full description at:
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/energyplus_licensing.cfm

An excerpt from the website:

EnergyPlus(tm) licenses are intended to encourage the use, improvement, and widespread adoption of EnergyPlus. Following is information about the licensing framework for EnergyPlus versions starting at 7.0, which differs from previous versions in three major ways: 

*	No fee executable distribution license. There are no fees for use or distribution of EnergyPlus in executable form. You may use the EnergyPlus executable (either the standalone application or the library), combine it with other programs, and redistribute it (as either a desktop application or a web application), for any purpose (commercial or otherwise) free of charge. Use of this license requires that you refer to the specific EnergyPlus version as "EnergyPlus vX." 
*	Open source license. For the first time, EnergyPlus is available under an open source license. Under this license, which is modeled after the Mozilla Public License (MPL) V1.1, you may obtain EnergyPlus source code, modify it, combine it with other software that is licensed under different terms, distribute it, and re-license it. The license is "weak copyleft" in that it covers only EnergyPlus and its modifications going forward. Code that is combined with EnergyPlus is not affected. This license requires that you distribute the source code for EnergyPlus modifications and that you refer to the EnergyPlus component of your distribution as "a modified version of EnergyPlus vX." You may remove the "modified" designation by obtaining prior written permission from Berkeley Lab. As with any open source license, there is no fee. 
*	Less restrictive commercial source license. The revised commercial source distribution license has been relaxed to permit sub-licensing of proprietary modifications to EnergyPlus. Under this license, you may obtain EnergyPlus source code, modify it, combine it with other software that is licensed under different terms, distribute it, and re-license it. Unlike the open source license, you are not required to make your modified EnergyPlus source code available; you retain exclusive control over these modifications. You are still required to refer to your copy of EnergyPlus as "modified." In the new licensing framework, this is the only license that requires a fee: $10,000 US for the first licensed version and $3,000 for major version updates. Very few scenarios should require this license; the open source license should suit most purposes. The fee attached to this license is intended to encourage use of the open source license, while providing additional rights in cases where they may be needed. 


Bug fixes, maintenance releases, and minor version releases of EnergyPlus will be made available to existing EnergyPlus licensees at no additional charge on an "if and when available" basis. Obtaining a future major version release of EnergyPlus will require a new license. The licensing scheme and fee schedule is subject to change for future versions.

Yes, good idea, Jeff.  "Ease of use" isn't in there, but then, I guess 
that's not always important.

Do you know of any papers that compare EQuest to EnergyPro to EnergyPlus 
to DOE-2 to TRACE-700 to anything else using ASHRAE 140?

Maybe the publishers of these models have done the ASHRAE 140 work and 
would allow us to see it, but "Ease of Use" is not on their list!

Std 140 comes with example results from various software programs.  However
many tools also publish reports comparing their 140 results on their web
sites.  That information is required to be certified as software for use
for the tax credits for commercial buildings:

Just a hunch, but check the value input for COMPLIANCE:C-901-NUMFLRS. 
See "Step 2: Enter Compliance and Site Parameters Information" in the 
document "LEED Analysis.pdf" found in the Help/Tutorials and Reference 
eQUEST menu selection. Make sure that value reflects the actual 
building. If it's more than 5, and the heat source is "electric and 
other" you will get a PIU baseline system per Table G3.1.1A.

Message-ID: <CAAkkLHG=oGtr+E407x_cSJhQeYUtnoevrKDejSNma98-1sDd=A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I am working on a rather large model in EE4 and the simulation runs but no
reference is created. Taking a closer look at the BDL file, the following
error is noted: EXCEEDED MAXIMUM FOR THIS ITEM OF 2048. Is there a way to
get the reference building to generate without merging many of the zones to
decrease the size of the model?

Thanks,

Hi Oleksandra,

EE4 can work with up to 100 zones.  If you have more than that, you may want to consider merging some of them anyhow, for ease of modeling/review.  The other option I can think of is creating your reference building directly in DOE2.

Are you sure the ITEM referred to is zones though?  I don't know off the top of my head what the maximums are for things like windows or lighting or surfaces, or if there are explicit maximums, but the 2048 makes it sound to me like this may be something other than number of zones.  The error should be shown right under the thing that caused it, so it should be pretty easy to tell what the issue is.

Good luck!

Alex

IBPSA Seattle Chapter Brainstorming Meeting

Some of us local energy modelers are contemplating forming a Seattle area IBPSA-USA chapter. IBPSA-USA is the United States regional affiliate of the International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA)<http://www.ibpsa.org/>. The mission of IBPSA-USA is to advance and promote the science of building simulation in order to improve the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of new and existing buildings in the United States. We are in contact with IBPSA national and are following their recommendations on initial organizing steps.

At this time we would like to hear from anyone interested in forming a local chapter. If there is a sufficient response, we will convene to brainstorm local topics of interest and start to shape the direction of a future local chapter. To get a count of people who are potentially interested in an IBPSA Seattle chapter, please lets us know you are interested by filling out the following one question survey: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SCWLQKN We have scheduled a brainstorming meeting for the evening of Friday, January 27th, 2012.  If you are interested in attending the brainstorming session, please RSVP at http://groupspaces.com/IBPSASeattle. You can also join the group at http://groupspaces.com/IBPSASeattle  We would keep you informed about upcoming events and presentations through occasional emails.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED and infiltration
Message-ID: <202912C8EDB23349AE5037B8C2D2301205AE5DF202@cn-exmbs-1.Corp.ClarkNexsen.com>

All,

I am working on the design of a project which includes specification of an air barrier in the building envelope and post-construction testing to confirm its performance.  I would like to take credit for this in my energy modeling calculations for LEED EAc1.  I have seen previous discussions on this mailing list about the lack of a baseline number for air leakage in ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G being an issue.  I am also aware of the fact that performing a precise simulation of infiltration for a building would be complex and take into account wind pressures/directions, building pressurization, massing, etc. etc.  However, page 36 of the Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED Technical Manual appears to reference a scenario in which credit can be taken for reduced infiltration, and there are CIRs that state that such credit can be taken if proper documentation is supplied.  My question is:  has anyone received a favorable review of an energy model that claimed savings due to reduced infiltration as part of LEED project documentation?  If so, what methodology/baseline data was employed?  Any insights would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

In addition to the IEA and ASHRAE validation work already described there are also a bunch of CEN standards for energy simulation tools.

One interesting development from a few years ago that may be of interest was that the actual models used for the validation tests for the ESP-r tool were embedded into the software (i.e. they are distributed with it and can be invoked by users from the interface). This gives the user two opportunities: they can check that they get the same answer on their OS/hardware and they can see how the 'experts' modelled the test cases.

Std 140 comes with example results from various software programs.  However many tools also publish reports comparing their 140 results on their web sites.  That information is required to be certified as software for use for the tax credits for commercial buildings:  http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tax_commercial.html and http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/qualified_software.html

If you are thinking about how accurate an energy model may or may not be, there has been quite a bit of work done by the ASHRAE Standard 140 over the last 20 years, including: empirical, comparative and analytical models of the building envelope, air side systems. Standard 140 is a standard method of test for simulation that is used by others to see if the algorithms inside the program are performing correctly. The IEA and others have tests as well, which include side-by-side test boxes.

Jeremiah,

it is already a pretty large building. I assume most people are like me ... really occupied. A small thing can be smached in between, but not something that might take me 6 to 8 hours to analyse and model. Should we not look for something smaller? A might be able to get some data on a passive house in Belgium. Something less than 200 m2, measured during over a year.

Yes, of course.  I was thinking of a non-residential one-story wood frame, steel studs, or concrete block building with one or two windows per side and a cathedral ceiling on a poured slab.  A basement would be OK too, but not really necessary.  Either no zoning at all or a core for toilets/break rooms and open plan office all around.

I mean REALLY simple.

That way, one could not only have "precision " but also some baseline of "accuracy".

I like you idea,  but to start small and simple would be key for me,  so as not to commit a large amount of time.

Thanks for your suggestion.

Message-ID: <CANSEwusGH0bLPdtO=usymbpUN243pucfchrLS0bJakuTjXCZiw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Bldg-Sim,
IBPSA Boston in conjunction with IES Boston is excited to present our next
event, Daylight Simulation in Design, on February 7th from 6:00-7:30pm EST
at MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  We have two groups of
speakers who will present some interesting applications of daylight
simulation in architecture projects.  As usual,  the event will be webcast
and web-archived.  Please RSVP to ibpsa.boston at gmail.com if you plan to
attend in person.  Details below.
(Also, please save the date for our next event/webcast, a joint meeting the
evening of March 13 with ASHRAE and AEE.)

*Daylight Simulation in Design
*February 7, 6:00-7:30pm EST
MIT, building 7 (aka 77 Massachusetts Ave.) room 431 (aka the Long Lounge)
Social event to follow at a local pub TBD.  Munchies provided.

*Presentation Synopses:
*Schroepfer + Hee?s New Jurong Church (planned for completition in 2013) is
an approximately 10,000 sqm religious and cultural facility located in the
densely populated western part of Singapore. The presenters will discuss
how, with the need to mitigate the harsh climate conditions of the tropics
and yet not have a high dependence on mechanical cooling systems, the
conception and design of the building envelope employed state-of-the-art
lighting and energy use simulations to make full use of passive systems,
leading to an understanding of architecture in that form, material,
structure and performance are not seen as separate elements, but rather as
complex interrelations.

Daylight modeling can be a powerful tool in the professional architectural
world, but it can also create various challenges. Using examples from their
work at Lam Partners, the presenters will show ways in which daylight
modeling can be crafted strategically to support design ideas, as well as
some of the hurdles to using this type of analysis on projects. The
presentation will touch upon topics such as cost, efficiency and marketing.
*Speakers:
*Thomas Schroepfer, Associate Professor at Singapore University of
Technology and Design and Principal at Schroepfer + Hee
Alstan Jakubiec, PhD Candidate at MIT
Azadeh Omidfar, Researcher at MIT, Designer at Einhorn Yaffee Prescott
Glenn Heinmiller, Principal at Lam Partners
Kera Lagios, Designer at Lam Partners

*Remote Access Instructions:
*We will broadcast the session using AnyMeeting. You may register ahead of
time, which would be helpful to us, or sign-in without registering once the
meeting starts.  The URL for the broadcast will be:

FYI. 

RP1468, which involves developing guidelines for BIM to thermal models, is currently in progress and scheduled for completion in June 2012. It has one test case that attempted to compare DOE2.1e to DOE2.2 and EP+ for the SAMP1E, run 3A file. The results show 2.1e and 2.2 only agree at the envelope level to within 20% (I.e. System sum) or so, and 2.1e to EP+ has even larger disagreement. The final report will have over 1 GByte of files for review, including Autodesk, Bentley and Archicad BIM files for about 20+ test cases. 

So, there is still work to do, especially when one considers that development work for 90.1, 90.2, and 189 are now only being simulated with EP+, which means users who uses a DOE2 derivative for 90.1 compliance will have trouble duplicating the tabulated results in the standard within 20%.

Std 189 will eventually have even more trouble as it also covers peak reductions, yet has scant advice has been provided about how to calculate peak loads using a simulation and TMY2 or TMY3 weather files...which will oversize if one is not careful.

Jeremiah,

 

it is already a pretty large building. I assume most people are like me ... really occupied. A small thing can be smached in between, but not something that might take me 6 to 8 hours to analyse and model. Should we not look for something smaller? A might be able to get some data on a passive house in Belgium. Something less than 200 m2, measured during over a year.

	Yes, of course.  I was thinking of a non-residential one-story wood frame, steel studs, or concrete block building with one or two windows per side and a cathedral ceiling on a poured slab.  A basement would be OK too, but not really necessary.  Either no zoning at all or a core for toilets/break rooms and open plan office all around.

Hello Brian.

We ran into a similar case for a project designed to exceed MNECB 1997 (Canadian model energy code).

The answer we got was that, in fact, they had no idea what would be the infiltration rate of a building designed to meet code, basically because usual material testing is done to obtain infiltration rates based on material type, but not on overall assembly and typical construction practices. Thus, they have no way to establish an absolute numeric reference infiltration rate.

Looking at ASHRAE 90.1-2007, I don't see infiltration requirements with better (more specific/detailed) requirements than what we see in MNECB. So I'd expect you'll run into the same limitation.

For information: The energy software used for modeling against MNECN 1997 (EE4/DOE-2) assumes a fixed infiltration rate of 0.05 cfm/ft? of gross outside wall, both for the reference and the proposed building (without being able to assume a different value). OTOH, recent discussions I had with people involved in this field have indicated that the actual typical infiltration rate for commercial buildings is more in the range of 0.25 cfm/ft?.

Objet?: [Bldg-sim] LEED and infiltration

All,

I am working on the design of a project which includes specification of an air barrier in the building envelope and post-construction testing to confirm its performance.  I would like to take credit for this in my energy modeling calculations for LEED EAc1.  I have seen previous discussions on this mailing list about the lack of a baseline number for air leakage in ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G being an issue.  I am also aware of the fact that performing a precise simulation of infiltration for a building would be complex and take into account wind pressures/directions, building pressurization, massing, etc. etc.  However, page 36 of the Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED Technical Manual appears to reference a scenario in which credit can be taken for reduced infiltration, and there are CIRs that state that such credit can be taken if proper documentation is supplied.  My question is:  has anyone received a favorable review of an energy model that claimed savings due to reduced infiltration as part of LEED project documentation?  If so, what methodology/baseline data was employed?  Any insights would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Brian A. Turner P.E., CEM, LEED AP BD+C

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Mass of framed cavity layer mass
Message-ID: <4F2098D0.50504@gmail.com>

Hello-
I am curious to know if anyone is aware of research or other work that 
has investigated the impact of including the mass of the wood or 
steel-framed cavity/insulation layer in the opaque surface definitions 
of whole building energy models.

I am aware of ASHRAE RP-1145, which outlines a method for developing 
"equivalent wall" models of various assemblies, and appears to include 
the mass of the framing/insulation layer.  However, this research does 
not appear to evaluate the impact of mass of this one material layer 
separately.  I believe it is common to account for mass of other layers, 
particularly concrete/masonry, but my experience is the cavity layer is 
only simulated with thermal resistance and no mass.

Any leads would be appreciated.
Thanks,
David

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Additions And Alteration mandatory provision
Message-ID: <1327572504.32556.YahooMailNeo@web125905.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi guys,
?
I just want to make sure that I'm on the right track. Im working on a core and shell project that has an expansion and existing building that will have envelope renovation. ASHRAE 90.1-2007 User's Manual says:
?
?

"Additions and Alterations
(Table G3.1-2)
?
For building additions, the designer has
the choice of including the existing
building in the calculation of the percent
energy savings or excluding it. If the
existing building is excluded, then the
following conditions must be met.
?
? If there is any new work covered by
the Standard that is in a part of the
existing building that will be excluded
from the proposed design modeling, then
those parts must comply with the
Standard?s applicable mandatory and
prescriptive requirements."

?
Both existing and expansion building will be served by the same HVAC system so I decided to include the existing building in the model. With enough savings to comply with eQp1, does this mean that the envelope renovations of the existing building do not need to comply with the mandatory provisions (5.4)? How about the expansion builoding envelope?
Any comment is appreciated.
?
?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] New High School Additon for LEED certification -
	Geothermal System
Message-ID: <DUB103-W586C4EF7E38831208F6B2AE08E0@phx.gbl>




Hi all,

 

Our company has been recently engaged to provide LEED energy
modeling services for an addition to an existing high school which is approx.
30 years old. The new addition is being targeted for LEED gold certification. I
have previously performed LEED energy modeling services for a new university
building which is targeting LEED gold also. My question is, how does an
addition differ from an entirely new build? I assume that you still have to
model the existing building systems complete with the new mechanical system for
the extension and compare it against the baseline just like a new build?

 

Also, the high school is looking at overhauling the existing
mechanical system which is a conventional chiller/boiler system. There are two
options:

1)      Replace
the existing chiller (30 years old and inadequately sized for the new
extension) with a new chiller in line with current standards and sized to meet
the new additional loads.

2)      Install
a geo-thermal system with back up provided by the conventional system.

 

We are responsible for the feasibility study of Option 1. I
have already constructed the energy model using IES and we are waiting back
from the other consultant with their results from the geo-thermal study. Both results will go to the school board and they will have the final say as to what system is going to be installed. My
final questions are:

1)      If
it does end up that the geo-thermal option is the more cost effective option
and is chosen by the school board ? what baseline system do you choose to model
this? The school has a floor area of approx. 250,000 square feet with two
levels above ground and a basement.

2)      Has
anyone done a geo-thermal model using IES? Since I have the model built already
through the feasibility study, I don?t want to have to build another model
using a different program. 


 

I would greatly appreciate any advice as I am still pretty
inexperienced when it comes to LEED modeling.

 

Thanks

 

Donal

All,

After the discussion that occurred late last year regarding NREL's Commercial Building Energy Modeler Job/Task Analysis, I thought some of you might be interested to know that the document is now out for survey validation (see http://www.nrel.gov/buildings/workforce.html). It looks like this step is where the task weighting factors come from, but the website gives more information. Just thought some of you might be interested in providing responses.

Cheers,
Kristin

Subject: [Bldg-sim] incorporating district heat transmission losses
Message-ID: <20879A97265F4ABD87F9A831D4C3D1D5@D3J1MNH1>

I am modeling an office building for LEED that uses district heating. I am
electing Option 2 (full accounting) - the aggregate building / DES scenario
under the Performance Path as described by USGBC in their document entitled
Treatment of District or Campus Thermal Energy in LEED V2 and LEED 2009 -
Design & Construction. As I must create an on-site hot water boiler in the
proposed model, I am curious how other modelers go about factoring in the
leaks and thermal losses of the upstream transmission and distribution
system. In the aforementioned document under 2.4.1.2.1 Efficiency
calculation it states
Proposed building, transmission and distribution system: secondary pumping
energy, leaks, and thermal losses between the DES central plant and the
connected building in both directions must be accounted for in the Proposed
Case model for all cases where they apply. Projects shall use actual DES
operational data if the DES is pre-existing, or for new DES's design
estimates based on expected operation may be substituted.

I know the existing DH plant efficiency and also a separate percentage for
the upstream-from-building losses. How best to combine these to pass USGBC
reviewer muster is the question. Thank you in advance.

Hi Holly,

Attached pdf is what I presented for my course in 2009.
I did quick internet search and added my interpretations and examples.

After that I have discovered entire issue of Energy and Buildings, 9
(1 and 2) 1986 on PRISM that can give you more details and references
regarding weather adjustments.

Today's state of the art you may check  within the scope of two (2)
bigger and broader interrelated  topics: Calibration and Measurement &
Verification

One of useful sources off the top of my head  "International
Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol" and
www.evo-world.org September 2010 EVO 10000.

Pavel

I think using 0.25 cfm/ft2 is a bit excessive for energy modeling purposes, unless, maybe, you are varying infiltration rate to account for wind & stack effects and the 0.25  is a peak value. (The 0.05 was a  value picked by the energy code Task group after discussions with NRC staff specializing in infiltration & modeling for the sole purpose of demonstrating compliance with the Code)
For the sample office/retail building in EE4, using 0.05 leakage results in an infiltration load that represents around 18% of the net envelope peak heat loss. Ramping it up to 0.25 put the value up to more than 1/2 the envelope load. I don't believe we are building buildings that poorly in Canada.

Since  the value was chosen solely to be used for demonstrating compliance it should not be construed as a design value for load estimation. Note too that in the EE4 compliance model, this rate occurs over all faces of the building which in practice cannot happen, what goes in must come out!

Hope this helps

Hello Brian.

We ran into a similar case for a project designed to exceed MNECB 1997 (Canadian model energy code).

The answer we got was that, in fact, they had no idea what would be the infiltration rate of a building designed to meet code, basically because usual material testing is done to obtain infiltration rates based on material type, but not on overall assembly and typical construction practices. Thus, they have no way to establish an absolute numeric reference infiltration rate.

Looking at ASHRAE 90.1-2007, I don't see infiltration requirements with better (more specific/detailed) requirements than what we see in MNECB. So I'd expect you'll run into the same limitation.

For information: The energy software used for modeling against MNECN 1997 (EE4/DOE-2) assumes a fixed infiltration rate of 0.05 cfm/ft? of gross outside wall, both for the reference and the proposed building (without being able to assume a different value). OTOH, recent discussions I had with people involved in this field have indicated that the actual typical infiltration rate for commercial buildings is more in the range of 0.25 cfm/ft?.

All,

I am working on the design of a project which includes specification of an air barrier in the building envelope and post-construction testing to confirm its performance.  I would like to take credit for this in my energy modeling calculations for LEED EAc1.  I have seen previous discussions on this mailing list about the lack of a baseline number for air leakage in ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G being an issue.  I am also aware of the fact that performing a precise simulation of infiltration for a building would be complex and take into account wind pressures/directions, building pressurization, massing, etc. etc.  However, page 36 of the Advanced Energy Modeling for LEED Technical Manual appears to reference a scenario in which credit can be taken for reduced infiltration, and there are CIRs that state that such credit can be taken if proper documentation is supplied.  My question is:  has anyone received a favorable review of an energy model that claimed savings due to reduced infiltration as part of LEED project documentation?  If so, what methodology/baseline data was employed?  Any insights would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Holly,

I don't agree with using PRISM for normalizing a simulation. PRISM is a variable based degree day method that was developed for weather normalizing heating energy use in residential. As such, for a commercial building, a VBDD might not be the best model. I'd suggest you see the 1050RP papers regarding the use of change-point linear models for use with commercial buildings that give you a superior fit to the data. 

Unfortunately, I can only think of one reason to normalize a simulation to actual year data, and that would be if you are comparing it to measured energy use data. Otherwise, there is no benefit in normalizing a simulation if you are using a TMY3 file. 

If you are comparing it to measured energy data. Then you need to drive the model with measured weather data, which makes a hugh improvement in fitting the model to the measured data, including predicting demand. 

However, the devil is in the details. For starters, I'd suggest you read the following:

Haberl, J., Bou-Saada, T. 1998. ?Procedures for Calibrating Hourly Simulation Models to Measured Building Energy and Environmental Data,? ASME Journal of Solar Energy Engineering, Vol. 120, pp. 193 - 204 (August). 

Song, S., Haberl, J. 2008. ?A Procedure for the Performance Evaluation of a New Commercial Building: Part I ? Calibrated As-built Simulation?,  ASHRAE Transactions-Research, Vol. 114, Pt. 2, pp. 375-388 (June ).

Song, S., Haberl, J. 2008. ?A Procedure for the Performance Evaluation of a New Commercial Building: Part II ? Overall Methodology and Comparison of Results?,  ASHRAE Transactions-Research, Vol. 114, Pt. 2, pp. 389 ? 403 (June).

You'll also find dozens of other papers on calibration of simulation models as well as MS and PhD thesis at our web site www.esl.tamu.edu under publications, as well as about 3,000 papers from the Hot and Humid, IETC and ICEBO conferences (on various other subjects).

Hi Holly,

Attached pdf is what I presented for my course in 2009.
I did quick internet search and added my interpretations and examples.

After that I have discovered entire issue of Energy and Buildings, 9
(1 and 2) 1986 on PRISM that can give you more details and references
regarding weather adjustments.

Today's state of the art you may check  within the scope of two (2)
bigger and broader interrelated  topics: Calibration and Measurement &
Verification

One of useful sources off the top of my head  "International
Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol" and
www.evo-world.org September 2010 EVO 10000.

Regards,
Pavel

Subject: [Bldg-sim] the use of dynamic energy simulation tool
Message-ID: <000001cce0a1$74acf430$5e06dc90$@skku.edu>

Dear all, 

 

I have been thinking about the use of dynamic energy simulation tool (e.g.
whole building simulation tool, such as E+, ESP-r, TRNSYS, SPARK, etc). 

 

The usage area of the tool would be classified into two, academic area and
practical area.

 

But I really want to hear your high-level opinion on the practical areas.

 

The typical usage of energy simulation program in practice could be listed
as follows (as far as I know), 

 

1.     To get energy efficiency incentives, such as LEED certificate. 

2.     To compare alternatives (wall material, window, building design) in
architect point of view. 

3.     To compare alternatives (system type and configuration, COP, etc.)
in mechanical engineer point of view. 

4.     To develop energy efficient control strategies and to test DDC
controllers. (BEMS and emulation; maybe electric engineering field or ??)

5.     To identify the system mal-function (such as AHU) comparing between
?predicted? energy and ?actual? energy in real-time. (BEMS, maybe
electric engineering field??)

6.     Building Simulator: which is used to training building managers or
operators or learners (students) in HVAC system operation realistically
(such as flight simulator)

7.     To ?JUST? verify Building behavior (HVAC operation, energy
consumption, etc) over the whole year period with different whether
conditions in IWEC and TMY. (to see "what could be")

 

I think that the large portion of usage would be #1. 

 

But, the problem have been arisen due to the uncertainties and ?too many?
required input values of dynamic simulation tools. 

 

As far as I know in South Korea, many people say ?these tools are not
suited to assess building energy performance with acceptable speed. And
there is no evidence it is helpful to achieve energy reduction actually.
Something are missing. We (AEC) do not want to do full dynamic simulation.
We just need a tool that is simple and faster and reliable?. 

 

These days, the government is willing to move their direction which
requires architects just to submit a building energy analysis report using
simple ISO toolkit. 

(many of my colleague agree to need of the normative performance method,
ISO 13790 and DIN 18599.)

 

Now, in this situation, we have to rethink about the purpose of doing full
dynamic energy simulation (E+, ESP-r, TRNSYS, etc) with practicality in
mind.

 

I think that its usage would be more suitable for #4, #5, #6 rather than
#1, #2, #3. Because #1,#2,#3 can be evaluated using ISO standards with
acceptable speed and accuracy. 

(but I do not know well about the usage in the fields of #4, #5, #6)

 

I?m waiting your comments on my thoughts.

 

p.s. this topic was discussed in E+ user group before, and the contents are
slightly revised for better discussions. 

 

Best Regards, 
Deuk-Woo, Kim
