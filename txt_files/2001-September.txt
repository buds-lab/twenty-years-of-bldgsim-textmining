Subject: [BLDG-SIM] extracting hourly humidity
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200109050942.AA420328pd80000073922@gard.com>


I am trying to extract the hourly temperature and humidity for a space in a
DOE2.1e simulation.  Temperature is easy enough -- for VARIABLE-TYPE = u
name for zone, VARIABLE-LIST = (6) or (31) does the trick.  But what about
humidity?  Variable 47 is not appropriate on many system types yet report
SS-N gives me a zonal relative humidity plot.

So far my best guess is to use the return air humidity ratio.  Any other
suggestions?

Many thanks

Brian

Return air humidity ratio V-T = system, V-L = (35) is also what we have used
for obtaining zone humidity data.  Such zone humidity ratio results give
good agreement with analytical solutions developed for a single-zone test
case using a validation procedure ("HVAC BESTEST") that will be published in
the near future by National Renewable Energy Laboratory in conjunction with
the International Energy Agency.

Gentlemen, I receive your emails daily and learn from them. However, one
question which we as Australians are wrestling with at the moment in our
consideration of energy auditing regulations.

The motivation to consume more energy comes from an occupant's desire to
feel comfortable. A very significant factor in a person's perception of
comfort is radiant heat. How does DOE2 deal with radiant heat exchange?

Subject: [BLDG-SIM] How to model a soil covered earth roof in DOE2?
Message-ID: <MDAEMON-F200109102052.AA523832pd80000075445@gard.com>

Hello,

I am trying to get an approximate energy savings from adding a 'green
roof' (6" soil with living grass) to a flat roofed building.  Currently, I
see how to define a 'soil' layer, which will account for the u-value and
thermal mass of the soil. I do not see how to account for the evaporative
cooling effects (the grass will be properly watered).  I expect the
cooling to be rather small since the roof would have R-19 insulation under
the grass, so I am leaning towards neglecting them.

The other issue I would appreciate comments on is modeling the roof
surface temperature.  Is there an option to give the roof surface a
maximum temperature (it should not get above the ambient wetbulb), or do I
need to just settle with the absorbance of green?  This is really another
aspect of the evaporative cooling question.

The building will be a two story, flat roofed building in a pretty cold
climate (near Denver, Colorado, USA).  The grass roof is desirable for
non-energy reasons (esthetics and process water disposal) so this
calculation doesn't need to be overly precise (I would not be using DOE2
for it except I already have a fair DOE2 model I can quickly tweak into
shape).  Any advice or experience on forcing DOE2 into doing this?

Thanks,

John Weale, P.E.

Please consider attending and advise other interested persons about the
National Institute of Building Sciences, (Building Environment and Thermal
Envelope Council  (BETEC) Symposium and Workshop via your e-mail lists and
other contacts.  Hotel rate of $90/single or double is good until Sept 15.
The Symposium, titled "Sustainable Buildings III" is on October 17 and 18
in Santa Fe, NM.  The Symposium is preceded by a BETEC workshop on October
13-16 in El Rito, NM (1 hour drive from Santa Fe); where home builders,
potential owner builders, state and local energy and building code
officials can get hands-on experience of scientifically improved "old" low
tech; and "new" high tech techniques such as rammed earth, load bearing
strawbale walls, papercrete structures (recycled paper/cement), composite
structures (extremely high tech), adobe, earth tire walls, and compressed
sustainable, insulation (QuickFill) walls.  The workshop topics are also
presented at the Symposium.  Presenters are from academia, industry, DOE
labs, and entrepreneurs.

     Desired outcome of this BETEC Symposium and Workshop: Tech transfer on
development of technologies that drop the cost of constructing durable
houses so that the money saved can be used for more insulation, more energy
efficient heating and cooling equipment etc.

     Further details and updates to the program are on the website of the
National Institute of Building Sciences at NIBS.ORG or

Dear Farraj,
	Prebid does consider airgaps. They are added to wall descriptions as any other material would be. You will find the various air gap layers at the end of the library of wall materials. Please let me know if you have further trouble finding them.
Cheers,

Colleagues,

We are looking for an esp-r climate file to do some overheating analysis for
a building in London. The appropriate (warmer) years would be one of the
following: 1997, 1993, 1983, 1976.

Has anyone come across a climate file for London for either of the above
years and could make it available to us?

Many thanks.
Best regards.

you have answered any of this type of question or have 
asked and received an  answer, I'm asking for your help. 
Please send me an e-mail directly to me, not to the list, 
with the following information.  The closer you can get it 
to the format the better:

  Program: <program name or 'General'>

  Location: <city>, <state>, <country> 

  Question: <from question e-mail>

  Answer: <from answer e-mail>

I'll assemble all the responses to this e-mail, add a table

the web site.  (Notice that I don't promise when.)

If someone wants to volunteer to help out in the assembling

Jon --

I don't know of a source for a map, but I do have a question ... what do 
you want it for?

I am trying to learn how people use this statistic.  It has been 
traditionally observed, so people keep observing it.  I am involved in work 
on ASHRAE TC 4.2 (Weather Information) that is developing methods for 
extracting solar radiation from weather data measured by ASOS (Automated 
Surface Observation System) now used to observe weather at most sites in 
the US.  ASOS has planned to add sunshine meters to their machines (that 
plan is now delayed due to funding), but it would be just about as easy, 
and much more useful (in our opinion) to measure solar radiation.  Sunshine 
fraction is a notoriously bad predictor of solar radiation (the 
correlations are pretty poor).  With trivial data processing, 
minute-by-minute solar radiation data can be used to estimate sunshine, but 
not vice-versa.

Thus as far as I know the solar and building simulation community has no 
use for sunshine data -- the statistic should be declared obsolete from our 
point of view.  However, at every opportunity, I try to find why people 
want it, there may be some other uses that we don't know about.

So, if you're willing, please let me know what you're up to.

To the rest of BLDG-SIM: anyone else know of uses for sunshine fraction?

Thanks, Chip Barnaby

I wanted to compare FPS plots against radiation plots so I could learn more about their correlation (or lack thereof) in different locales.  I planned to use one or the other to help me get a sense for possible regional variation in daylighting/dimming controls savings potential.  I had a lot easier time finding radiation data, if it is any consolation to you in your mission, Chip. but I thought sunshine data would be better to use if available.  Tabular data is better for quantitative analysis of course, but I wanted to see pictures.

FYI two good sources for solar radiation plots are:

    -  http://www.homepower.com/solmap.htm 
       for an annual plot (attractive training illustration),

    -  http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/redbook/atlas/Table.html 
       for monthly plots by various orientations ( a better analytical tool).

Not to be too contrary but I spot-checked the tabular data from the source in my original email with the homepower map above and the general patterns do seem to correlate pretty well. 

Finally, for those of you that are interested, Jeff Haberl responded to me directly with a FPS resource: "I believe that there is a map on Kreith and Kreider's Solar energy handbook...that shows this for the world...using the Angstrom-Lof minutes of sunshine."  Thanks to Jeff.

Jon --

I don't know of a source for a map, but I do have a question ... what do you want it for?

I am trying to learn how people use this statistic.  It has been traditionally observed, so people keep observing it.  I am involved in work on ASHRAE TC 4.2 (Weather Information) that is developing methods for extracting solar radiation from weather data measured by ASOS (Automated Surface Observation System) now used to observe weather at most sites in the US.  ASOS has planned to add sunshine meters to their machines (that plan is now delayed due to funding), but it would be just about as easy, and much more useful (in our opinion) to measure solar radiation.  Sunshine fraction is a notoriously bad predictor of solar radiation (the correlations are pretty poor).  With trivial data processing, minute-by-minute solar radiation data can be used to estimate sunshine, but not vice-versa.

Thus as far as I know the solar and building simulation community has no use for sunshine data -- the statistic should be declared obsolete from our point of view.  However, at every opportunity, I try to find why people want it, there may be some other uses that we don't know about.

So, if you're willing, please let me know what you're up to.

To the rest of BLDG-SIM: anyone else know of uses for sunshine fraction?

Thanks, Chip Barnaby


  Does anyone out there have or know of a source for a graphical illustration of Fraction of Possible Sunshine over the U.S.  I found a very good table of such data at http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp021/ (file #12), but haven't had any luck with a map.  Thanks in advance.

Thanks ... I would expect that sunshine would correlate with solar 
radiation on a long-term basis.  Hourly correlations have not worked well, 
though.  As a bldg-simulationist, I want hourly data.

If you do find useful relationships, that would be great -- you should 
publish your results.

Jon,
 
SkyCalc is simple to use tool to look at daylighting potential from
skylights and daylight harvesting controls potentials.  SkyCalc is an Excel
spreadsheet that uses preprocessed DOE-2 hourly outputs to generate energy
savings estimates for different fractions of roof area covered with
skylights and under different lighting control strategies.
 
SkyCalc is free and is available with climate specific "weather files" for
34 locations.  SkyCalc can be downloaded from www.h-m-g.com

Dear BLDG-SIM subscribers,

Thermal Energy System Specialists (TESS) it pleased to announce that they will be offering a three day TRNSYS training course in January 2002. TRNSYS is a very flexible thermal modeling tool akin to DOE2 and EnergyPlus. It has been under continual development by the University of Wisconsin, TESS and three other commercial partners in Europe for over 25 years. You can find out more about TRNSYS by visiting the website http://www.trnsys.com. Some of the course topics are listed below and complete information on the TRNSYS Training 2002 course is available on the TESS website at http://www.tess-inc.com. 

Course topics will include:
- Use of the standard TRNSYS programs IISiBat and Prebid
- Modeling buildings in TRNSYS (both conventional and unconventional designs)
- Creating distributable TRNSYS applications using TRNSED
- Adding new capabilities and component models to TRNSYS
- Using SimCad with TRNSYS. SimCad is a CAD based tool for simaltaneously creating a graphical representation and a thermal model of a building in TRNSYS
- Performing combined thermal and natural ventilation studies using TRNSYS with COMIS and CONTAM/AIRNET.

We would welcome the opportunity to see you in Madison this winter and if you have any questions about the course, please do not hesitate to contact us!

My apologies for any cross listings...

Cheers,
	David
