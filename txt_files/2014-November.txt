Hey Jeremiah,

thank you for your reply! Any feedback about the workflow is useful to me
since I do not find many people who are trying to make the import of
geometry+materials seamless between BIM and simulation software.

My inspiration for this research was our project course at the University
of Technology in Vienna where my colleague and I tried to save our time by
using the full potential of export-import process.We had more or less the
same geometry and materials but were testing it constantly to see how the
geometry changes overall energy performance of the building. We established
which parameters should be set for the seamless import of geometry, but I
find that the most annoying thing was to assign the constructions to the
surfaces over and over again.

which one do you mean? is it additional application or the "SBT Default

totally agree here. I think it is widespread in practice. For most of the
energy engineers it is easier to rebuild the model with their own zoning.
How do you map your own material database and the given materials from an
architect?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Still cannot display eQuest 3-D rendering
Message-ID: <1415031388.81299.YahooMailNeo@web124506.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Once again, I have a new desktop computer. My old machine was a 32 bit job, 1 gB memory, and Windows xP. Unless the file was extraordinarily large, i could show the 3-D image FINE, both eQuest 3.64 or 3.65.

Now I have anew machine, Windows 7, 4 gB memory, and 64 bits. All eQuest functions work perfectly, 3.64 and 3.65 (well, maybe not so perfectly on 3.65).

But the point is I get the 2-D, but cannot get the 3-D.

I have:

1) Re-installed both programs.
2) Increased my Virtual memory 8 gB
3) Tried to remake the Windows xP environment.

Nothing has worked.

Has anyone had a graphics card issue for 64 bit machines??

Thanks.

For a C&S or similar case where an actual lighting design isn?t available to reference, citing locally enforced requirements makes sense.  Robby?s actual experience on this front strengthens my comfort level for such a scenario.

 

For cases where an actual lighting design does exist at LEED submission, I?ll voice one potential hole in this logic:  On a nationwide level, not all AHJ?s actually enforce local/state adopted energy standards/codes, and others do so only inconsistently.  USGBC can rely upon certain localities to enforce ?required? minimum performances, but not as well upon others.  

 

At least for LEED-NC, with all the existing LEED/90.1 language built on documenting and modeling the actual, proposed design (as opposed to what?s minimally required per local code or otherwise), I have doubts for a final LEED model submission USGBC would accept a statement along the lines of ?Final LPD?s will be no worse than XXX.?  Under that scenario, I?d inform/push the interested parties that your model?s final LEED results simply require the actual lighting design, if you?re being told otherwise.

 

If someone has experience to the contrary, I?d love to hear it however!

I've successfully claimed lighting energy savings for tenant improvement areas of Core & Shell projects subject to the Seattle Energy Code which would require the tenant improvements to be subject to a LPD that was more stringent than ASHRAE 90.1.  Your approach sounds reasonable.

I came across this old post regarding LEED energy modeling versus local code.

 

http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2008-October/037274.html

 

I have been searching for an answer as to whether LEED will accept the local code lighting power density allowable using the building area method using an ASHRAE 90.1-2007 baseline. The local jurisdiction adopted IECC 2012 as of July 2012 but the projects is registered under LEED 2009, using the ASHRAE 90.1-2007 baseline. Per IECC 2012 either the IECC lighting densities can be used, or there is an alternative compliance path that allows ASHRAE 90.1-2010 to be used. Both of those have a building area lighting allowance of 0.90 W/SF for an office building versus 1.0 W/SF for ASHRAE 90.1-2007.

 

Has anyone attempted to claim a lighting power reduction when the local code requires a stricter lighting density than the current LEED version being used for a project? This seems to be a reasonable justification since the proposed building will be required to meet a more strict standard than the baseline standard.

Sometimes the developer/owner might have an ?in-house code? for the tenants to build-out as well?this also might be enforced similarly to the AHJ?s, especially if the rental market is lean in that area...but should also be acceptable to USGBC.

Either way, I think the intention is there.

I can see it both ways.


1.       It?s an imperfect system to certify today based on a future action?base the certification only on the scope that is presented.

2.       By allowing such a requirement, the team can be incentivized, and more tenants will build efficiently if these requirements become incorporated to the project than if they aren?t part of the project requirements. (Even if some slip through.)

I would make one exception ? sometimes the developer is related to one or more of the major occupants, or the major occupant is known in advance. In that case, the ?tenant? should be able to hold to any known requirements?it?s not a lease taking place in the future, things are lined up already.

Think several ?named? towers that are custom-built. I don?t know that USGBC necessarily makes a distinction in this case, but it seems more solid that requirements will be passed through, as the LEED certification is probably at the tenant?s request.

For a C&S or similar case where an actual lighting design isn?t available to reference, citing locally enforced requirements makes sense.  Robby?s actual experience on this front strengthens my comfort level for such a scenario.

For cases where an actual lighting design does exist at LEED submission, I?ll voice one potential hole in this logic:  On a nationwide level, not all AHJ?s actually enforce local/state adopted energy standards/codes, and others do so only inconsistently.  USGBC can rely upon certain localities to enforce ?required? minimum performances, but not as well upon others.

At least for LEED-NC, with all the existing LEED/90.1 language built on documenting and modeling the actual, proposed design (as opposed to what?s minimally required per local code or otherwise), I have doubts for a final LEED model submission USGBC would accept a statement along the lines of ?Final LPD?s will be no worse than XXX.?  Under that scenario, I?d inform/push the interested parties that your model?s final LEED results simply require the actual lighting design, if you?re being told otherwise.

If someone has experience to the contrary, I?d love to hear it however!

I have been searching for an answer as to whether LEED will accept the local code lighting power density allowable using the building area method using an ASHRAE 90.1-2007 baseline. The local jurisdiction adopted IECC 2012 as of July 2012 but the projects is registered under LEED 2009, using the ASHRAE 90.1-2007 baseline. Per IECC 2012 either the IECC lighting densities can be used, or there is an alternative compliance path that allows ASHRAE 90.1-2010 to be used. Both of those have a building area lighting allowance of 0.90 W/SF for an office building versus 1.0 W/SF for ASHRAE 90.1-2007.

Has anyone attempted to claim a lighting power reduction when the local code requires a stricter lighting density than the current LEED version being used for a project? This seems to be a reasonable justification since the proposed building will be required to meet a more strict standard than the baseline standard.

Good morning, all,

 

LEED C&S projects have two options for dealing with future lighting systems that will be provided in future tenant improvements. Savings for future strategies may only be claimed for systems and equipment that are designed and installed as part of the C&S project unless the future tenants are required to implement particular strategies by a legal and binding document such as a Tenant Sales and/or Lease Agreement (TSLA).

 

In the scenarios described, it would seem that the TSLA may already cite the local code or developer specific requirements, or it would be a reasonable addition. For example, it is not uncommon to submit sample agreements stating that the maximum average lighting power density in future office tenant spaces is 0.9 W/sf which is 10% better than the ASHRAE 90.1-2007 minimum and if occupancy sensors are also required, further savings could be represented in the Proposed model. The requirements must be clearly defined, binding, and enforceable.

 

The specific TSLA requirements for various prerequisites sand credits can be found in CS Appendix 4 of the  LEED BD+C v2009 Reference Guide. Similar requirements apply for unfinished spaces in LEED-NC projects. These requirements are further clarified in LEED Interpretation 10102.

 

Hope this helps.

Message-ID: <1415118776.82054.YahooMailNeo@web124503.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

I have several projects coming up dealing with window film savings on large glass area buildings. I need a primer to some of the results i am seeing.

Logically, if you install window film on glass, you will reduce the cooling load in that space, but would expect the heating load to rise. This, by the way, is in the temperate So Ca climate.

In BOTH cases, my improvement with window film does a killer job in reducing cooling. But is also saves about 7% heating  !! I am going from a Shading Coefficient (SC) of 0.75 to an SC of 0.36.

Experiment. I reduced the SC to 0.01. AS boatload of cooling, but a 22% INCREASE in heating.

Then I tried a SC of 0.18.  A median between the other two runs in space cooling savings, but now virtually NO change in space heating.

Why is there a balance point in heating? System is VAV w/RH.

This BTW was double glass.

I tried another building with single glass curtain wall. SC = 0.29. 3% reduction in cooling.  Tried SC = 0.14. -1$ in heating. System is DDVAV.

Can ANYONE enlighten me as to what is going on?

I agree with Bill.  It sounds like you are losing the passive reheat of the solar gain when you decrease the shading coefficient.  We see this a lot in hospitals.

This question has been raised in the bulletin boards on several occasions, and is also 
something that I saw in a project for the Pacific Northwest about 10 years ago.

I believe the answer has to do with the HVAC sizing.  In a temperate climate, such as So 
CA, HVAC sizing is driven by the cooling load that's in turn dominated by solar gain 
through the windows.  When window film is applied, the peak cooling loads will decrease, 
resulting in smaller supply CFMs, which can also result in heating energy savings.

To expand on what Cam wrote, I would expect that USGBC would not allow lighting credit simply on the basis of the more stringent local code. LPD is a prescriptive requirement in both 90.1 2010 and IECC 2012. This means that projects may exceed the prescriptive LPDs by following performance path of compliance via 90.1 2010 Section 11 (ECB) or IECC 2012 C407.

Good morning, all,

 

LEED C&S projects have two options for dealing with future lighting systems that will be provided in future tenant improvements. Savings for future strategies may only be claimed for systems and equipment that are designed and installed as part of the C&S project unless the future tenants are required to implement particular strategies by a legal and binding document such as a Tenant Sales and/or Lease Agreement (TSLA).

 

In the scenarios described, it would seem that the TSLA may already cite the local code or developer specific requirements, or it would be a reasonable addition. For example, it is not uncommon to submit sample agreements stating that the maximum average lighting power density in future office tenant spaces is 0.9 W/sf which is 10% better than the ASHRAE 90.1-2007 minimum and if occupancy sensors are also required, further savings could be represented in the Proposed model. The requirements must be clearly defined, binding, and enforceable.

 

The specific TSLA requirements for various prerequisites sand credits can be found in CS Appendix 4 of the  LEED BD+C v2009 Reference Guide. Similar requirements apply for unfinished spaces in LEED-NC projects. These requirements are further clarified in LEED Interpretation 10102.

 

Hope this helps.

Sometimes the developer/owner might have an ?in-house code? for the tenants to build-out as well?this also might be enforced similarly to the AHJ?s, especially if the rental market is lean in that area...but should also be acceptable to USGBC.

 

Either way, I think the intention is there.

 

I can see it both ways.

 

1.       It?s an imperfect system to certify today based on a future action?base the certification only on the scope that is presented.

 

2.       By allowing such a requirement, the team can be incentivized, and more tenants will build efficiently if these requirements become incorporated to the project than if they aren?t part of the project requirements. (Even if some slip through.)

 

I would make one exception ? sometimes the developer is related to one or more of the major occupants, or the major occupant is known in advance. In that case, the ?tenant? should be able to hold to any known requirements?it?s not a lease taking place in the future, things are lined up already.

 

Think several ?named? towers that are custom-built. I don?t know that USGBC necessarily makes a distinction in this case, but it seems more solid that requirements will be passed through, as the LEED certification is probably at the tenant?s request.

For a C&S or similar case where an actual lighting design isn?t available to reference, citing locally enforced requirements makes sense.  Robby?s actual experience on this front strengthens my comfort level for such a scenario.

 

For cases where an actual lighting design does exist at LEED submission, I?ll voice one potential hole in this logic:  On a nationwide level, not all AHJ?s actually enforce local/state adopted energy standards/codes, and others do so only inconsistently.  USGBC can rely upon certain localities to enforce ?required? minimum performances, but not as well upon others.  

 

At least for LEED-NC, with all the existing LEED/90.1 language built on documenting and modeling the actual, proposed design (as opposed to what?s minimally required per local code or otherwise), I have doubts for a final LEED model submission USGBC would accept a statement along the lines of ?Final LPD?s will be no worse than XXX.?  Under that scenario, I?d inform/push the interested parties that your model?s final LEED results simply require the actual lighting design, if you?re being told otherwise.

 

If someone has experience to the contrary, I?d love to hear it however!

I've successfully claimed lighting energy savings for tenant improvement areas of Core & Shell projects subject to the Seattle Energy Code which would require the tenant improvements to be subject to a LPD that was more stringent than ASHRAE 90.1.  Your approach sounds reasonable.

I came across this old post regarding LEED energy modeling versus local code.

 

http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2008-October/037274.html

 

I have been searching for an answer as to whether LEED will accept the local code lighting power density allowable using the building area method using an ASHRAE 90.1-2007 baseline. The local jurisdiction adopted IECC 2012 as of July 2012 but the projects is registered under LEED 2009, using the ASHRAE 90.1-2007 baseline. Per IECC 2012 either the IECC lighting densities can be used, or there is an alternative compliance path that allows ASHRAE 90.1-2010 to be used. Both of those have a building area lighting allowance of 0.90 W/SF for an office building versus 1.0 W/SF for ASHRAE 90.1-2007.

 

Has anyone attempted to claim a lighting power reduction when the local code requires a stricter lighting density than the current LEED version being used for a project? This seems to be a reasonable justification since the proposed building will be required to meet a more strict standard than the baseline standard.

Hi Gang:

I have two models, one VAV, the other DDVAV. The VAV shows fan energy varying as it should (also have VFDs installed). But the DDVAV is not indicating any flow variance. I have a dual fan system installed, and all (I think) parameters are set to variable Speed.

So what parameter did I forget?

Thanks.

Dear colleagues and friends:

It is our great pleasure to announce the release of version 2.0 of umi, our urban modeling plug-in suite for Rhinoceros. With this email we are inviting you to take umi for a spin. umi 2.0 is significantly different from umi 1.0 so we encourage you to consult the updated user guide as well as a series of video tutorials<http://urbanmodellinginterface.ning.com/page/user-guide>. You can download umi from http://urbanmodellinginterface.ning.com/page/download.

[cid:image002.png at 01CFFA01.0E4A10C0]

Notable differences to version 1.0 include:

o   In addition to operational building energy use as well as walkability and bikeability, umi can now also calculate embodied energy<http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2013/p_1351.pdf> and floor area ratios (FAR).

o   Operational energy simulations use the EnergyPlus-based "shoeboxer" algorithm as presented by Dogan<http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2013/p_1123.pdf> at SimBuild 2013.

o   Non-geometric building simulation assumptions are stored in a new template format as presented by Cerezo<https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/docLib/Events/ASHRAE-IPBSA-USA/Presentations/04_Cerezo.pdf> at SimBuild 2014.

o   Umi projects are now stored in a single *.umi file which contains the Rhino scene file, the epw weather file, building modeling templates as well as all simulation results. You can export any of this data to use it separately.

o   A new results viewer allows users to analyze and export simulation results as well as to import results generated from third party simulation environments.

o   Selected umi projects can be found on the new umiverse<http://web.mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/projects/UMIverse/UMIverse.html> site.



Please share any bug reports under info at urbanmodeling.net<mailto:info at urbanmodeling.net>.

Happy simulations!

John,

I have also had models with VAV systems where the ventilation air changed rather dramatically if the peak cooling airflow changes, especially if the ventilation calculation uses the Multiple Spaces Equation from ASHRAE 62.1. If the peak airflow changes for each space while the ventilation airflow per space remains the same, the fraction of outside air for each space changes, which affects the system outside air amount.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] [DOE22] ERV,
	air side economizer and ERV-RUN-CTRL = WHEN-MIN-OA
Message-ID: <C13BE7605031E449BC5530C6B8D807E20139958EB194@HARFANG.intranet.mrn.gouv>


Context:
I'm trying to understand how DOE2.2 (EXE48r) deals with ERV plus an airside economizer on a PSZ unit (constant volume only). I've studied the economizer alone (OA-CONTROL =OA-TEMP), the ERV alone, than two others runs with both (ERV+economizer), one  with ERV-RUN-CTRL = WHEN-MIN-OA, one with ERV-RUN-CTRL = WHEN-FANS-ON.

Runs parameters :

********* 1- Econo only *********
OA-CONTROL        = OA-TEMP
DRYBULB-LIMIT     = 68
MAX-OA-FRACTION   = 0.8
ECONO-LOCKOUT     = NO
**************************

********* 2- ERV Only **********
OA-CONTROL         = FIXED

RECOVER-EXHAUST   = YES
ERV-RECOVER-TYPE  = SENSIBLE-WHEEL
ERV-SENSIBLE-EFF  = 0.6
ERV-RUN-CTRL      = WHEN-FANS-ON
***************************

*********** 3- Both (WHEN-FANS-ON) ******
OA-CONTROL        = OA-TEMP
DRYBULB-LIMIT     = 68
MAX-OA-FRACTION   = 0.8
ECONO-LOCKOUT     = NO

RECOVER-EXHAUST   = YES
ERV-RECOVER-TYPE  = SENSIBLE-WHEEL
ERV-SENSIBLE-EFF  = 0.6
ERV-RUN-CTRL      = WHEN-FANS-ON
*****************************************

*********** 4- Both (WHEN-MIN-OA) ******
OA-CONTROL        = OA-TEMP
DRYBULB-LIMIT     = 68
MAX-OA-FRACTION   = 0.8
ECONO-LOCKOUT     = NO

RECOVER-EXHAUST   = YES
ERV-RECOVER-TYPE  = SENSIBLE-WHEEL
ERV-SENSIBLE-EFF  = 0.6
ERV-RUN-CTRL      = WHEN-MIN-OA
**************************************

Results:

The WHEN-FANS-ON strategy (ERV + economizer) has the same cooling hours load that the ERV alone, but a little lower annual cooling energy (-2%).
With the WHEN-MIN-OA strategy : same cooling hours load, but a lower annual cooling energy (-21%). The 21% reduction in cooling energy compare to the 2% means the economizer plays an important role in the WHEN-MIN-OA strategy. On the other side, the runs have the same cooling hours when there is an EVR (no matter the control strategies). So with WHEN-MIN-OA, the ERV doesn't seems to stop when the economizer is active (which is not what the dictionary says)...

note : annual OFF hours not represented. Runs make with a PSZ, Constant Volume, 56% OA fraction, Montr?al


Question 1)

Q: In a AHU with an ERV and an economizer, can we consider that the economizer "Outside air" become the heat exchanger outlet air (in the FORTRAN code above, "DBT" would become the heat exchanger outlet air temperature )?


Question 2)
In the dictionary we can read that, ERV-RUN-CTRL = WHEN-MIN-OA means that the ERV operates only when the outside air dampers are at their minimum position (i.e., the economizer is inactive). In other hand, in the file SYS.LIS we can read that:
***********************************************************

        CASE (2)  ! When OA at minimum                                          ERVnt  156

************************************************************
with :
OAfrac   Fraction of supply flow thru ERV and economizer
OAerv    Fraction of supply flow thru ERV only

Q: Considering MIN-OA-METHOD = FRACTION-OF-DESIGN, does the "OAerv" variable mean the design minimum OA fraction ?

Question 3)
A last one question more macro about the ERV-RUN-CTRL = WHEN-MIN-OA strategy:
Because with ERV-RUN-CTRL = WHEN-MIN-OA, the ERV stop when the economizer is active (that what is says in the dictionary);
because the economizer is active when outside air dampers are NOT at their minimum position (inlet economiser air temperature < return air );
because the inlet economizer is the outlet heat exchanger (I'm not sure with DOE2, but this is what the reality is)

Q: does DOE22 select what would be the best choice for the mixed air temperature between these two configurations:
the ERV is active with economizer inactive (outside air dampers at their minimum position) ;
the ERV is inactive with economizer active (outside air dampers position to maximize the mixed air temperature) ?

Hi Nick,

We?ve used 10% as a standard proportion for meeting/conference spaces in a C&S office for LEED previously with no issues. We?ve had comments specifically targeting this as a requirement for 62.1 calculations in C&S buildings when you have a multi-zone VAV system ? or any other system where the fresh air is a variable proportion of the conditioned air. We produced a notional floor plan suggesting how it could be zoned, although the level of detail used was minimal. This seems sensible given that the building upon fit-out will have a variety of space types, which will usually follow a relatively predictable layout and the design should be capable of coping with this.

Hope that helps,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Core and Shell Office Buildings: Do you model conference rooms

All,

For a C&S office building, it seems there are no hard rules on how to handle conference rooms. My approach is to use a percentage of total office area 10-15%, as this gives realistic ventilation rates as well as internal people gains.

As is typical of highly ventilated interior zones, I may be seeing a penalty associated with modeling conference space in this way.

Any thoughts are appreciated.

Nick

Modeling and Calibrating Radiant Systems in OpenStudio
   [cid:image001.jpg at 01CFFF3B.A0CD34B0]

Target Audience: Engineers, Architects, & Simulationists - CEU/PDHs AVAILABLE for in-person attendees!

Date and Time: November 19, 2014 - 12.00 to 13.00 MT

Location: UI - IDL Classroom - 306 S 6th St. Boise, ID

Registration: Remote Webinar<https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/2554051524569445377> or Live Presentation<http://goo.gl/forms/4LsCjN0RXE>*
*(in-person attendees will receive a FREE LUNCH if registered by noon the day prior to the event)

Description:
In this lecture, Damon Woods will discuss using OpenStudio to model radiant HVAC systems and leveraging its Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT) capabilities for calibration.  Developing and calibrating a model for a building with a complex HVAC system can be a significant challenge for architects and engineers alike.  However, new versions of OpenStudio are making this process easier.
This presentation will include a demonstration of setting up a simple building model with a radiant slab in OpenStudio.  Once constructed, the model can be adjusted in hundreds of ways very quickly by using the Parametric Analysis Tool that is now available.  For existing projects, the building's actual consumption data can be imported to OpenStudio so that the effects of the parametric adjustments on the model can be contrasted against the building's actual behavior.  This can save significant time and energy during the calibration process.
Learning Objectives:

1.       Construct a radiant HVAC system in OpenStudio.

2.       Use OpenStudio's Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT).

3.       Import a building's utility data into OpenStudio.

4.       Combine the utility data with OpenStudio's PAT to quickly calibrate a model.
Bio:
Damon Woods is a PhD student at the University of Idaho.  He is studying mechanical engineering with a focus on increasing the energy efficiency of buildings by using modeling and predictive control of radiant systems.   Damon received his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Montana State University in 2006 with minors in Aerospace and English Literature.  He graduated with a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Boise State University in 2013, and is now working as a research assistant at U of I's Integrated Design Lab while pursuing his doctorate.

Thanks Edwin.

FYI, I took out all conference spaces and made them open office to test the effect. While the ventilation rates and total energy consumption decreased as would be expected, the percent energy cost savings was not affected appreciably.

I am seeing a -0.2% decrease in energy cost savings between the 10% conference model and the 0% conference model. So I do not think that conference spaces affect the savings ?C assuming VAV min turndown not causing excessive reheat in these zones.

Hi Nick,

We??ve used 10% as a standard proportion for meeting/conference spaces in a C&S office for LEED previously with no issues. We??ve had comments specifically targeting this as a requirement for 62.1 calculations in C&S buildings when you have a multi-zone VAV system ?C or any other system where the fresh air is a variable proportion of the conditioned air. We produced a notional floor plan suggesting how it could be zoned, although the level of detail used was minimal. This seems sensible given that the building upon fit-out will have a variety of space types, which will usually follow a relatively predictable layout and the design should be capable of coping with this.

Hope that helps,

For the 62MZCalc form I typically break down the spaces to include the perimeter offices being the area within 15?? of the exterior, an elevator lobby (maybe 200 sf), 10% conference, 10% corridor, and the remainder being the interior office space. Never had an issue on an office building having to explain that logic.

Since the baseline has to match the proposed model outside air, if you are over the ASHRAE minimum it shouldn??t impact the savings much at all by using a different breakdown of areas.

Message-ID: <1415989416.72642.YahooMailNeo@web124502.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

HATE when this happens.

I am reviewing a building that has several floors. The owner wants a window evaluation for new windows on the lower floors. These windows are LARGER than the existing windows.

So I deftly came up with the base Wizard model. Ran fine.

Then I created a copy, calling it Modified Windows. I changed the window dimensions (and count) using the Custom Window Design. In saving it, I got an "unknown error" message.

Any one ever have this happen?

Chris - Here is some insight from a comparable situation, although the system types are different:

Three C&S office buildings that I've modeled have energy recovery ventilators (ERV-located on the roof) that use gas for heating. The terminal units throughout the building contain electric heating coils. The gas heating coil in the ERV is intended to be used in the following scenarios:


1)      The energy wheel goes down

2)      To keep the ERV discharge air temperature above 32F (heat air so the discharge is a minimum of 40F for freeze protection purposes)

For simulation purposes, I have found that, given the high efficiencies of the energy wheel and given the TMY3 weather data, the gas energy consumption is either not engaged at all or is sufficiently small compared to the electric energy consumption (<10% of total heating energy consumption).

For this reason, I have been able to justify going with System 4 or System 8. The energy savings of the proposed building when compared to the gas/electric hybrid baseline building is much less than the all-electric baseline building.

Christopher,

I assume your building is non-residential. If that is the case the baseline system for a non-residential building with 9 floors must be System 7 or 8. Since the proposed building is gas/electric hybrid, that drives the baseline to system 7. Based on G3.1.3.2 your boiler will be fossil fuel. Systems qualifying for the exception under G3.1.1b should use the same heating source as the main system, so that means System 3.

Mike

Hi Chris,

1. >5 floors should be system 7 with hybrid heating source?
2. The selection of system for those special spaces in the building is
based on the heating source for the main building (Please see user's manual
p. G-28 for details). That's why you pick up system 3 which should be
fossil fuel furnace. You can not use predominate heating source here.

Cheney,
A previous post from 2011 stated that the LEED reviewer provided the following comment:


?Section 1.1.A of the form indicates that the primary heating source is fossil
fuel. However, the electric heating energy use reported in Table EAp2-5 for the
Proposed Case exceeds the fossil fuel heating energy use. Please verify that the
correct heating source has been selected. If electric heating is the primary
heating source, please change the Baseline system type accordingly. Provide
updated simulation results and a revised Prerequisite Form as necessary.?

That is why I selected System 7 with an electric boiler (the predominate heating source is electric).

Should I not also selecte System 3 with electric heat for the special spaces even though the User Manual suggests fossil furnace?

Researcher and one Postdoctoral Scholar to be appointed at the University
of California Berkeley.


One of the candidates will work within the Center for the Built
Environment. CBE?s mission is ?to improve the environmental quality and
energy efficiency of buildings by providing timely, unbiased information on
building technologies and design and operation techniques.? We are
recruiting candidates to work on issues related to our Advanced Integrated
Systems research program, which will focus primarily on radiant systems
over the coming years.



One of the candidates will work within SinBerBEST. SinBerBEST is a large
joint research project between UC Berkeley, National University of
Singapore, and Nanyang Technological University. This effort aims to
improve energy efficiency and sustainability in buildings in tropical
climates. We are recruiting candidates for Thrust 4: Human-Building
Interactions and the Environment. Thrust 4?s mission is ?to acquire
information, create knowledge, and convey understanding to ensure that
indoor environmental quality provided for building occupants is maintained
or improved while energy efficiency gains are achieved.?



I've attached an advertisement describing the two positions.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Understanding ASHRAE Climate Classification
Message-ID: <CAJdG7BCj0K8Ok=VvU_vo6iOgy=yA5Hd6C2v9O0arAJtqko-Edw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I am not sure this is the right forum to ask this type of queries. In the
ASHRAE climate classification, the climate zone (1 to 8) are based on CDD
and HDD on base temperature 10 deg C and 18.3 deg C respectively. In the
literature, the 18 deg C as base temperatures for both CDD and HDD have
been used for different classification systems around the world.

My question is regarding to methodology of defining base temperatures for
heating and cooling need of the building.

1. How ASHRAE arrived on base temperature of 10 deg C for CDD?
2. For classification of international cities should it be different?

Any help and guidance will be appreciated.

Thank you.

Regards,
Mayank Bhatnagar

Thank you to all who tried helping me.
It WAS indeed the graphics card. The computer store installed a more graphics friendly one, and the 3-D image now appear.

I think you have to manually assign a capacity. For some reason eQUEST doesn?t autosize baseboards, if I recall. Usually I use a formula based on zonal square footage.

Know I am missing something.

I have 4 floors of electric baseboards in New York City building. I have the rating blank and the CTRL on Thermostatic. It says if there is any heating, the baseboards should come on 1st. There IS heating, but no baseboards.

Help?

John,

You would need to enter in the capacity of the baseboards for them to kick on.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Unable to create windows in sketchup using OS plugin and
	Plugin error
Message-ID: <CAPgg=ysjJhUAA95K0pWhSSkbsGN1z6Q_+ihS3TZfnQsQUEq+bQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to create windows on a 5 storey building. I am not using the
WWR tool but manually inserting windows by creating rectangle of same
dimension and then using "project loose geometry" tool. however over some
surfaces I am facing problems that the windows are not being created. Apart
from this I have certain obsercvations as follows:

1) Over some surface I have to mention Length first followed by height, for
eg 4,5 where 4 is length and5 is height, and on some surfaces it should be
vice versa.

2) I am creating a rectangle of dimension of window and then pasting it on
all the surfaces which have similar window size. when i project these loose
geometry then not all windows are created. I observed that all the surfaces
where the length, breath format of mentioning dimension gets reversed the
windows are not project. Why is this happening??

3) As it is quite big building, after adding certain number of windows an
error occurs after which the OS plugin disappears and building appears in
wireframe. after this now windows can be added and no editing of model is
effective any more. I am attaching the error as pictures. !st pic shows the
error other shows the building how it looks after error.

4) While creating windows using WWR method such errors were never seen, is
it some problem while creating individual windows? and how to go about it
as having uniform window length using WWR method would not give right
representation of building, as different rooms have different windows sizes
& over hangs depending upon their orientation.

5) Also by mistake I deleted a wall, fortunately i didn't save it so was
able to get it back, but is there any way to just create a wall in already
built model?


Best,
Sanket

I have a glassy office building in SoCal. Report LS-C says the envelop contributes 770 tons to the load. peak tons show 1920 when it is 98 DEgF outside. This implies the rest of the tonnage is Outside Air.
I have reduced the OSA at the zone level from 20 CFM/person to 5 CFM/person.
Absolutely NO reduction on the peak load.
What am I missing?

Dear All,
               I am analyzing a rectangular building with each and west
facades structured glazed and forming longer sides of rectangle  and i
shaded these facades with louvers (shading device)

I compared the annual heat gains of two case1 building with no shading case
2 building with shading(louvers) what i found was there is considerable
reduction in annual solar gains in building but the annual external
conduction gains in building have increased after shading i am unable to
understand this.

Any one who can share his ideas on this.


Warm Regards
Sambhav Tiwari

The VE doesn?t model thermal bridging, so that isn?t it.  What climate is your building in?  What percentage glazing are the east and west walls?  Are you losing heat through the envelope or gaining it?  It could have to do with the shades blocking more sun from heating up the outside of the envelope on those walls, which then changes the delta T and resulting conduction gain.

Hi Sambhav,

Yeah - I'd agree with Cory - you probably have a higher glazing surface
temperature with the unshaded model and I wouldn't be surprised if that is
part of the conduction equation, meaning you are less likely to gain heat
through conduction if the glazing is in full sun.

cheers,

Andrew

Hi Sambhav,

You can send any question into support at iesve.com<mailto:support at iesve.com> if you?re looking for help with understanding this.  They?ll be able to take a detailed look at your model and help you set the model up correctly for what you?re trying to study.

Assuming you?ve modelled the shades as local shade and not a room, then you won?t see any impact of a ?thermal bridge?.  However, if you modelled the shades (fins) as rooms, then you would see a ?thermal bridge? ? especially since the default construction that would be assigned the point where the two ?rooms? meet would be an interior partition made up of nothing but two pieces of gypsum board with an air gap between then.

This question has come up recently with regard to a project that has many non-thermally broken vertical fins in CZ6.

Dear Colleagues,

We are seeking interested collaborators for a two-year postdoctoral  
position in an area related to (day)lighting and visual comfort. Ideal  
candidates should have experience in various lighting simulation programs  
and programming as well as fundamental knowledge of related areas such as  
photometric measurements and human subject research. The SUTD-MIT  
Postdoctoral Programme (SUTD-MIT PDP) offers a chance to perform research  
for one year at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)  
in Singapore and a second year at MIT in Cambridge, MA USA.

This is a unique position as it involves working with two advisers in  
separate research labs between the two universities. J. Alstan Jakubiec  
 from SUTD and Christoph Reinhart from MIT will be involved as advisors. If  
you or a recently graduated student are interested in this opportunity,  
please e-mail us your CV and a brief idea of your research interests so we  
may begin a conversation.

SUTD-MIT PDP fellows receive a full stipend with allowance for conference  
travel and have a small teaching requirement for one semester per year.  
More details about the SUTD-MIT PDP  are available online at  
http://www.sutd.edu.sg/mit_sutd_pdp.aspx or via e-mail inquiry to Alstan  
at john_jakubiec at sutd.edu.sg. Application deadlines are 1 Jan 2015 and 1  
Mar 2015 for starting dates in July or September respectively.

Sincerely,

Sambhav,

What do you mean when you say that the conduction gains have increased?  
Do you mean that there's less conduction heat flow entering the 
building, or more ?  If it's the former, that makes a lot of sense, 
since the shading is cutting off solar gain on the wall/window, thus 
lowering its surface temperature (or more exactly, sol-air temperature) 
and reducing heat flow into the building.  If it's the latter, that 
would be problematic, since I don't see how reducing solar gain would 
increase conduction heat flow entering the building.

TITLE 24 2013 NON-RESIDENTIAL PERFORMANCE MODELING

When: Tuesday, December 2, 2014 at 6:00pm
Location: Interface Engineering Inc, 717 Market St. San Francisco, CA 94103
SCHEDULE:
6 pm to 6:30 pm, Networking

WEBINAR REGISTRATION DETAILS:

NO WEBINAR - THIS IS AN IN-PERSON EVENT
For our November meeting we are a little behind the ball and will be gathering on December 2nd! Please join us for a conversation and collaborative discussion about Title 24 2013 non-residential performance modeling in practice, what is working, failures, workarounds and lessons learned. Topics will range from the requirement to achieve 10% over Title 24 2013 for LEED Midrise or GreenPoint Rated to the new software programs CBECC-COM and IES.
Anna Osborne from Interface Engineering has graciously offered to host and put forward this topic. She will help introduce the discussion and we hope to make this an open dialog between attendees. So please bring your knowledge and ideas. As a community of engaged practitioners, we can be a powerful voice to recommend steps the CEC should consider and implement to make all our lives easier.
This is an In-person event and so please RSVP Anna Osborne at annao at interfaceeng.com<mailto:annao at interfaceeng.com> for attending.
Thanks and wish you all a very Happy Thanksgiving break.
Jude.
