Hi Sambhav

AppendixG ASHRAE 90.1- 2004: states to model base case ,if roof is present with insulation on above deck only.only need put in a simple U-value for the Specification method?. You then create your actual construction in your Proposed case.

This is to avoid "Attic effect"?.Insulation on inside of roof creates attic effect.

Hi,

As per Table G3.1 of ASHRAE 90.1- 2004:"Opaque assemblies used for new buildings or additions shall conform with the following common,lightweight assembly types and shall match the appropriate assembly maximum U-factors in Tables 5.5-1 through 5.5-8"
As the code mentioned all the constructions to be lightweight assemblies, my guess is, that only insulation is to be modeled. I hope somebody can throw some more light on this.

Surekha Tetali

Debra,

 

I haven?t heard of any that are certified, and your question is the first I have heard of any wanting to be certified.  I guess I am not being very helpful, but I am very interested in this subject too.  I have wondered if it is even possible for one to become certified given that the building contains a electric power station.

 

For that matter, could an industrial plant be certified?

Message-ID: <c53178e80909012105g52cc9b6eua3e1d105b94fe81a@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I modeled a building according to the dimensions from the CAD drawings.
There are some cut outs in the ceilings that connect two zones from ground
floor to the roof. When I exported the data to excel, the total area of the
building is much larger than the actual area of the building. The perimeter
dimensions are good, but the internal zones seem to have a large area. Could
you please explain how is the area calculated for connected zones ?



Please find attached a screen shot of the same model in question.   The
ceiling of Ground floor has 3 sub ?elements. I don?t understand how two
ceiling elements and how all 3 elements have a separate area allocation.

 Would highly appreciate your comments on the same.



Thank you,

Deepa Chandrashekaran

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Appendix G Pump power limitation
Message-ID: <415371.95707.qm@web111819.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Friends,
???????? We are simulating a 63 floor (900 ft tall) building with campus chilled water using the performance rating method for?LEED. We are following the directions of "Required treatment of district thermal energy" guidelines.

One of the requirements of Appendix G is to limit the pumping power to 22 W/GPM. This gives us a head of about 85 ft based on a 72% combined motor-mechanical efficiency. 

If the building used onsite chillers, the W/GPM limitation is probably justified considering we could locate chillers on mechanical floors at different levels and limit the pump head. However I am not sure if this limit is justified?for campus chilled water where the water needs to be pumped from bottom up.

I found this post in the archive which seems to address this issue
http://lists.onebuilding.org/htdig.cgi/bldg-sim-onebuilding.org/2003-December/001349.html

Can anyone please comment on their experience of this situation.
?
thanks,
raj

I have a model that has been crashing a lot but I can't track down why.  One time it could happen after changing a fan schedule by an hour, another time by adding baseboard capacities (or even changing capacities - 1,000 works, 2,000 crashes), or adding OA CFM to a zone (but adding OA/Person works fine provided its 18 not 16), or about a dozen other changes that I've noticed.  Typically it crashes around 18% or 34% simulation progress.  No errors show up in the sim file or elsewhere but it does create a large (66,888 kb) file called "FOR003" that is unreadable.  Any thoughts?  Has anyone run into this before?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Sketchup <--> Demeter Feedback/Experience
Message-ID: <FCEBC0C28321F7479789B25A13030F69CED33E@sandbinc2.sbi.smithboucher.com>

Hello Dr. Finlayson,

 

For whatever reason, I'm having a lot of difficulty searching for
answers to my Demeter inquries through google sketchup groups / bldg-sim
archives / Demeter forums (are they even up?)... and it occurred to me
there simply might not be much discussion out there to look for!  This
email should go a long way to remedy that!

 

I have some feedback  for your team in the form of constructive
criticism and issues I've had, along with a few related questions.
Overall, I really like what I see so far, though I understand the
project is still under development (the current version hosted on the
website is 0.8.9.2, for anyone following along).  I'll throw out that my
feedback is colored from the perspective I've gained after some
successful experiences working with the free plugin from IES, which ties
into their commercial energy modeling software packages in much the same
way that Demeter is tied to Green Building Studio.  

 

I'm also copying this feedback to the [bldg-sim] mailing list to spark
some further Demeter discussion/feedback and to request other end-users'
workarounds/experiences for our collective benefit.  It's my hope that
the IES VE-Ware sketchup plugin development team will also review these
points as both tools have some key things to learn from each other...
Any responses you've got addressing these points would be good to post
on [bldg-sim] as well, I'd imagine.

 

Feedback/Issues encountered:

 

+             As you may be well aware, one cannot have the IES Sketchup
plugin and the Demeter plugin installed at the same time without
sketchup crashing at every startup.  While one might speculate that you
two development teams might want that, being "competing" products (?), I
think it would be appropriate to recognize that users like myself who
might wish to explore Demeter/GBS vs. IES/IES-VEWare get annoyed when we
have to uninstall/reinstall software to do our jobs.  Ideally I'd like
both installed at the moment anyway - see my next point...

 

+             Something to note:  There is a real and interesting
contrast in the manner of defining spaces between the IES and Demeter
plugin.  Demeter's capability to "check contiguity" for enclosed
volumes, and to highlight planes that are out-of-whack for ease in
correcting the issue is wonderful.  The IES plugin's approach of "find
spaces" on the other hand is MUCH less tedious than having to manually
select every plane enclosing a space, without an opportunity to correct
one's selection if you accidentally miss or include a stray plane.
Ideally, I think both plugins ought to learn from each other and create
a "find spaces" command that, perhaps with an option ticked, might
perform that function while additionally subsequently highlighting any
and all non-contiguous planes to the defined volumes.  Wouldn't life be
grand? =)

 

+             The cube user interface is altogether nifty and
functional.  One major improvement however, for those of us without
large displays (Mine runs at 1280x1024), would be to have the option to
have the interface "auto-hide" until one mouses-over the top of the
window.  As it is the model interface window uses up half of my working
space, making it kinda difficult to manipulate my model views to
correctly select/de-select faces for defining the spaces.

 

+             I cannot get the "energy analyse" cube-face to operate
correctly with GBS.  It gives me an error consistently telling me
"Webserver Logon Failed."  Any thoughts?

 

+             (Nitpick) Whenever I export an xml file using the
interface or plugin drop-down feature, the resulting file has no
extension.  Adding .xml however allows GBS desktop to recognize the file
for importing.

 

+             (Nitpick) The installer I have tries by default to install
to a Google Sketchup 6 directory.  I'm using version 7 (this may be the
root of some of my other issues).  It'd be nice/convenient if the
installer could figure that out on its own what is the appropriate
directory.

 

+             Once the exported .xml file is selected in the appropriate
GBS desktop field, I cannot successfully complete a run.  Trying to view
the model in VRML results in an error reading "geometry is not a field
of Material."  I suspect incompatible versions of sketchup/GBS/Demeter
is the root of this issue...?

 

+             Back to the UI:  The "Space Definition" face of the cube
has three buttons whose function I have not been able to figure out, nor
find documentation explaining their purpose.  Plane Up / Plane Down /
Plane Tool.  If they are intended to be some alternative to manually
selecting each face of a volume, that would be a step in the right
direction for ease of use (see above).

 

+             Regarding the "Surface Definition" face of the cube...
here I have to get more critical.  The first model I tried this out on
has something like 600+ faces.  Your interface does not allow one to
define more than one face at a time.  One should be able to first select
and change an entire space's face properties as a group, and
subsequently be able to select multiple faces at a time to change their
properties.  I hate to sound partial to IES but it sure is nice that the
IES plugin figures out what is a floor vs. a roof vs. an
interior/exterior wall automatically (though to what degree of accuracy
I've not ascertained)...  Something that both automatically guesses
(with some accuracy) surface definitions, while allowing the end-user to
easily review and edit those properties would be ideal for both plugins.

 

+             While I obviously am having trouble getting GBS to play
nicely with Demeter, I'm very hopeful that a successfully created .inp
file from GBS, originating from a Sketchup/Demeter model, will correctly
and accurately be importable into eQuest, where a good number of us
energy modelers get a lot of "post-preliminary-design-stage" work done.
That would bridge a long-desired path I've had regarding establishing a
workflow from Sketchup --> eQuest.  Previous mailing list postings have
indicated this is a possibility, but as it stands with whatever
combination of compatibility/end-user (me) issues exist, I've yet to see
this pull through with my own eyes.  I hope GBS's ties with Autodesk's
Ecotect product won't impair this possibility in the future.

 

+             On that note, could you clarify for myself and others the
relationship that exists between the development teams for Demeter
(Green Space Research) Green Building Studio, and Autodesk's Ecotect
software?  To what extent might the goals of one group
influence/restrict the others?

 

+             Is there a mailing list one can join to be notified
if/when new versions of Demeter are developed?

 

I hope this feedback is useful to many, and would encourage other users
of Sketchup/Demeter/IES/GBS to chime in with their thoughts and
experiences!

I am currently working on performing an Energy Model for a Hospital
addition that will be credited under LEED-NC. The project includes a
renovation of third and forth floors (LEED-CI) and construction of a new
fifth floor and mechanical equipment room that will serve all three
floors. I am having trouble determining an approach for modeling the
EAc1 mechanical systems for the isolated fifth floor model and

assortment of existing hydronic systems throughout the hospital. I
understand this is quite vague but any guidance will be greatly
appreciated.

(Got no responses from eQuest users list, reposting here)

I'm designing an unconditioned building with a thermal mass / night precooling strategy, and I'm using hourly reports of the zone temp to evaluate different mass strategies.

However, there are at least three hourly reports that are potentially relevant to this:

-        Current hour zone temp

-        Trial zone temp

-        The average temp during this hour

Can anyone on the list tell me what the differences are between these values and how they are computed?  Which is going to best represent the occupant's experience of the zone conditions?

Thanks

(Got no responses from eQuest users list, reposting here)

I'm using eQuest to design a building that uses unconditioned air for ventilation and performs night-time precooling of the thermal mass walls and floor slab.

I've defined all my wall materials as layers, and am generally getting sensible results to my parametric runs with varying amounts of mass in the walls.  I'm primarily looking at the indoor temperatures ("current hour zone temp") with hourly reports, and binning them by the number of comfortable and uncomfortable hours.

However, I am having trouble figuring out how much air I need to push through at night to fully charge the thermal mass.  I've been inferring mass temperature based on the response of the air temperature, but I was hoping to be able to look at mass temperature directly.

Is there any kind of hourly report or other way to find out the temperatures in the walls and/or floor mass?

Thanks

Another question related to my thermal mass passive cooling project:  Part of this project is to use ceiling fans for comfort cooling during the day.  We also are considering using the ceiling fans (under EMS control) to run at night to improve the efficiency of the heat transfer to walls during the precooling phase.

It seems like the easiest way to simulate this would be to adjust the inside film resistance downward during the times the ceiling fans are running.  To wit:

1)      Is there any way to vary the inside film resistance e.g. on a schedule?

2)      Does anyone have a sense of the relationship between inside film resistance and air velocity, to establish a good value for the times that the fans are running?  We're expecting air velocities of ~100-200 FPM near the walls.

3)      Can anyone think of a different approach to simulating this effect, other than manipulating the inside film resistance values?

Thanks, once again.

Brent,

This was something I looked at about 15 years ago in a LBNL project for
the California Institute for Energy Efficiency to design a 
compressorless house for California transition climates, using the 
DOE-2.1E program. There was a paper that I wrote with Fred Winkelmann 
called "the Story of h", that I believe got turned into an LBNL report, 
circa 1993. Since eQUEST uses the same modeling as DOE-2.1E,
what I found should also apply.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to vary the inside air film coefficient
in DOE-2, since it is used in calculating the response factor of each 
layer, and ultimately in the weighting factor of each space. Making the
response factora changeable during a simulation would require major 
mathematical surgery of the room model used in DOE-2 and possibly 
invalidate the whole weighting factor approach.

What I did do, which was not very satisfactory, was to do multiple runs
varying the h (inside air film coefficient) in order to bound the 
effect. I based the value of h depending on the air flow rate on work
done by Jeff Spitler at Oklahoma State University on an ASHRAE project,
but I don't recall the exact values.  I do recall that beyond a certain 
amount of air changes, ~ 20 ?, there was little change in h.

I shall be obliged if any one of you can see and answer this problem
and i am also sending you my equest file.


Also if any one can tell when to use night controlled ventilation and
natural ventilation in air side h vac tab.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] modelling dry-cycling behaviour of boilers
Message-ID: <3114D6DE890F4E728BD63984CC204E5D@ZED.local>

Dear all,
 
Calibrated energy modelling for existing building stock is on the increase.
Therefore, it seems that thermal modelling does need to evolve model
"mis-behaviour" of HVAC systems. Dry cycling - the firing of the burner just
to maintain boiler heat exchanger temperature even when there is no demand -
is one such type of "mis-behaviour".
 
I'm just curious to see if anybody has modelled this or similar situations
and what software was used... 
 
Perhaps I should re-direct to the Trnsys user forum!

	SketchUp plugin)

Greenspace, developers of the Demeter SketchUp plugin and the LiveEPC  
SBEM front-end, are making available a new, integrated, suite of  
energy analysis tools as a free (time-limited) alpha release.

The Greenspace Live suite is made up of 4 tools:

The latest version of the Demeter SketchUp plugin, now called  
LiveEnergy Modeller. This enables buildings created in SketchUp to be  
intelligently zoned and exported in gbXML format. It also enables  
gbXML files created in other applications to be imported into  
SketchUp. (If any members of this mailing list have seen the email  
posted on the 2nd of September by Nick Caton then look out for a  
direct reply to him by one of my colleagues which gives more  
information on how this alpha2 release of the plugin differs from the  
earlier 'Demeter' one.)

The latest version of LiveEPC, now called LiveEnergy EPC. This is a  
front-end to the SBEM energy simulation program (extensively used in  
the UK) and can produce (non-DSM) energy analysis as well as checking  
UK building regulations and producing an Energy Performance  
Certificate. LiveEnergy EPC is not a modeller -- it imports gbXML from  
LiveEnergy Modeller (or any other gbXML source). Whilst it is a  
desktop application, the energy analysis actually takes place on a  
server (which is where all files reside also). This means your files  
and reports are visible anywhere in the world where there is internet  
access.

To better leverage this web-based approach, we've created a powerful  
browser-based viewing application called LiveEnergy Dashboard which  
incorporates sophisticated graphing tools.

Finally, we'd like to introduce LiveEnergy Workspace, a web-based  
project management framework and filestore that lets you make the most  
of the collaboration the web is supposed to make easy.

We would like to make clear that we consider the suite as a whole to  
be at an "alpha" level of readiness (although some parts of it are  
more mature than others). Which means that, whilst we have made every  
effort to make sure it will work correctly, you should not use it in a  
production environment.

The entire suite (and supporting website) is available to use free-of- 
charge for the lifetime of this alpha release, which is until the 31st  
of October 2009.

If you are interested then please visit www.greenspacelive.com for  
more information (including some video tutorials) and a chance to sign  
up for the software tools.

References: 00000C36
Message-ID: <4AA0F8BD.4090404@lews.uhi.ac.uk>

Hello Mr Caton and all on the BLDG-Sim mailing list,

Thanks for your feedback and suggestions regarding the Demeter tool and 
thanks for your continued use of the tool.

As my colleague Donald I Macdonald posted on the Bldg-Sim mailing list 
yesterday, we have now released a new version of our SketchUp plugin now 
called LiveEnergy as part of our Greenspace Live suite. The currently 
released version of the LiveEnergy is entitled LiveEnergy Modeller and 
allows for the import and export of gbXML files from Google SketchUp, 
which can then be used in a variety of tools such as our own LiveEnergy 
EPC tool and other energy analysis software. LiveEnergy Modeller does 
not currently have GBS enabled directly from the interface, but this is 
something we may introduce at a later date, we are also working on a 
version to work with TRNSYS (for more details see the paper recently 
presented at the Building Simulation 2009 conference: 
http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_1389_1396.pdf).

We have also released training materials (including tutorial videos) on 
our website, and have set up a new discussion forum. These can all be 
accessed on our website at: *http://greenspacelive.com* where the tools 
can also be downloaded.

I will now address some of the feedback / issues highlighted in your email.

    * *Compatibility with other SketchUp plugins:* We have made some
      efforts in this latest version of the plugin to package the
      codebase more effectively, so that we shouldn't have as many
      issues with incompatibilites with other plugins. However, we would
      be grateful if any compatibility issues arising with other plugins
      could be reported on our forum so that we can be aware of them.
      There is also now an option to disable LiveEnergy Modeller from
      the Google Extensions manager (in the settings window) without
      uninstalling the plugin.
    * *Space Selection:* We have now introduced a "semi-automatic"
      method of selecting spaces. You can now use our "Select Space"
      tool to simply click on the floor surface of each space and then
      the enclosing walls should be automatically selected. Spaces are
      then confirmed by pressing the "Confirm Space" button. This also
      allows you to manually select which surfaces go into the space so
      that the user still has the same level of control as before. A
      "Find Spaces" command is an interesting idea and something we may
      include in a future version.
    * *Cube Interface Size:* Our new LiveEnergy interface has been
      cleaned up, and is no longer a 3D cube. The interface is also much
      smaller by default, but can be maximised when you need to get into
      the detailed user interface / construction libraries etc. Much of
      the emphasis when building a model is now on using SketchUp
      materials and tools to create the energy model, and not so much in
      the LiveEnergy interface.
    * *GBS Operation:* GBS operation has been disabled in this current
      version of LiveEnergy. The reason why it will no longer work with
      Demeter, is that the URLs for GBS have changed to Autodesk ones.
      We have not updated Demeter to account for this, as we have been
      concentrating on developing the new LiveEnergy Modeller.
    * *XML File Extension:  *This is has proved to be a challenge due to
      the SketchUp api, but is something we will develop.
    * *Installer Defaults to SketchUp 6:* The LiveEnergy installer now
      defaults to SketchUp 7.
    * *Geometry Problems in the gbXML:* The gbXML creation should now be
      significantly improved.
    * *Plane Up / Plane Down etc:* These options were designed to raise
      and lower the active section plane when assigning spaces to the
      internal surfaces etc. This has now been replaced by a single tool
      "Move Plane" that allows you to move the active plane up and down
      using the mouse without deselecting surfaces. The "Space
      Definition" window is no more (although there is a list of spaces
      in the "Building Envelope" window).
    * *Surface Definition:* This has now been replaced by a new system
      using the SketchUp materials pallette that we think is more
      intuitive and should be more familiar to SketchUp users - you now
      "paint" the surface type onto each surface. As a way of
      automatically doing this is something we can look into for a
      future version.

News and updates about our tools as well as support information etc can 
all be found on our new website at http://greenspacelive.com

All our tools are currently at an "alpha" stage of development, and are 
currently all available free of charge on this basis until the 31st of 
October 2009. Anyone can now sign up to our website and get access to 
our whole suite including LiveEnergy Modeller and LiveEnergy EPC. We 
would greatly appreciate your feedback regarding these tools.

I hope I have answered all your questions, but if you have any more 
enquiries please feel free to get in touch, or post an enquiry on our forum.

Best Regards and thanks for your interest,
Malcolm Murray

I'm modeling a building for LEED EAc1 compliance, and was wondering how
you are supposed to model existing building HVAC systems if you are
adding square footage to the building.

 

Let's assume you have a 4-story building with a 2-chiller HVAC plant and
dual temp boxes.  If you were to add a 5th floor to the building, what
would your baseline model look like?  I know that the 1st four floors
would use the existing HVAC system, but would your new 5th floor be
treated as a new 15,000 square foot area with packaged RTUs, or would
you add a new chiller to the existing HVAC chilled water plant, and have
that chiller meet all the requirements of App G, and have shutoff VAV
boxes for the 5th floor in lieu of dual temp boxes? 

 

For reference, under our proposed design, we are doing just that:
adding a frictionless chiller to the plant to make up the extra load.

James,

 

If you are only adding an additional floor - and are not renovating any
portion of the existing 1st-4th floors then I would model the 5th floor
as if it was a new building by itself according to App. G guidelines.
See Table G 3.1 item no. 2 in 90.1-2004

 

 

If the entire building is undergoing a renovation but the existing HVAC
systems are existing to remain then the building would be modeled to
reflect the existing system types and capacities. Refer to the LEED
manual for these guidelines.

 

Hope this helps.

James,

Per part b of Seth's reference, his modeling solution only works if you do not cross the line between new and existing with any HVAC services (air, chilled water, hot water, dhw).   Once you do that, things get complicated.

Based on past experience, I highly suggest a through reading of Appendix G, existing CIRs and then writing your own to avoid being forced to remodel by the LEED review.

Paul

Let's assume you have a 4-story building with a 2-chiller HVAC plant and dual temp boxes.  If you were to add a 5th floor to the building, what would your baseline model look like?  I know that the 1st four floors would use the existing HVAC system, but would your new 5th floor be treated as a new 15,000 square foot area with packaged RTUs, or would you add a new chiller to the existing HVAC chilled water plant, and have that chiller meet all the requirements of App G, and have shutoff VAV boxes for the 5th floor in lieu of dual temp boxes?

For reference, under our proposed design, we are doing just that:  adding a frictionless chiller to the plant to make up the extra load.

Thanks for the response Seth.  The entire building is undergoing a
renovation (new windows, insulation, lighting)...and I'm going to keep
the existing HVAC system in the EXISTING portion of the building for my
baseline model.  I just don't know how to treat the NEW portion of my
building in the baseline model.  The plant is interconnected, so Item No
2 in Table G3.1 doesn't apply.  I want to include the existing building
in the model (and I have to).

 

Any other advice on how to properly set up the baseline HVAC system for
a new portion of an existing building if the proposed chilled water
plant is being expanded to accommodate new load but the existing airside
systems in the existing building are NOT being touched?

 

Common sense would say that my baseline building also has a new App G
chiller to accommodate new load and the new airside systems are shutoff
boxes....but if there is a chance that the new portion of the building
is treated as a standalone 15,000 square foot addition, packaged RTUs
may make the proposed system even more efficient.

 

Paul, thanks for the email...I'm going to look thru CIRs and see what I
can find.  Can't wait for LEED v3.0 where this convenient Option goes
away.

 

Thanks again,

James,

 

If you are only adding an additional floor - and are not renovating any
portion of the existing 1st-4th floors then I would model the 5th floor
as if it was a new building by itself according to App. G guidelines.
See Table G 3.1 item no. 2 in 90.1-2004

 

 

If the entire building is undergoing a renovation but the existing HVAC
systems are existing to remain then the building would be modeled to
reflect the existing system types and capacities. Refer to the LEED
manual for these guidelines.

 

Hope this helps.

      2010 ACEEE SUMMER STUDY ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY
      IN BUILDINGS
      *"The Climate for Efficiency is Now "*

*August 15--20, 2010
Asilomar Conference Grounds <http://www.visitasilomar.com/>
Pacific Grove, California *

    *Conference Co-Chairs:*

        *Robert Hawsey, National Renewable Energy Laboratory *
        *Craig Wray, Lawrence Berkeley National Labratory

        *

The 2010 ACEEE Summer Study is the 15th biennial ACEEE conference on 
Energy Efficiency in Buildings. A diverse group of professionals from 
around the world will gather at this preeminent meeting to discuss the 
technological basis for, and practical implementation of, reducing 
energy use and climate impacts associated with buildings. Presentations 
and discussions will relate to the theme, "The Climate for Efficiency is 
Now." Global activities related to energy efficiency in buildings are 
rapidly expanding, in part to stimulate world economies, but also to 
avoid the worst consequences of climate change and resource depletion. 
To achieve its full potential, however, this energy efficiency "engine" 
needs to address sustainable development and climate issues that go 
beyond buildings. Well integrated programs, technologies, and financing 
sources need to be developed. A new generation of multi-disciplinary 
practitioners, researchers, and policymakers needs to be trained and 
quickly deployed to solve the closely-coupled energy efficiency and 
climate problems that we face. Come to the 2010 Summer Study, where you 
can share your ideas and engage in dialogue with leading thinkers, 
visionaries, and luminaries in the field, while experiencing the 
magnificent natural setting of Asilomar.

We invite you to contribute your most creative work in the following areas:

    * energy technologies and information technologies and practices
    * market transformation
    * design and performance of buildings
    * program design, implementation, and evaluation
    * human and social dimensions of energy use
    * utility regulation, strategies, and policy
    * sustainable communities
    * integrating energy efficiency and climate change policies
    * workforce training

*Deadline to submit abstract is October 23, 2009.*

More information, including submitting your abstracts online, is 
available at the conference web site -

Joel,
Google, or search the archives, for converting SEER to EER and you will 
find info related to this. Is in the BLDG-SIM archives and came right up 
using Google.

I looked this up just recently...this is what I found from an old post:

Bryce,

The CEC method is required for compliance purposes, but many use simpler
methods such as converting the SEER to EER by using a multiplier (0.85  to
0.95 are often used) and then converting the EER (95/67) to EIR using a
straight unit conversion.  RESNET which is the body that I've worked with on
software verification methods for nationwide HERS ratings for houses uses
the following equation:

Cooling EIR = 0.941 * (1/(SEER/3.413))

This was developed as a simplification to more complex methods and is based
on a regression analysis of numerous systems.  As I'm sure you're aware, the
conversion of SEER to EER is not exact and depends on the means by which the
manufacturer acheived the SEER.

There are then various assumptions about the part load performance of the
units, but that is another topic.

Good luck,

Pat

Hi Malcolm,

 

Thanks very much for your considerate and informative reply.  I'm very excited to hear about the evolution of Demeter into something much more developed and will certainly be signing up to give the alpha Greenspace Live suite a test-drive!  The development of a solid Sketchup ? TRNSYS bridge  is also very exciting news.

 

I can't speak for everyone here, but I've personally found the [bldg-sim] and other mailing lists hosted at onebuilding.org to be an invaluable source for both technical support from developers/end-users and keeping up to speed with new products and their updates in functionality.  It's my hope the Greenspace team will continue to announce major developments here so individuals such as myself won't miss something important =).

 

Best wishes, 


~Nick

Subject: Re: Fwd: [Bldg-sim] Sketchup <--> Demeter Feedback/Experience

 

Hello Mr Caton and all on the BLDG-Sim mailing list,

Thanks for your feedback and suggestions regarding the Demeter tool and thanks for your continued use of the tool.

As my colleague Donald I Macdonald posted on the Bldg-Sim mailing list yesterday, we have now released a new version of our SketchUp plugin now called LiveEnergy as part of our Greenspace Live suite. The currently released version of the LiveEnergy is entitled LiveEnergy Modeller and allows for the import and export of gbXML files from Google SketchUp, which can then be used in a variety of tools such as our own LiveEnergy EPC tool and other energy analysis software. LiveEnergy Modeller does not currently have GBS enabled directly from the interface, but this is something we may introduce at a later date, we are also working on a version to work with TRNSYS (for more details see the paper recently presented at the Building Simulation 2009 conference: http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_1389_1396.pdf).

We have also released training materials (including tutorial videos) on our website, and have set up a new discussion forum. These can all be accessed on our website at: http://greenspacelive.com where the tools can also be downloaded.

I will now address some of the feedback / issues highlighted in your email.

*	Compatibility with other SketchUp plugins: We have made some efforts in this latest version of the plugin to package the codebase more effectively, so that we shouldn't have as many issues with incompatibilites with other plugins. However, we would be grateful if any compatibility issues arising with other plugins could be reported on our forum so that we can be aware of them. There is also now an option to disable LiveEnergy Modeller from the Google Extensions manager (in the settings window) without uninstalling the plugin.
*	Space Selection: We have now introduced a "semi-automatic" method of selecting spaces. You can now use our "Select Space" tool to simply click on the floor surface of each space and then the enclosing walls should be automatically selected. Spaces are then confirmed by pressing the "Confirm Space" button. This also allows you to manually select which surfaces go into the space so that the user still has the same level of control as before. A "Find Spaces" command is an interesting idea and something we may include in a future version.
*	Cube Interface Size: Our new LiveEnergy interface has been cleaned up, and is no longer a 3D cube. The interface is also much smaller by default, but can be maximised when you need to get into the detailed user interface / construction libraries etc. Much of the emphasis when building a model is now on using SketchUp materials and tools to create the energy model, and not so much in the LiveEnergy interface.
*	GBS Operation: GBS operation has been disabled in this current version of LiveEnergy. The reason why it will no longer work with Demeter, is that the URLs for GBS have changed to Autodesk ones. We have not updated Demeter to account for this, as we have been concentrating on developing the new LiveEnergy Modeller.
*	XML File Extension:  This is has proved to be a challenge due to the SketchUp api, but is something we will develop.
*	Installer Defaults to SketchUp 6: The LiveEnergy installer now defaults to SketchUp 7.
*	Geometry Problems in the gbXML: The gbXML creation should now be significantly improved.
*	Plane Up / Plane Down etc: These options were designed to raise and lower the active section plane when assigning spaces to the internal surfaces etc. This has now been replaced by a single tool "Move Plane" that allows you to move the active plane up and down using the mouse without deselecting surfaces. The "Space Definition" window is no more (although there is a list of spaces in the "Building Envelope" window).
*	Surface Definition: This has now been replaced by a new system using the SketchUp materials pallette that we think is more intuitive and should be more familiar to SketchUp users - you now "paint" the surface type onto each surface. As a way of automatically doing this is something we can look into for a future version.

News and updates about our tools as well as support information etc can all be found on our new website at http://greenspacelive.com

All our tools are currently at an "alpha" stage of development, and are currently all available free of charge on this basis until the 31st of October 2009. Anyone can now sign up to our website and get access to our whole suite including LiveEnergy Modeller and LiveEnergy EPC. We would greatly appreciate your feedback regarding these tools.

I hope I have answered all your questions, but if you have any more enquiries please feel free to get in touch, or post an enquiry on our forum.

Best Regards and thanks for your interest,
Malcolm Murray

Hello Dr. Finlayson,
 
 
 
For whatever reason, I'm having a lot of difficulty searching for
answers to my Demeter inquries through google sketchup groups / bldg-sim
archives / Demeter forums (are they even up?)... and it occurred to me
there simply might not be much discussion out there to look for!  This
email should go a long way to remedy that!
 
 
 
I have some feedback  for your team in the form of constructive
criticism and issues I've had, along with a few related questions.
Overall, I really like what I see so far, though I understand the
project is still under development (the current version hosted on the
website is 0.8.9.2, for anyone following along).  I'll throw out that my
feedback is colored from the perspective I've gained after some
successful experiences working with the free plugin from IES, which ties
into their commercial energy modeling software packages in much the same
way that Demeter is tied to Green Building Studio.  
 
 
 
I'm also copying this feedback to the [bldg-sim] mailing list to spark
some further Demeter discussion/feedback and to request other end-users'
workarounds/experiences for our collective benefit.  It's my hope that
the IES VE-Ware sketchup plugin development team will also review these
points as both tools have some key things to learn from each other...
Any responses you've got addressing these points would be good to post
on [bldg-sim] as well, I'd imagine.
 
 
 
Feedback/Issues encountered:
 
 
 
+             As you may be well aware, one cannot have the IES Sketchup
plugin and the Demeter plugin installed at the same time without
sketchup crashing at every startup.  While one might speculate that you
two development teams might want that, being "competing" products (?), I
think it would be appropriate to recognize that users like myself who
might wish to explore Demeter/GBS vs. IES/IES-VEWare get annoyed when we
have to uninstall/reinstall software to do our jobs.  Ideally I'd like
both installed at the moment anyway - see my next point...
 
 
 
+             Something to note:  There is a real and interesting
contrast in the manner of defining spaces between the IES and Demeter
plugin.  Demeter's capability to "check contiguity" for enclosed
volumes, and to highlight planes that are out-of-whack for ease in
correcting the issue is wonderful.  The IES plugin's approach of "find
spaces" on the other hand is MUCH less tedious than having to manually
select every plane enclosing a space, without an opportunity to correct
one's selection if you accidentally miss or include a stray plane.
Ideally, I think both plugins ought to learn from each other and create
a "find spaces" command that, perhaps with an option ticked, might
perform that function while additionally subsequently highlighting any
and all non-contiguous planes to the defined volumes.  Wouldn't life be
grand? =)
 
 
 
+             The cube user interface is altogether nifty and
functional.  One major improvement however, for those of us without
large displays (Mine runs at 1280x1024), would be to have the option to
have the interface "auto-hide" until one mouses-over the top of the
window.  As it is the model interface window uses up half of my working
space, making it kinda difficult to manipulate my model views to
correctly select/de-select faces for defining the spaces.
 
 
 
+             I cannot get the "energy analyse" cube-face to operate
correctly with GBS.  It gives me an error consistently telling me
"Webserver Logon Failed."  Any thoughts?
 
 
 
+             (Nitpick) Whenever I export an xml file using the
interface or plugin drop-down feature, the resulting file has no
extension.  Adding .xml however allows GBS desktop to recognize the file
for importing.
 
 
 
+             (Nitpick) The installer I have tries by default to install
to a Google Sketchup 6 directory.  I'm using version 7 (this may be the
root of some of my other issues).  It'd be nice/convenient if the
installer could figure that out on its own what is the appropriate
directory.
 
 
 
+             Once the exported .xml file is selected in the appropriate
GBS desktop field, I cannot successfully complete a run.  Trying to view
the model in VRML results in an error reading "geometry is not a field
of Material."  I suspect incompatible versions of sketchup/GBS/Demeter
is the root of this issue...?
 
 
 
+             Back to the UI:  The "Space Definition" face of the cube
has three buttons whose function I have not been able to figure out, nor
find documentation explaining their purpose.  Plane Up / Plane Down /
Plane Tool.  If they are intended to be some alternative to manually
selecting each face of a volume, that would be a step in the right
direction for ease of use (see above).
 
 
 
+             Regarding the "Surface Definition" face of the cube...
here I have to get more critical.  The first model I tried this out on
has something like 600+ faces.  Your interface does not allow one to
define more than one face at a time.  One should be able to first select
and change an entire space's face properties as a group, and
subsequently be able to select multiple faces at a time to change their
properties.  I hate to sound partial to IES but it sure is nice that the
IES plugin figures out what is a floor vs. a roof vs. an
interior/exterior wall automatically (though to what degree of accuracy
I've not ascertained)...  Something that both automatically guesses
(with some accuracy) surface definitions, while allowing the end-user to
easily review and edit those properties would be ideal for both plugins.
 
 
 
+             While I obviously am having trouble getting GBS to play
nicely with Demeter, I'm very hopeful that a successfully created .inp
file from GBS, originating from a Sketchup/Demeter model, will correctly
and accurately be importable into eQuest, where a good number of us
energy modelers get a lot of "post-preliminary-design-stage" work done.
That would bridge a long-desired path I've had regarding establishing a
workflow from Sketchup --> eQuest.  Previous mailing list postings have
indicated this is a possibility, but as it stands with whatever
combination of compatibility/end-user (me) issues exist, I've yet to see
this pull through with my own eyes.  I hope GBS's ties with Autodesk's
Ecotect product won't impair this possibility in the future.
 
 
 
+             On that note, could you clarify for myself and others the
relationship that exists between the development teams for Demeter
(Green Space Research) Green Building Studio, and Autodesk's Ecotect
software?  To what extent might the goals of one group
influence/restrict the others?
 
 
 
+             Is there a mailing list one can join to be notified
if/when new versions of Demeter are developed?
 
 
 
I hope this feedback is useful to many, and would encourage other users
of Sketchup/Demeter/IES/GBS to chime in with their thoughts and
experiences!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Call For Papers for the Symposium on Simulation for
 Architecture and Urban Design
Message-ID: <F1E75E6A55B2BB4EA5416D97E680C7815D5FD762C2@ADSK-NAMSG-02.MGDADSK.autodesk.com>

Call for Papers to the Symposium on Simulation for Architecture and Urban Design at the 2010 Spring Simulation Multiconference (SimAUD<http://www.simaud.org/>).
[cid:image001.png at 01CA2D95.215D2550]
This new Symposium on Simulation for Architecture and Urban Design offers a venue for architecture researchers and simulation researchers to come together to focus on this important area. Buildings are the largest consumers of energy responsible for 48% of all Green House Gas emissions and due to the complexity and multidisciplinary aspects of architecture design and construction, and urban design and society, modeling and simulation become valuable techniques to understand and optimize this enormous challenge. Scientists, engineers, managers, educators, and business professionals who develop or use simulation tools are invited to participate and present original papers.
SimAUD is where the Architecture community meets the Simulation community, as well as the UbiComp, Design, HCI, InfoViz and Computer Graphics communities. We are also interested in research from related fields as they apply to the built environment.
All submissions are peer-reviewed and considered for selection by the Committee. All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library<http://portal.acm.org/dl.cfm>. The conference is run in collaboration with ACM/SIGSIM and is sponsored by The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.
We invite research works in several categories:

?         Papers & Notes

?         Data Sets (with Note)

?         Video Showcase (with Extended Abstract)



Key Dates (All Submission Types)

Abstracts Deadline: November 20, 2009
The Abstract submission should be a short paragraph describing the topics to be covered in the full submission (to be submitted one week later). The Abstracts will NOT be reviewed and are simply to help the Committee to begin to recruit the number of reviewers needed in the appropriate sub-disciplines.

Submission Deadline: November 27, 2009
This is the date when papers (archival format, 10 pages maximum for full papers, 4 pages maximum for short papers), data sets, and videos must be submitted. At least 3 reviewers will be assigned to each submission.

Acceptance Notification: January 22, 2010
Authors will receive their peer-review feedback and acceptance decision by this date. Accepted works will then have a short period of time to integrate reviewer feedback before submitting the final Camera-ready deadline.

Camera-ready Due: February 5, 2010
At this date, final submissions of accepted works are due.

Conference Presentations: April 12-15, 2010
Authors will present their works at the venue in Orlando Florida, USA during the Symposium on Simulation for Architecture and Urban Design. See you there!

Why Submit to SimAUD?
Unlike other research conferences and symposia that merely provide a venue for publishing research on a particular topic, SimAUD will work to build a closer community for cross-pollinating domain knowledge, collaborative work and co-authoring of research that envisions the future of the built environment. Important to this work is understanding and modeling our current built and natural environments. From there, we can validate our simulations against existing physical systems. Once validated, we can have confidence that simulating new designs or design alternatives, will accurately compute outcomes. Therefore we encourage the submission of case studies documenting lessons learned so that SimAUD can also be a resource of best practices. Papers may also propose extensions to modeling and simulation standards, such as IFC, gbXML, LandXML, and CityGML, to advance progress, or identify and propose new standards that are needed. We encourage members of the community to submit models of their own buildings, campuses, or cities, and to participate actively as leaders in local initiatives and solutions (which make great case study submissions too).
Simulation is a "game-changer" in architecture. We now need to minimize the impact of human activity on the environment, especially in the face of an increasing population. Within this scope, the built environment is the most significant contributor to the problems of climate change. The built environment is a complex system, and planning for change requires high-quality modeling and simulation. Single buildings are key to making change, but urban design must also be considered. By submitting your original research to SimAUD, you contribute directly to the global effort to untangle the complexities of urban development and mitigate the negative effects of human activity on the planet.

Karen, this seems to contradict your earlier statement.  Or more likely,
I'm just not comprehending it.

 

As Cam pointed out, the user's manual says that when an existing system
exists, as in an existing building that is being built out for a tenant,
the HVAC system in the baseline may match the proposed.  This makes
sense to me, and it was how I understood the modeling requirements.

 

However, it doesn't go into more depth than this, and neither do the
CIRs, if there are modifications to the existing plant to increase
efficiency, but that do NOT alter the system type.

 

As another example:

 

LEED building, 10-stories, existing water-cooled chilled water plant
serving dual duct terminals.

 

The manuals and CIRs basically say:

 

For modified areas/systems: The Proposed Building Performance is
calculated as per design. The Baseline Building Performance is
calculated as per ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G requirements

For areas/systems not modified: Both the Proposed and the Baseline
Building Performance must be modeled as per the existing conditions.

 

This is straight out of a CIR ruling dated 2/9/09.

 

But what if we took our example building, and made a minor change to,
say, the AHUs (as part the LEED project, we installed VFDs to replace a
pressure bypass configuration).

 

Is this "modifying" the existing systems enough so that we would then
have to model the Baseline HVAC system per the App G requirements
(System 7 or 8) in lieu of modeling the baseline HVAC system as the
existing system (dual duct system)?  Or could we just bring the AHUs up
to App G requirements (temperatures, VFD, fan HP sizing, etc), and leave
the chilled water plant and air distribution system as it currently
exists since we aren't modifying those?

 

Thanks for any clarification.

 

This is particularly important for this project because the Client does
not have sufficient funds to upgrade the chilled water plant, so all
existing equipment is to remain.  If I have to bring the Baseline HVAC
system completely to App G standards, that's a huge penalty since the
proposed building chillers are older.

Thanks for the response Seth.  The entire building is undergoing a
renovation (new windows, insulation, lighting)...and I'm going to keep
the existing HVAC system in the EXISTING portion of the building for my
baseline model.  I just don't know how to treat the NEW portion of my
building in the baseline model.  The plant is interconnected, so Item No
2 in Table G3.1 doesn't apply.  I want to include the existing building
in the model (and I have to).

 

Any other advice on how to properly set up the baseline HVAC system for
a new portion of an existing building if the proposed chilled water
plant is being expanded to accommodate new load but the existing airside
systems in the existing building are NOT being touched?

 

Common sense would say that my baseline building also has a new App G
chiller to accommodate new load and the new airside systems are shutoff
boxes....but if there is a chance that the new portion of the building
is treated as a standalone 15,000 square foot addition, packaged RTUs
may make the proposed system even more efficient.

 

Paul, thanks for the email...I'm going to look thru CIRs and see what I
can find.  Can't wait for LEED v3.0 where this convenient Option goes
away.

 

Thanks again,

James,

 

If you are only adding an additional floor - and are not renovating any
portion of the existing 1st-4th floors then I would model the 5th floor
as if it was a new building by itself according to App. G guidelines.
See Table G 3.1 item no. 2 in 90.1-2004

 

 

If the entire building is undergoing a renovation but the existing HVAC
systems are existing to remain then the building would be modeled to
reflect the existing system types and capacities. Refer to the LEED
manual for these guidelines.

 

Hope this helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Existing building HVAC modeling

 

I'm modeling a building for LEED EAc1 compliance, and was wondering how
you are supposed to model existing building HVAC systems if you are
adding square footage to the building.

 

Let's assume you have a 4-story building with a 2-chiller HVAC plant and
dual temp boxes.  If you were to add a 5th floor to the building, what
would your baseline model look like?  I know that the 1st four floors
would use the existing HVAC system, but would your new 5th floor be
treated as a new 15,000 square foot area with packaged RTUs, or would
you add a new chiller to the existing HVAC chilled water plant, and have
that chiller meet all the requirements of App G, and have shutoff VAV
boxes for the 5th floor in lieu of dual temp boxes? 

 

For reference, under our proposed design, we are doing just that:
adding a frictionless chiller to the plant to make up the extra load.

Dear All,

                      There are some queries of me related to equest
hope you might be able to share your knowledge with me on those issues


1:  Can i know where in parametric run we can create a component as
demand controlled ventilation for proposed case i was trying to search
it but could not find if anyone of you know please tell me where it is
if it exists

2: where can we create component as overhangs (shading) for proposed case.

3: where can we create component as air side economizer in proposed case


I Shall be obliged if you kindly  respond to these doubts

Thanks

Hi All,

             I simulated on building in equest i am getting nearly 92
hrs for each conditioned zone as unmet hrs can you tell me what could
be the reason and what should i do to solve this problem in the air
side hvac  tabe there is option as supply air cfm input shall i leave
it black so the it will be auto size or i shall give the supply cfm
input there.

2 How can i rotate base case in 4 orientations in equest.

3 In the DD wizrd no 15 there is input as  interior end use
contributing to space load as following

 interior ambient lighting

interior task lighting

office equipment

cooking equipment

miscellaneous equipment

process load

motors

air compressors

sir my question is that apart from ambient lighting and equipment
which other  interior  end use should i take if my project is a office
and a retail.

4 When applying the heat recovery wheel in parametric run one option
comes there as (recovery-exaust---- yes/no?)  does the meaning of
taking it yes is that we are taking the exaust recovery wheel?

Thanks
Sambhav.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] How to set up a (simple) H/V system with night-time
	cooling
Message-ID: <FD49521620A94E43B6D384F2F5594A274B10A30A@TEMAIL01.taylor-engineering.com>

I am trying to figure out how to best simulate the intended behavior of 100% OA VAV heating/ventilating system with night time precooling of thermal mass.  At the moment, I don't care much about accuracy of the energy performance. I am more concerned with forcing the system to behave in specific ways, and observing the impact that this has on temperatures.

I'm currently using the system type UVT, since it seemed simplest, though the HVSYS might be more appropriate.

During the day, I want the system to supply air as follows:

1)      If the outdoor temp is less than the zone temp, supply up to a set CFM/SF (which I will vary over several runs) to utilize free cooling

2)      If the zone is occupied, supply 15 CFM/person (or control by DCV, but if that's more complex to set up I may not bother for now.)

3)      If the zone is unoccupied, supply 0.15 CFM/SF
If #1 is hard to implement, I could live with just #2 and #3 for now.

During the night, I want the system to supply a flow rate that I specify, preferably on a square foot basis.  (I plan to vary this from 0.5 CFM/SF to 2.0 CFM/SF to observe how this impact daytime temperatures, to figure out the right night time cooling rate and time period.)  I want it to provide this airflow regardless of the OA temp or zone temp - I'll control it with a schedule to prevent night time cooling in winter.  Mostly, I want to make sure that I'm getting as much air to the zones as I think I am - I don't want the air volume to be overridden by e.g. the zone thermostat.

I can turn the fan on and off via a schedule.  The two things I'm not sure how to do are:

1)      Disable all economizer activity.  This is a 100% OA system.  I can set MIN-OUTSIDE-AIR (At the system level) to 1.0, but is that enough?  I don't want it overridden by zone settings.

2)      Control the airflow on a CFM/SF basis at night, while avoiding any override by the zones or other inputs.  When the fans run, I want them to supply the airflow I specify, period.

Thanks for any suggestions you can offer.

Hi All
         I was doing on building in equest but the problem is that my
ground floor and first floor base points are not matching in the
building 3d can you tell the solution

There is a option in DD wizard1

as specify exact site coordinate what should i fill in that for my
ground and first floor to match the base points

and what should i put in the option(distance from reference shell)

I look forward for your response

Thanks

It depends.
?
System per shell means a system per whatever you defined as a shell. It could be an entire building, it could be a floor, it could be several floors. System per site would mean a system for everything in the run, which could conceivably mean side by side buildings with one HVAC system (strange, but conceivable).
?
I have defined a 32 story tower with 6 shells. Each of those shells have a separate HVAC system if I define a System per shell.
?
Sambhav, where are you located? Perhaps some of our eQuest colleagues may be in the general vicinity to help you directly on your "queries."

I've gotten a few responses saying that the elevations are in meters.  The altitude correction factor that eQUEST uses is 1.06, which corresponds to an altitude of about 1,600 feet.  Any thoughts on how to a) notify eQUEST that the elevation is in meters, or b) modify the elevation in the bin file?

Hi,
        I modeled on building in visualdoe ans equest just to see the
annual energy comparasion in both tools

What i seen was the same building with same parameters i have given
for u value LPD, EPD,Schedules ,construction, building
orientation,glass type,windo wall ratio ,HVAC system type,cfm/person
,means every thing same from a to z but still a great difference is
coming in annual energy consumption as

Visual doe

294000kwh

Equest

214000kwh

I checked out every thing again but didnt found any mismatch in input
for both tools in input but still this difference is coming can you
suggest some solution

Thanks

? ? ? ? I modeled on building in visualdoe ans equest just to see the
annual energy comparasion in both tools

What i seen was the same building with same parameters i have given
for u value LPD, EPD,Schedules ,construction, building
orientation,glass type,windo wall ratio ,HVAC system type,cfm/person
,means every thing same from a to z but still a great difference is
coming in annual energy consumption as

Visual doe

294000kwh

Equest

214000kwh

I checked out every thing again but didnt found any mismatch in input
for both tools in input but still this difference is coming can you
suggest some solution

Thanks
Sambhav.

Hi,
       I was applying space by space method for LPD but for spaces
like lifts and washrooms its not mentioned in space by space method
that what shall be the LPD for these spaces.Then what LPD should i
consider for base case for lifts and washrooms.



Thanks

Are there standard practice recommendations for where to place your wall
for a simulation?  Knowing every wall has thickness, but the simulation
engines are generally just using no thickness walls with a calculated
U/R value, where should you define your walls for the simulation?
Should they be defined at the exterior face of the wall, the interior

increase the zone volume, thus incorrectly determining the energy usage,
but the interior face underestimates the exterior exposure of the wall.
The center of wall seems a good compromise, but is difficult to identify

For interior walls/zone delineation the same question applies.  From an

the higher load zone or the lower load zone or split the difference?

Thanks for any advice or direction to standard practices.

My practice with all load calculation/energy modeling software has been:

 

All floors/roofs: Top of surface

Exterior glazing/walls: Outermost surface

Interior walls/partitions:  Center of construction

 

I know this is the advice offered by IES-VE's support staff, but that
doesn't mean all modeling engines behave the same.  As you may gather,
I've always assumed energy modeling and HVAC load calculation models
"subtract out" the thickness of constructions from calculated space
volumes.  I don't know whether this is a "universal standard practice"
between software packages / modeling engines.

 

Since I would ultimately much rather slightly oversize than undersize an
HVAC system, I'm of the mindset that the potential for a little extra
surface area / conditioned space would if anything bump my results in a
desired, conservative direction regarding space loads.  If absolute
accuracy is your goal, then in lieu of a "universal standard," I'd
imagine you would have to ask the developers/users of the specific
program you're using at the moment to determine its true behavior in
this regard.

All,

I generally agree with Nick's approach.  I said the same thing in the 
ASHRAE HOF Residential Loads chapter (which I revised in 2005).  For 
residences, this scheme reconciles with US practice for determining 
floor area (a nominal 1000 ft2 house is 1000 ft2 only if you include 
the exterior wall thickness) -- that makes it easy to check input.

Volume is overstated, as noted, but generally only minimally.  I've 
also seen procedures for doing blower door leakage tests that 
recommend estimating volume from outside dimensions.

All in all, then, the outside dimension method is simple to apply 
consistently, easy to check, and accurate enough.

On the other hand, it does NOT agree with other standards and 
procedures that are in use.  There is an ASTM standard that defines 
floor area (I think) and uses inside dimensions.  Also, I think 
rentable space is sometimes measured from the window inside surface 
(which I guess is the real estate version of split the difference?).

As automated data exchange procedures become more ubiquitous, 
definitions like this will have to be rigorously standardized so 
building model fidelity can be retained as data is passed among 
applications.  There is an ASHRAE project getting underway related to 
consistent extraction of a thermal model from a BIM.  That is a step.

Unless you are looking at very small spaces, I just don't see the extra
volume being added to the space as introducing that significant of an
inaccuracy to the model compared to all of the other approximations,
estimations, and outright guesses we have to make to construct an energy
model.

 

Just think of any wall that is a curved surface that most programs have to
approximate as a series of planar surfaces. You can't perfectly match the
proper volume there either.

I'm working on a project that is looking into installing a photovoltaic
system on the roof, and wants to look into LEED EAc2. I have a two part
question:

 

1.       To get the EA credits, should I base the array size on only the
building's electric use, or should I base it on the total energy use
including non-electric usage?

2.       If the project gets high pressure steam and chilled water from
a central plant, do I include the central plan energy, or only the pump
energy for circulating the steam/chilled water?

 

Thanks in advance for your advice.

Vikram,


1.       Per the v2.2 Reference Guide, you should use the total energy cost for the building, not the electric-only energy cost.

2.       If your project was registered after May 28, 2008, the document "Required Treatment of District Thermal Energy in LEED-NC v2.2 and LEED for Schools" makes it clear that you must include the central plant energy in the EAc2 calculations.  If registered prior to May 28, 2008, then only the energy associated with your modeled building/systems.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED EAc2 baseline

I'm working on a project that is looking into installing a photovoltaic system on the roof, and wants to look into LEED EAc2. I have a two part question:


1.       To get the EA credits, should I base the array size on only the building's electric use, or should I base it on the total energy use including non-electric usage?

2.       If the project gets high pressure steam and chilled water from a central plant, do I include the central plan energy, or only the pump energy for circulating the steam/chilled water?

Thanks in advance for your advice.

UFAD Systems, including the supply plenum geometry and associated convective, conductive, and radiant heat transfer paths, underfloor fan-powered boxes, various control schemes, and plenum leakage can be modeled in the IES Virtual Environment. Whether this would be "easy" or not would depend significantly upon your level of proficiency and experience.

Hi All,
                I modeled one 2 floor building in equest taking
packaged multi zone system but in the annual energy consumption it is
showing energy consumption in pump/aux also which is surprising boz
packaged multizone system is not having any water side HVAC only air
size HVAC hence pump energy consumption should be zero. but still it
is showing abt 6500kwh consumption in pump can you suggest the
solution

Also should i  leave light off and equipment and miscellaneous  and
DHW profiles  as it is in the wizard mode  or edit there, bcoz in
detailed edit mode i will define my all of these mentioned schedules .


Thanks
Sambhav.

Hi All,
                 I modeled one building with packaged multizone system
in which there is simultaneous cooling as well as heating for heating
i have given source as furnance .But when results of annual energy
consumptions are comming it is showing zero energy consumption for
space heating which i think it should not show because we have given
heating also ans it is showing gas consumption for pump and auxillary
.


Sir what do you suggest whether it should should space heating also .


Thanks

Dear friends,
I need your help in modeling a building with hybrid (Natural + Mechanical)
ventilation.

There is air conditioning system in the building.

I would like to get the temperature & humidity for all zone as end result.

Can I do it in eQUEST? If yes, then how?

Further I would like to use night ventilation with high thermal mass as a
measure to improve comfort.

I hope many of you would have faced this, please let me know the solution.

warm regards,
Prashant

Message-ID: <69a9bc0a0909151421w418f5d43j64408c7b8d217699@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm completing a model of a building that is heated by a central campus
steam plant for LEED NC 2.2 EA P1 and C1.  I've followed the guidelines in
"Required Treatment of District Thermal Energy in LEED NC 2.2 and LEED for
Schools" dated May 28, 2008.

I'm doing pretty well, but I'm a bit confused by the following paragraph
(page 8 under the heading: Energy Model Implementation ? Energy rates)

Step 2 (Aggregate Building / DES scenario) ? in this modeling scenario the
DES-supplied energy is not
modeled as cost-neutral purchased energy, and thus purchased DES rates
(chilled water, steam, hot
water) are ignored. Fuel and electricity rates are assigned using the local
utility rate schedules as they
would normally apply to the building and using the normal ASHRAE and LEED
modeling rules. For
the Baseline Building the rates are applied to the code-compliant heating or
cooling plant as instructed
in Appendix G, and for the Proposed Building the rates are applied to the
virtual plant according to the
actual energy sources used in the upstream DES (electricity, gas, oil,
etc.).

They are a bit unclear...

If the central plant burns #6 oil, do you use the local rate for #6 oil for
the proposed system and the local rate for home heating oil for the
baseline?

OR

do you use the local rate for home heating oil for both?

Has anyone submitted one of these projects yet?

Thanks for your help.

Dear All...
We have created a collaborative platform VIBYOR.com to speed up *energy
simulation learning*.

We are inviting interested energy simulators to share their expertise
through tXchange on the Platform. tXhange allows a user to publish her/his
tutorial on VIBYOR.com such that others can benefit and contributor can
track the usage.

For more information on tXchange program, please click
here.<http://vibyor.com/txchange> We
will be booking tutorial authoring requests on first-come-first-serve basis.
(registration to the site is needed along with brief profile information on
the registration page itself).

We recommend authoring tutorials on specific and granular topics for example
"How to model doughnut geometry in VisualDOE", or "How to model Cool-Roof in
eQUEST" rather than very expansive topics.

Eric,

You can find that article at:
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/dirun/1901.pdf (page 6) if you want to
look at it in more detail.  In that on page 7, they state:

"The fictitious insulating layer is required to give the correct
effective resistance for the construction..." and also "The procedure
makes the approximation that the heat transfer through an underground
surface with no exposed perimeter, such as a basement floor, is zero."

The fictitious R is to more closely approximate the realistic conditions
of the earth contact.

Dear All,

I`m modelling  a 3 floor non-building using the appendix G. According  
to the size and type of the building,  the baseline HVAC system type  
would be a "packaged rooftop VAV with reheat" (system 6). The proposed  
building has a heat pump for heating and cooling of about 500 kW. Does  
anybody knows about the baseline efficiencies for both cooling and  
heating? I have checked 90.1 standard and it seems that they would be  
COP 1 (heating) COP 2.7 (cooling). Am I right?

?
If I understand you correctly, your Proposed Building has the 500 kW size of heat pump. What goes into the Baseline Case should be the COP based on all of the modeling assumptions from Appendix G and the actual physical configuration of the building, which may or may not be the same size as what is being installed.

The proposed building has a heat pump for heating and cooling of about 500 kW. Does anybody knows about the baseline efficiencies for both cooling and heating? I have checked 90.1 standard and it seems that they would be COP 1 (heating) COP 2.7 (cooling). Am I right?


Thanks,

Felipe,
-I think you?re right; Table 6.8.1A shows 9.2 EER which is 2.7 COP on cooling side (sized for electric heat ?760k).

Felipe:

If I understand you correctly, your Proposed Building has the 500 kW size of heat pump. What goes into the Baseline Case should be the COP based on all of the modeling assumptions from Appendix G and the actual physical configuration of the building, which may or may not be the same size as what is being installed.

Thanks Jeremy, but I think my question is different than how you may have interpreted it.  I'm wondering why does the article
 recommend changing both the U-EFFECTIVE and the ficticious material.
 
The article says in one place that the heat transfer, Q = [U-EFFECTIVE]*A(Tg - Ti).  Then, it later says, as you quoted, "The 
fictitious insulating layer is required to give the correct effective resistance for the construction..."
 
So which is it???  Is there some sort of heat balance that needs to happen with the two? Does the ficticious layer somehow
 influence the weighting factors even though it has no mass???

Hi All
              I had one queary pertaning to equest  . I have a
packaged multizone system in my base case and for the proposed case i
want to go with a VAV system so when i went to parametric run and
clicked created parametric component there i went to HVAC system and
changed the system type to VAV in the list of options available but i
want to given number of chillers and 1 air and 1 water cooled along
with 1 cooling tower but all these options are not comming the the
list of parametric run then i should i proceed.

Second doubt in the wizard there comes one options as interior end use
contributing to cooling load.
and no of options are

interior ambient lighting

interior task lighting

office end use equipments

miscellaneos equipments

self cont referigerations

motors

process load

air compressors

Which among these all should i take as cooling load for the space(only
ambient light and off equipment or motors also) or what you suggest.
how will the cooling load in space  contributes due to pumps and fans
of HVAC system come in account.

I look for your response

Sambhav:

You cannot change straight shot system types or Package to CHW with parametrics per se. You need to create another separate file to use these new SYSTEMS/PLANT. Then in the parametrics run, you can call out the different file and run THAT files, with the results appearing in the Original run.

Others have probably done this more often than me..

Mr John.

Dear SIr,
                  I got your point what i did was i created one more
file of the original file .The original file was have the system
packaged multizone and in the copy of that file i changed the system
to VAV with 2 (air+water cooled chiller) and now in the new file i
will apply the other parametric runs like u value of construction and
better glazing and others etc. And then i will compare the proposed
case in my new file which i got by appliying paremetric run with my
earlier file . now earlier file wiil be the base case for me . Is this
the way to go sir.


And sir in base case we have to run the building in 4 orientations is
there some option to do it in equest.

Thanks
Sambhav.

Bill,

Thank you very much for your email. Since I have ASHRAE 90.1 2007 SI  
Edition, the cooling efficiencies for a "split system and single  
package" are in metric units. For cooling the minimum efficiency is  
COP 2.7 (kW / kW) which is equivalent in imperial units to EER 9.2  
(Btuh/kW). For heating the baseline efficiency will be COP 1 (Electric  
Resistance).

Dear sir,

My question is regarding the calculations used in the AirflowNetwork model. In the calculations for Pressure and Airflow (regarded as the first step of this model in the Engineering Reference Document), it is used two values of air density (for inside and outside) for objects "AirflowNetwork:Multizone:Component Detailed Opening" and "AirflowNetwork:Multizone:Component Simple Opening". My question is:

Do these two values of air density vary according to the temperature of the inside and outside, respectively? And if not, in what way does the calculation for air flow take into consideration the stack effects? thank you for you time to answer these questions.

With kind regards,

Pedro Peixeiro.

Hi ,
           I am working on a building for energy modelling using
equest now just able to finish the dxf files .I had some queries
before proceeding with equest

1:  When my 3d model is created in equest can equest tell what is
north east west south and overall window wall ratio of the building?
if y where?

2: Can equest show what is overall conditioned area of building if yes
where it shows?

3: How to get the base case in such a manner that it is average of
four orientations in equest

4: when i am drawing the interior zones of the dxf in the equest then
when i have to go in next shell (floor) and import the next floor at
the time it merges the floor with the previeous one so that there is
difficuilty in drawing internal zones is there any option so that we
can switch off the previous floor dxf so that we dont have any problem
in drawing the current dxf zones.

I look forward for your valuable response

Thanks
Sambhav.

Hi Sambhav,

I'm copying your email to the eQuest-Users mailing list, where I would
advise posting future eQuest-specific queries for more timely support.

1. The answer is yes.  The "where" to your question depends on more
specifically what you're asking to learn.  If you are trying to define
percentage of windows for each face from the beginning, in a simple
fashion, that can be done in the same set of wizard screens where you've
imported and traced your building dxf outline/zones (#6 more precisely).
If you are trying to determine the actual percentage glazing after doing
a custom window/door placement from the same wizard screen #6, you can
find this by:
	a.  Running a calculation
	b.  Click 'Tools' --> 'View Simulation Output...'
	c.  Scroll to the last page of the LV-D report (Details of
Exterior Surfaces) and divide the appropriate sum (overall or by
specific orientation) 	for "WINDOW AREA" into the corresponding sum for
"WINDOW+WALL AREA"

2. In the second wizard screen, where you define your custom
footprint/zoning, you can subsequently click the "Zone characteristics"
button, where you can initially define simply which zone are
conditioned/unconditioned.  The floor plan displayed on that screen has
text which will dynamically tell you the percentage conditioned vs.
unconditioned as you toggle various zones between the two.  I think this
is the easiest way to do this in eQuest, though personally I think I
would be more inclined to use the "area" function in AutoCAD if you've
got your DXF file prepared.

3. If you're referring to a 90.1 baseline design for something like
LEED, this is most easily accomplished at the very end of your inputs by
defining the 3 additional orientations as new azimuths (90, 180,270) for
parametric runs.  For a more detailed explanation I'd encourage you to
first examine (and bookmark) the equest-users archives:
http://lists.onebuilding.org/pipermail/equest-users-onebuilding.org/

4. Yes.  In the zone/perimeter definition screens, where you lay out the
verticies, there is a box on the left hand side labeled "Background:."
Select " -none- " from that dropdown box.

Good luck and best wishes on your energy modeling, Sambhav!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] infrared heating
Message-ID: <3cbed0ed0909260618lad0d2d8nf7d3d15d689464c8@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,


I was asked to study the performance of IR heating panels. Has anyone
studied such panels before? Judging on the ASHRAE 55, e.g. I can only
conclude discomfort due to radiant assymetry. However, I don't want to judge
that quickly. As I did not find  any other references on IR heating, I
wondered whether any of you had been using or studying this.

Thanks already for any feedback!

Subject: [Bldg-sim] CHP and thermal storage
Message-ID: <3cbed0ed0909260639h14be50b9y825bf89caca77ab5@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

does any of you know about a study for the size of a thermal storage in
order to have a CHP working electrically driven?
The idea is to determine the size of thermal storage (either a storage
thank, either building mass) for mainly residential buildings in order to be
able to control the CHP based on the electricity price and demand. Of
course, seen from an energy consicious point of view, i.e. without throwing
away heat.

Thanks for any help!

Message-ID: <1254142247.20180@naturalintelligence.us>

   All,

   My former empoyer decided to drop energy modeling as a business
   offering. I am now immediately available for freelance work in both
   commercial and residential energy modeling using eQUEST, EnergyPlus and
   Energy-10. To date I have completed over a dozen projects for design
   case analyses, federal tax credit and/or USGBC LEED certification. I
   also have a very strong background in IT, am dangerous in building
   science and have Manual J and D experience. Competitive rates, hourly
   or fixed fees. Email reply off-list or telephone me at 919-801-0734.

   For the right offer I would consider permanent full-time employment
   including relocation.

   Thank you for your attention.

   - Christian
