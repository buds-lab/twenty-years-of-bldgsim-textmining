*Announcing the 10th International Radiance Workshop, August 24-26, 2011*

Lawrence Berkeley National Lab is hosting the 10th International Radiance
Workshop in Berkeley, California.  The annual workshop is an international
gathering of Radiance users ranging in experience from novice to expert.


Dates:
Wednesday, August 24 - Seminar day
Thursday, August 25 - Workshop Day 1
Friday, August 26 - Workshop Day 2


We are hosting a pre-workshop seminar day on Wednesday August 24.  On the
seminar day, John Mardaljevic will present a crash course on the Radiance
Ambient calculation.  Additionally, Greg Ward, Jacob Jonsson, Peter
Apian-Bennewitz and Christian Kohler will present new developments in
measuring, characterizing and simulating complex fenestration systems (CFS)
using bidirectional scattering distribution functions (BSDF).  New BSDF
related improvements in the Radiance code enable users to easily simulate
sunlight redirecting systems, optically complex shading systems and dynamic
facades.


The two day workshop (August 25-26) is comprised of Radiance user
presentations.  A few presentation slots are still available, if you are
interested in presenting please email Andy McNeil (amcneil at lbl.gov) with a
title and description of your presentation.  No marketing presentations are

Richard,

Are you using the default infiltration rate (0.038 cfm/ft2 of external wall area) for the perimeter spaces?

eQUEST calculates the cfm based on the external wall area and then converts this to an infiltration flow (cfm/ft2 of floor area of the space).

As Fredrick has pointed out this infiltration flow assigned by eQUEST to each perimeter space is not depended on the climate.

See the help section screenshot below:


[cid:image002.jpg at 01CC50FC.B0DA02C0]

It is a flat rate assigned to each space and does not include any wind speed correction and inside-outside temperature difference. The 0.038 cfm/ft2 (of external wall area) infiltration rate was included in the ASHRAE Standard 90.1-1989 as a beginning assumption and that's what shows up in eQUEST as default.

It is good that you are questioning the effect of infiltration on the energy use of building that you are modeling. In the absence of blower door test results it is difficult to imagine the real infiltration rate in a building as it depends on many factors such as the workmanship of the actual construction, stack effect, inside-outside temperature difference, wind-speed and how well the building is pressurized by the HVAC system.

I'll suggest go through the following study by PNNL: Infiltration Modeling Guidelines for Commercial Building Energy Analysis<http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-18898.pdf>

Although the report is Energy Plus specific but it can be applied to eQUEST as well. In a recent project I used the PNNL guidelines and further converted the infiltration flow for each space to air-changes per hour to take the wind-speed correction into account. This method still has limitation of not taking into account the inside-outside temperature difference (see above screen-shot). I found the rest of the methods that include both wind-speed correction and inside-outside temperature difference to be specific to residential buildings.

Hope it helps.

Thanks.

There are several significant energy related changes proposed in LEED 2012 rating systems at http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=2516
Referencing ASHRAE 90.1-2010 was a foregone conclusion but it also gets into source energy use intensity, data center modeling guidelines and many more fascinating new areas.

Here is our second opportunity to comment and I do not believe they necessarily will offer us a third.

Message-ID: <62A5753687FA489582B2B9AC56623A08@MRENG.local>

Hi,

 

I'm preparing a model for an office building for LEED Canada CS 2009.
Modelling is with EE4 following NRCan rules with an MNECB reference
building.  Base building includes rooftop units, baseboard perimeter heat,
core area with washrooms, electrical rooms, stairwells, elevators, etc.  One
floor of the building has a ceiling in place with VAV boxes, diffusers and
lights laid out for an open office plan (as laid out in the lease).  The
other two floors of the building have VAV boxes installed as base building
but the tenants will be responsible for installing lights or diffusers in
tenant fit-ups.  Walls will probably be added and VAV boxes may need to
change at that point in time.

 

I had the owner put requirements in the lease for lighting power density and
lighting controls (Core Performance Guide) so I'll be claiming credit for
those.  The problem I have is that there are no floor layouts indicating
open office areas, private offices, conference rooms, staff rooms, etc. so
I'm not sure what to use for reference building lighting power density and
plug loads in the leased tenant areas.  My first thought for lighting was to
use the building area method for the reference building then use a mix of
actual installed lighting and Core Performance Guide lighting densities in
the proposed assuming all open office plans for the tenant fit-up areas.
Any comments would be appreciated.  

 

As a side note, I don't see any requirement in Canada for 25% of energy
being process like there is in the US.

 

Thanks,

Aaron

Dear Gents,

I work in empirical validation research using an Australian software which I
believe is very similar in many aspects to EneryPlus.

In the Australian software the infiltration rate is informed by the:

-          wind speed data fro the climate file

-          The nominated terrain category and a 

-          Default constant value regardless of wind speed

 

 

 

I have some research which has linked variations between simulation and
measured room temperatures and infiltration calcul;ations. 

 

 

This is totally separate to the Natural Ventilation Model, which includes
aperture opening size, wind speed, terrain category, etc

This is an area which we have some concern with and requires further
empirical validation.

Climate Zone has nothing to do with infiltration rates, except when in comes

As such, I would start to check your infiltration inputs to see what is

you'll find your answer somewhere there.

Also note that design infiltration rate and "actual, under operating
conditions" infiltration rate, are two different things. The average
constant infiltration rate is adequate enough for the later one.

Also, if you ever need to model a real infiltration from blower door test
results, I personnaly use the 50 Pa value divided by 20 for actual, normal
operation conditions, while the 75 Pa value would be divided by 35 (in
whatever units those values are provided).

I think the manual is a result of the many issues that were found during
review the projects. For our first few projects it was not available. Now of
course we use?

Currently there is a project CS 2.0 under review and one C&S 3.0 and one CI

1) If you are referring to  guidance on LEED building modeling, you might
consider the following manual
http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=7795
<http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=7795> 

2) While doing literature review for taking LEED NC v2.2, I remember that I
read somewhere that  one-hour conference call could be scheduled  (for a fee)
to provide an opportunity for direct dialog between reviewer and project's
design team responsible parties.  I am not sure and  you should check this
with GBCI.

Hope this helps.
Cheers, Sasa

Hi all!

 

Our problem is, that different reviewers want to see different things.

 

Our first project NC 2.2 Platinum was accepted without any clarification 3
years ago. For the next project, same version we used the same tool, model,
reports ? everything ? we needed two clarifications, had to pay extra money
etc. because of missing results, input files, report structure etc. Based on
this clarified project we did three more whole building simulation were we
got 20 ? 30 comments to clarify. 

 

Projects were all very much the same, so different systems can?t be the
reason. And due to the missing direct communication, it is sometimes hard to
get to know what the reviewer has in mind. 

 

We would appreciate 

-       more details about what is definitely necessary (nobody tells us, if
it is too much information), 

-       what is obsolete,

-       the same reviewer for earch project as far as possible because he is
familiar with the structure of documents etc

-       a way of direct communication after the first review?

 

Does somebody know how much time reviewers have for Minimum/Optimize Energy
Performance / how much money they get?

 

Regards Johannes

Betreff: [Bldg-sim] Suggestions for model reviews

 

Recently, I?ve had an odd string of personal contacts and strangers alike
confiding with me and demonstrating their frustrations over energy model
reviews.  As an outside-party, it?s actually largely entertaining to hear,
and puts a few things in perspective.  We are all human, and we all share
common emotions when put under the spotlight, but how we put those feelings
to action makes all the difference between an easy/productive review process
and a train wreck?

 

I?ve had the pleasure of treading both paths, and I thought it might be
helpful for modelers of all skill/experience levels to share a few tips I?ve
developed to manage the stress-level in your energy model reviews.  A few
reviewers out there might also benefit to turn this advice around and apply
it to their practices as well:

 

1.       Do not assume your reviewer knows less than you.  

a.       Recognize that stuff gets lost in translation ? energy modeling
minutiae are rarely easy to communicate in text format.

b.      It?s human to feel annoyed when your work is questioned, but practice
patience.  Odds are you and/or your reviewer are going to learn something as
a result. 

c.       If you ever catch yourself thinking/responding in a dismissive or
condescending fashion, stop.  Your heart is in the wrong place (however right
you might be) and you?re missing the point of an objective review.  Take a
breather!

2.       Do not assume your reviewer knows more than you, either.  

a.       Do not be afraid to challenge or question a query, but prepare and
present a solid case for any contrary position.  

b.      It is very easy to run yourself in circles trying to explain/justify
yourself when it isn?t really necessary.  

c.       Reviewers can and should make it plain when an in-depth explanation
is required.

3.       Be prepared to change your mind!  For better or for worse, reviews
are ultimately beneficial to all parties involved, because they provide an
excellent opportunity to learn a thing or two.  Allow your personal expertise
to continually evolve and incorporate, or at least recognize, others?
perspectives and practices.  They may serve you well personally in the
future!

4.       Once in a while, you may have to work with an individual who is
truly stubborn, unreasonable and is not willing to participate in any
objective discussion.  If a review should fail to ?close out? over such
behavior, the best you can hope for is to document communications so you can
later make apparent in hindsight that you were proactive, and pulling your
weight to move the process forward.  

 

If anyone has similar guiding principles or tips to share (from either side
of the reviewing fence), I think it would be much appreciated =)!

 

~Nick

Hi Aaron,

I also am unable to find a reference to the 25% process energy requirement.

For the tenant spaces with a lease agreement for the lighting power densities, I would use assumptions for space breakdowns, and then apply the lease agreement lighting power density reductions.  I also suggest listing these assumptions in the modeling report (or narrative).  To get an assumption of an office area breakdown, one way could be to build a quick eQUEST model of the office floor space, selecting "building type" as office in the wizard, then going into the detailed wizard to find the default space area breakdowns (80% office space, 5% washroom, 5% kitchen, etc).  I am not sure what the eQUEST default area breakdowns are based on, but that info may be available somewhere in the eQUEST documentation.

Also suggest you check the recent LEED Canada 2009 Supplementary Energy Modeling Guidelines document, available on the CaGBC website, under "Programs => LEED => Rating Systems => Core and Shell.

Good luck!

Hi,

I'm preparing a model for an office building for LEED Canada CS 2009.  Modelling is with EE4 following NRCan rules with an MNECB reference building.  Base building includes rooftop units, baseboard perimeter heat, core area with washrooms, electrical rooms, stairwells, elevators, etc.  One floor of the building has a ceiling in place with VAV boxes, diffusers and lights laid out for an open office plan (as laid out in the lease).  The other two floors of the building have VAV boxes installed as base building but the tenants will be responsible for installing lights or diffusers in tenant fit-ups.  Walls will probably be added and VAV boxes may need to change at that point in time.

I had the owner put requirements in the lease for lighting power density and lighting controls (Core Performance Guide) so I'll be claiming credit for those.  The problem I have is that there are no floor layouts indicating open office areas, private offices, conference rooms, staff rooms, etc. so I'm not sure what to use for reference building lighting power density and plug loads in the leased tenant areas.  My first thought for lighting was to use the building area method for the reference building then use a mix of actual installed lighting and Core Performance Guide lighting densities in the proposed assuming all open office plans for the tenant fit-up areas.  Any comments would be appreciated.

As a side note, I don't see any requirement in Canada for 25% of energy being process like there is in the US.

Thanks,
Aaron

Aaron & Lilah,
In its LEED 2012 draft, the USGBC replaced the 25% default process energy piece with more generic statements to model unregulated loads accurately and to document the assumptions.  GBCI reviewers have commented on specific internal load assumptions.
The ASHRAE 90.1 User's Manual, Title 24 NonRes ACM, and COMNET are also good sources for default internal loads.  I believe the COMNET workbook even puts them side by side.

The COMNET workbook Paul mentioned; I have recently been taking a good look
at it, have others started to adopt it into a work process for their
offices?
The authors have done a good job of layout out the modeling process and
workflow.

Message-ID: <134E0363C4FB6D41B4D6C665E1A90DAB1D0902@exchsvr01.atelierten.com>

HI All,

 

I am currently working on a project that involves many apartment blocks,
many of which do not have a typical floor plan. I am running an IES-VE
Energy model to ASHRAE standards for LEED NC submission and have a
particular query regarding the level of simplification that would be
acceptable for submission.

 

With regards to the HVAC system: I am assuming that the apartments will
have fan coil units conditioning the zones in the apartment, perhaps one
fan coil unit per two zones (bedrooms) in some cases. In order to
streamline the model I wish to enquire whether it would be acceptable to
group each apartment into one HVAC system with one cooling coil per
apartment, sized for the entire apartment. This in comparison to the
more time consuming method of

having a HVAC system for independent zones in each apartment. 

 

Effectively I wish to assign one HVAC system to each apartment, as
opposed to designating a HVAC to the independent zones. 

 

If anybody has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated.

 

Many Thanks

 

Ed

Dear Bldg-Sim Community:
As many of you are experiencing, there is a significant momentum and growing interest surrounding the retrofit performance of existing buildings (predicted performance vs. actual performance). Often, energy simulation predictions are used to drive retrofit investment decisions, for example priority selection of ECM's. And all too often, there are few mechanism or incentives for actual performance to be measured and compared to predicted performance, whether it be whole building, whole system, or component by component.

>From the financier's point of view, the importance of Measurement and Verification (M&V) activities as they relate to scenarios such as these cannot be understated.  As John Cowan, Chairman of the EVO Board, often repeats: "M&V is a strategy for establishing a culture of proof."

In an effort to increase the quantity and quality of Certified M&V practitioners available to the marketplace, Performance Systems Development will be offering a 3-day CMVP (Certified M&V Practitioner) course in Ithaca, NY in mid-September.  Details surrounding the course and related certification exam can be found here: http://www.psdconsulting.com/solutions/academy/courses/CMVP

John's presentation can be found here: http://www.evo-world.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=633&Itemid=375
All the Best,

I am trying to model a centralized water-to-water Heat Pumps System that provides hot water to distributed hybrid heat pumps (hybrid heat pump is fan coil in heating mode and heat pump in cooling mode). The hybrid heat pumps uses ground to reject heat when in cooling mode. The centralized water-to-water heat pumps provide chilled water for the make-up air units cooling coils. The Make-up air units heating coils are fed directly from the boiler. EE4 would not allow me to use a combination of these two systems. Does anyone have a work-around to this type of system. 
I would really appreciate any input in this regards.

Message-ID: <1312811664.64143.YahooMailNeo@web111815.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hello,
I am modeling a building with underfloor air distribution system to determine LEED credits. I am following the methodology suggested by Energy design resources where part of the load is applied to the plenum. The basecase system for the building is a standard VAV with reheat with all the loads applied to the space.
My question is if it is acceptable to have proposed case modeled with part of the load applied to the plenum while the base case has all the load applied to the space.
The only rule that I see being violated is the fact that the setpoint should be the same for the base and proposed case. While in the basecase the whole load is cooled to the setpoint, in the proposed case only part of the load is cooled to the setpoint while the rest is allowed to float.
?
Does anyone have any experience submitting an building with underfloor system to USGBC.
thanks
Raj

Ahmed,

 

The best recommendation that I can think of is to model this as a
"Combination Ground Source Heat Pump" Plant with a "4 pipe fan coil" System.
You will have to add the distributed heat pump cooling capacities to the
central heat pump cooling capacity and create a representative COP.  As you
can't model a boiler plant for the System heating, I'd recommend modeling
the heating as a Natural Gas or Oil Furnace.  System Cooling can be input as
Hydronic so chilled water will come from the central Water-to-water heat
pump plant.  NRCan may be willing to provide input as well even with the
ecoENERGY program ending this past spring.

 

As you know EE4 is not the most flexible simulation program, eQUEST might do
a better job if you are familiar with that software.


Regards,

Aaron

Subject: [Bldg-sim] simple multi-objective fitness function
Message-ID: <4E406205.4090400@gmail.com>

Probably slightly off topic but hoping someone interested in the topic 
can help me if interested in the topic.

I am running with E+ a daylighting simulation to optimise the shading 
device of a standard office building. Im using a single zone model for 
simplicity and shading devices are modelled as Shading:Zone:Detailed 
surfaces.

At the momento to optimise it Im running a GA which uses a fitness 
fucntion daylighting issues only. I wanted to keep my fitness function 
as simple as possible so I considered the uniformity ratio over my 
illumninance map grid. In this case my fitness function is F = Emax/Emin 
where Emax and Emin are respectivele the max and min illuminance values 
over the map grid.

Now I wanted to consider and possibly optimise my shading device 
according to other factors such as heating and cooling electricity 
demands. So I was thinking to calculate my new Objective function as MIN 
Zone Heating Load [J] + Zone Cooling Load [J] / Zone Load Target. This 
can be caclulated using the Zone,Meter,Heating:EnergyTransfer + 
Zone,Meter,Cooling:EnergyTransfer respectively.

Do you think this approach could be reasonable?

many thanks in advance

	Cisterns
Message-ID: <FD62F181C87B4080AE560D98D28532F3@MRENG.local>

Hi,

 

I'm putting together a LEED 2009 Submission and the rules now state that
"Both the baseline building model and the proposed model must cover all
building energy components." (pg. 286 of LEED Canada 2009).

 

I have no trouble including computer equipment, elevators and exterior
lights but we also have a rainwater cistern pump and electric vehicle
charging stations.  I'm not sure if the electric vehicles should be
considered "building energy components".  As well, both technologies
actually save energy elsewhere (gasoline/diesel and water utility pumping
power) so I don't think we should be penalized in our % energy cost savings
by adding these two energy uses to both reference model and proposed model.
Any thoughts on these?  

 

Cheers,

Aaron

Aaron,

I would think you would include these measures as an external load directly on the meter.  Each one individually is probably contributing to its own LEED point.  However, it does raise questions on how one could benchmark such measures.  For the electric vehicle charging stations, what if an on-site gas station was theorized as a base case?  Sounds like a lot of extra work, and what takes more energy to make, coal or gasoline?  Also, the rainwater pump is used for toilet rooms or for gardening?  Last I checked pumping energy to water flowers was not included, though I suppose it probably is not.

Hi,

I'm putting together a LEED 2009 Submission and the rules now state that "Both the baseline building model and the proposed model must cover all building energy components..." (pg. 286 of LEED Canada 2009).

I have no trouble including computer equipment, elevators and exterior lights but we also have a rainwater cistern pump and electric vehicle charging stations.  I'm not sure if the electric vehicles should be considered "building energy components".  As well, both technologies actually save energy elsewhere (gasoline/diesel and water utility pumping power) so I don't think we should be penalized in our % energy cost savings by adding these two energy uses to both reference model and proposed model.  Any thoughts on these?

Cheers,
Aaron

Aaron -

I agree with Kevin - my understanding is, if the load is served from the building meter and located within the LEED boundary, it should be included in the LEED model.

Both items would show up in the design and the baseline, as process energy consumers.

There is a tradeoff between water efficiency and energy efficiency that is made when a building decides to install its own water pressurization pumps. I'm not sure if your municipal water supply system has the controllability to reduce its water pressurization pumping energy based on your use of recovered water - but I haven't had the chance to work on those systems before, and I'm not sure how those systems are assembled.

If there are any efficiency measures on the rainwater pump that would be considered above "documented industry standard", you could look at documenting a reduction from the baseline via an Exceptional Calculation method.

That said, I imagine that the key thing for both loads would be determining a realistic schedule of use. You might find that the electric charging station in particular has a high peak power draw but a relatively low consumption, due to limited hours of use.

In line with Kevin's suggestion - if the electric vehicles are replacing fleet vehicles that would "traditionally" be sourced from another fuel, there may be an opportunity to claim a different baseline and show savings. But if they are just for visitors / employees, you might just use a baseline that is identical to your design.

Water pumps I see as a building system that could be included.  Other energy users related to plumbing would  be part of the building energy.

Electric vehicles though I think you could make a case for as an external load to the project subject to your ability to quantify the usage.  For example if you had a submeter and billed the fleet manager for the electricity I see this as a pass-through.

Without a submeter it might be harder to justify, as you'd never really know how much it was, and your subsequent utility bill reporting would include this energy.

Let me suggest a parallel - If there was a diesel tank on-site for fueling trucks it wouldn't be included.

But it would be tricky to document/report if that same tank fed the heating system, if you didn't log the usage for trucks.

I bring up the case of indoor electric vehicle 
charging stations such as one might find in a 
huge refrigerated warehouse - I toured a Loblaws 
facility.  The vehicles, batteries and charging 
systems were the latest and most efficient the 
designer could find.  The quote I heard was "20% 
more efficient, less heat, etc.".  The 
ventilation requirements for this type of 
vehicle/charging system are also less than for 
industry standard equipment.  Therefore, there 
are significant savings if there is a baseline 
for this equipment and I think the whole point of 
including such equipment would be to calculate 
the savings over industry standard and apply 
those savings as process energy credit.  At 
least, that is how I would make my case if I were submitting for LEED Canada.

Hi,

I am having issues related to setting up camera in Ecotect. Did anyone here have a problem with images getting rotated while visualizing through a wide angle camera?

Feel free to direct me to a more appropriate forum for Ecotect users. I just know of the Autodesk forum which is pretty inactive.

Thanks in advance,

Simple question (at least I think so), what day of the week does eQuest assume to start for Jan 1 (or which year)?  Does that hold for TMY3 data?

Hi Shubha,

I do not have Ecotect here, but as far as I know, it makes useage of 
Radiance. So if you are able to locate the view settings used when 
rendering the view, you can check the camera settings. Usually the 
extension of the view settings in Radiance is .vf, I would expect (or 
hope) that Ecotect keeps this.

There should be a line inside the view file containing lots of 
parameters starting with -v (all these are Radiance's view settings). If 
there is a string "-vu X Y Z" (X Y Z being a vector) you can correct the 
image alignment. The vector given here is the 3d vector in scene 
coordinates that will point towards the upper edge of the 2d image.

In most perspective views and sections, it is -vu 0 0 1 (as +z points up 
in the coordinate system used), while in a plan view with north being up 
it should be -vu 0 1 0.

Hope this helps. I have no idea about Ecotect support.

Cheers, Lars.

Ecotect is pretty bad in the visualization view, especially if you have a 
very detail model (or one that you imported from sketch up or Revit). I 
always have issues with my model not looking the way it really is.
See the attached example of a library I'm working on.

Hey Shubha,

I have that issue sometimes. Check the default tab in the visualize mode. If
that view is in plan, the camera angles rotate. You need to keep that view
in perspective. Hope this helps.

Hi, all? 
 
I?m simulating a project with chilled beam/radiator plus dedicated fresh air system, I search from archive, it seems most of you using DOAS (a dummy zone) and IU/FCU to simulate, DOAS provide the fresh air and IU/FCU use the ?Outdoor air from? DOAS, the radiator use baseboard instead with zero fan energy power.
 
But the DOAS in my project is 1) variable speed to reduce the fresh air energy base on occupancy schedule; 2) wheel heat recovery with exhaust air; 3) during the transition period, the DOAS will bypass the wheel to provide maximum fresh air to offset all the heating and cooling demand and chilled beam and radiator will shut off. 
 
Now, my method is : 
1)  using VAV system to represent DOAS , enter the ? Design supply/return ? flow to show the DOAS fresh air and exhaust air volume; 
2) Define the wheel heat recovery with fresh air and exhaust air, and operation control is ?OA exhaust DT?
3) Define the dummy with the same maximum fresh air volume, and also control the cool and heat temperature (otherwise the heat recovery will not work at all). 
It seems works very well. But when I reading hourly report, I found the fresh air volume keeps the maximum all the time, so the fan running at the rated power the whole year, which results in the large fan energy consumpation. 
How can I make the DOAS?s fresh air volume variable and fan variable according to the acutal IU/FC?s fresh air volume ??
Any comments and suggestions will be appreciated.

If you are using an active chilled beam, then you don't need to model the doas - just use 100% OA for your ahu.

When importing from Revit, line work is exaggerated in the visualization
tab as if it's weight is a diameter. That's what appears to be happening
in the images you've attached. 

 

I always keep the imported geometry on a separate Zone and move the
critical parts of the model needed in Ecotect (which shouldn't include
line work) onto new zones. You can toggle the line work zones off when
in visualization. 

 

Clunkly, but that's how Ecotect rolls with Revit.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Baseline system/plant for new campus buildings
Message-ID: <4E45020D020000930003B870@codex.archenergy.com>

Anyone,
For a project applying the 2005 "LEED NC App Guide for Multiple Buildings...." (AGMBC), I'm trying to determine the system/plant for the models of individual buildings on a new campus served by it's own new CUP. The results from these models are then to be averaged or aggregated into one PRM calculation for the project/campus. They also are used to document EAp2.
 
One suggestion I've been given is that the right approach for the proposed models is to scale down the characteristics of central plant for each of the building models. The baseline system/plants for the individual buildings would be determined by a standard application of the PRM for the building use/size. This seems similar to but not exactly the approach of Option 2 of the DES guide. Some old CIRs endorse this method for slightly different scenarios. It also seems that this would be the most appropriate way to "use a weighted average for the group of buildings based on their conditioned square footage, or aggregate the data into one PRM calculation," as the EAc1 section of the AGMBC instructs.
 
Can anyone confirm  this approach or offer an accepted alternative? If I can help it, I'd rather not wait for, or pay for an interpretation right now.
 
 
In the section for EAc1 Supplementary Guidance, the AGMBC states first that "the buildings are rated based upon the energy (and its cost) that crosses the building boundary," and then  that  "Calculation instructions for Version 2.1 and 2.2 will be supplied as supplements to the respective Reference Guides." I The only "calculation instructions," I can find are the "District Energy Guidelines." The current 2010 AGMBC does not address this at all. The use of buildings plural, and then building singular confuses me. Each "building" is served by CHW and steam, but the "buildings/project/campus) are served by electric and gas.
 
The DES guidelines apparently do not apply: Section 2.2 "Exception: When buildings are part of single LEED project, the CUP is a DES only if it is expected to serve other buildings not within the LEED project boundary." Since the project CUP serves only projects within the LEED project boundary, this CUP is apparently not a "DES" in LEED land.
 
Thank you

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Historical Weather Data for EnergyPlus
Message-ID: <4E455D1B.9020209@comcast.net>

Dear Sim List:

I'm attempting to calibrate an EnergyPlus / DesignBuilder model for an 
existing building using actual weather data.

I've downloaded data from the EnergyPlus website at:
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_request_options.cfm
for the three weather stations in the Minneapolis / St Paul area for 
2009 and 2010.

When I examine this data, there are about 70 days of data missing for 
2009 and about 20 days of data missing for 2010.
I have checked the option to "fill in missing time steps'; evidently 
these gaps are each too wide to be bridged with estimated data.
Even worse, the holes are virtually identical for all three weather 
stations in the Twin Cities area so that I don't have the option of 
creating a synthetic year from actual data from local stations.
EnergyPlus Support suggest that the weather stations may have been 
"taken down for maintenance".  It seems to me that taking down all the 
stations in a given area simultaneously is exactly what one wouldn't 
want to do.

Can anyone shed any light on this ?  Any ideas for other sources of 
hourly TMY2 or TMY3 data for this area ?

Thanks,
Dave

If the gaps are more than a day, I don't think that NREL fills it (near
real-time weather data providers).   You can get data from NCDC as well:
www.ncdc.noaa.gov .  When I just checked for MSP, they have data up until
early August 2011.  As far as the number of hours available in each month,
they show:


726580 14922 MINNEAPOLIS/ST.PAUL            2009 1055  957 1053  997
925  990  963 1052  903 1262  944 1198
726580 14922 MINNEAPOLIS/ST.PAUL            2010 1098 1047 1027  897
998 1074 1003  983 1008  957 1065 1224
726580 14922 MINNEAPOLIS/ST.PAUL            2011 1270 1044 1213 1144
1067 1111 1097  330    0    0    0    0


Total Surface Hourly Observations Available: 32956
Total Station-Years: 3


Yes, there are missing data but I don't see anything as long as you're
talking about.  When I requested this data, NCDC put a price of $40 on it.
The specific data set is:  DS3505 - Surface Data, Hourly Global.

David,

We just finished (last 2 hours) our system for integrating NOAA reanalysis data with ground station observations & it is up right now.  If you pick a weather station location the system will intelligently fill in all gaps in its observations and if you just pick your specific site away from a station, it will use the closest weather station to localize the 35 km resolution reanalysis output from NOAA.  Either way you can get the full actual year of hourly weather data for 2009 (or any other year you want up thru 2010) or a 30 year TMY.  Note 2011 is coming next week.  BTW the data is delivered in csv and also in epw., .bin, and .tm2 formats.  It is $75 but will save you potentially a lot of work/hassel. Direct link = http://wxaglobal.com/GetWeatherData.html

Hope this helps,  Chuck

All chilled beam systems that I have worked on have 100% OA so there is no recirculation. Not sure I understand the point about needing to recirculate air back to balance the system and control RH. With the DOAS - you control dew point so there shouldn't be a problem. As far as I know the only condensation issues occur with passive beams (as opposed to the active beams that are really induction units).

Since the chilled water coils don't really see the supply air, but see room air (its only the induced air that flows over the coils) I would recommend checking the room functions before going to chilled beams. If there is a high latent load in the space, it might not be the best option.

Hello Eleanor,
Adding to Vikram's advice -- You may then also apply the heat recovery to the individual IU units instead of the DOAS.

But, an important question for experts who may be experienced with working real-life Chilled Beam systems is --

Whether or not the OA moved through the active chilled beams is completely (100%) Outside Air only OR Whether some of the supply air is still recirculated?
I presume it'll depend on latent loads but I understand that for most occupied zones some air is actually recirculated back to the AHU's to control the RH and balance the system!?
Please correct me if that is any different from anyone's real-life experience and what Vikram is referring to is the experience you all share? Vikram, your veiws?
We are modeling a couple of chilled beam and slab systems but with little live examples and experiences to corroborate on this aspect.

Your inputs would be valuable . . . .
Thanks,
Neeraj

Subject:        [Bldg-sim] DOAS and chilled beam/radiator

Hi, all?

I?m simulating a project with chilled beam/radiator plus dedicated fresh air system, I search from archive, it seems most of you using DOAS (a dummy zone) and IU/FCU to simulate, DOAS provide the fresh air and IU/FCU use the ?Outdoor air from? DOAS, the radiator use baseboard instead with zero fan energy power.

But the DOAS in my project is 1) variable speed to reduce the fresh air energy base on occupancy schedule; 2) wheel heat recovery with exhaust air; 3) during the transition period, the DOAS will bypass the wheel to provide maximum fresh air to offset all the heating and cooling demand and chilled beam and radiator will shut off.

Now, my method is :

1)  using VAV system to represent DOAS , enter the ? Design supply/return ? flow to show the DOAS fresh air and exhaust air volume;

2) Define the wheel heat recovery with fresh air and exhaust air, and operation control is ?OA exhaust DT?

3) Define the dummy with the same maximum fresh air volume, and also control the cool and heat temperature (otherwise the heat recovery will not work at all).

It seems works very well. But when I reading hourly report, I found the fresh air volume keeps the maximum all the time, so the fan running at the rated power the whole year, which results in the large fan energy consumpation.

How can I make the DOAS?s fresh air volume variable and fan variable according to the acutal IU/FC?s fresh air volume ??

Any comments and suggestions will be appreciated.

Hi, Neeraj and Vikram: 
 
Thanks for your promote advice. I'm reading DOE22Vol3-Topics.these days and found that IU's one application is just ceiling radiator .
 
Now, I have changed my system type to IU system with no separate MAU systems, but I still have two puzzles :
1) The fan control is gray which means you can't choose variable, so is it says that the fan is running the full power all the time?
2) How to define the induction ratio and make it reasonable? I'm not sure whether the recirculating air volume will affect the fan power. it seems not. 
 
And another question is about water economizer? Can we simulate water economizer now?
For eQUEST 3.64, there are two methods, one is the water economizer in airside system, but the weakness of this water economizer is it will add the AHU fan power.
The other one is the water economizer chiller in waterside system, but it seems the function is not matural, I tried , but the hourly report shows the chillers still running in the winter for very low cooling load. 
 
Thanks in advance. 
Eleanor Shen

Eleanor,


1.       In my experience - active chilled beams typically operate at constant volume (set to the ventilation rate in the room) and you vary the cooling rate with a 3-way valve on the cooling coil to vary the cooling capacity of the beam.

2.       Different beam designs have different induction ratios ?C I would look up the manufacturers data. The typical range is around 3-6.

3.       Yes ?C you can simulate a WSE now ?C you need to add a chiller and select waterside economizer as chiller type. Not sure why your example is not working ?C if you attach an inp file I??m sure someone can shed some light no that.

Hi, Neeraj and Vikram:

Thanks for your promote advice. I'm reading DOE22Vol3-Topics.these days and found that IU's one application is just ceiling radiator .

Now, I have changed my system type to IU system with no separate MAU systems, but I still have two puzzles :
1) The fan control is gray which means you can't choose variable, so is it says that the fan is running the full power all the time?
2) How to define the induction ratio and make it reasonable? I'm not sure whether the recirculating air volume will affect the fan power. it seems not.

And another question is about water economizer? Can we simulate water economizer now?
For eQUEST 3.64, there are two methods, one is the water economizer in airside system, but the weakness of this water economizer is it will add the AHU fan power.
The other one is the water economizer chiller in waterside system, but it seems the function is not matural, I tried , but the hourly report shows the chillers still running in the winter for very low cooling load.

Thanks in advance.
Eleanor Shen

Hello Eleanor,
Adding to Vikram's advice -- You may then also apply the heat recovery to the individual IU units instead of the DOAS.

But, an important question for experts who may be experienced with working real-life Chilled Beam systems is --

Whether or not the OA moved through the active chilled beams is completely (100%) Outside Air only OR Whether some of the supply air is still recirculated?
I presume it'll depend on latent loads but I understand that for most occupied zones some air is actually recirculated back to the AHU's to control the RH and balance the system!?
Please correct me if that is any different from anyone's real-life experience and what Vikram is referring to is the experience you all share? Vikram, your veiws?
We are modeling a couple of chilled beam and slab systems but with little live examples and experiences to corroborate on this aspect.

Your inputs would be valuable . . . .
Thanks,
Neeraj

Hi, all??



I??m simulating a project with chilled beam/radiator plus dedicated fresh air system, I search from archive, it seems most of you using DOAS (a dummy zone) and IU/FCU to simulate, DOAS provide the fresh air and IU/FCU use the ??Outdoor air from?? DOAS, the radiator use baseboard instead with zero fan energy power.



But the DOAS in my project is 1) variable speed to reduce the fresh air energy base on occupancy schedule; 2) wheel heat recovery with exhaust air; 3) during the transition period, the DOAS will bypass the wheel to provide maximum fresh air to offset all the heating and cooling demand and chilled beam and radiator will shut off.



Now, my method is :



1)  using VAV system to represent DOAS , enter the ?? Design supply/return ?? flow to show the DOAS fresh air and exhaust air volume;



2) Define the wheel heat recovery with fresh air and exhaust air, and operation control is ??OA exhaust DT??



3) Define the dummy with the same maximum fresh air volume, and also control the cool and heat temperature (otherwise the heat recovery will not work at all).



It seems works very well. But when I reading hourly report, I found the fresh air volume keeps the maximum all the time, so the fan running at the rated power the whole year, which results in the large fan energy consumpation.



How can I make the DOAS??s fresh air volume variable and fan variable according to the acutal IU/FC??s fresh air volume ??



Any comments and suggestions will be appreciated.

Eleanor,

I??ll add to the conversation.  I would agree with Vikram in that most chilled beam projects tend to be designed with constant volume primary air.  It simplifies the design and helps to reduce first cost.  If you do want to pursue VAV primary air then you (or the project engineer) should speak with the vendors you??re considering to see how the beams perform at lower airflows (especially if you??re expecting to get capacity from the beam when doing so).

Regarding 100% OA or RA, this decision has to consider a few things.  First, one has to acknowledge that the capacity of the beam per its given length is, among other things, dependant on the amount of primary being supplied to it.   Often this primary air cfm is greater than the minimum ventilation air needed, especially pronounced in perimeter spaces if loads are not minimized well.

Second, as was discussed in this string, the primary air must be capable of addressing the latent loads in the space.  Depending on your method of dehumidification (i.e. typical cooling coil, desiccant wheel, etc.), this may be a challenge with minimum ventilation airflow.  You??ll need to consider how much primary air is needed.  If you find that more than the Min OA is needed, then you??ll need to increase accordingly.

After you consider these two aspects, the primary airflow needed for achieving desired cooling capacity and the latent capacity of the primary air, then you??ll need to evaluate the energy implications of at 100% OA vs. RA system.  You may find that you need a volume of primary air 2-3 times the OA needed,  thus doubling or tripling the amount of OA that is being conditioned if you choose the 100% OA approach.  Depending on climate and any airside energy recovery device, this can have a dramatic impact on energy consumption.

You asked some good questions. I??d encourage you to work closely with the engineers doing the design so that you can talk through some of these items.

Good luck.

One VAV approach that I've seen used successfully for larger chilled beam
spaces (open offices, conference rooms for instance) that have DVC is to
have VAV controls on the air handler supplying the chilled beams, and have
air valves that shut off primary air to a portion of the chilled beams in
the space when CO2, cooling, and heating needs for the space are all being
met, and throttle back the supply and return fans to match the reduction in
air volume.  Modeling to account for the reduction in air volume was done
thru post-processing hourly reports.

Subject:        [Bldg-sim] DOAS and chilled beam/radiator
 
Hi, all??
 
I??m simulating a project with chilled beam/radiator plus dedicated fresh
air system, I search from archive, it seems most of you using DOAS (a dummy
zone) and IU/FCU to simulate, DOAS provide the fresh air and IU/FCU use the
??Outdoor air from?? DOAS, the radiator use baseboard instead with zero fan
energy power.
 
But the DOAS in my project is 1) variable speed to reduce the fresh air
energy base on occupancy schedule; 2) wheel heat recovery with exhaust air;
3) during the transition period, the DOAS will bypass the wheel to provide
maximum fresh air to offset all the heating and cooling demand and chilled
beam and radiator will shut off.
 
Now, my method is :
 
1)  using VAV system to represent DOAS , enter the ?? Design supply/return
?? flow to show the DOAS fresh air and exhaust air volume;
 
2) Define the wheel heat recovery with fresh air and exhaust air, and
operation control is ??OA exhaust DT??
 
3) Define the dummy with the same maximum fresh air volume, and also control
the cool and heat temperature (otherwise the heat recovery will not work at
all).
 
It seems works very well. But when I reading hourly report, I found the
fresh air volume keeps the maximum all the time, so the fan running at the
rated power the whole year, which results in the large fan energy
consumpation.
 
How can I make the DOAS??s fresh air volume variable and fan variable
according to the acutal IU/FC??s fresh air volume ??
 
Any comments and suggestions will be appreciated.

Colleagues

 

I wanted to mention another difference between ACBs and any other ??conventional?? system.

Specific fan power (W/L/s) can be significantly higher that that for traditional systems as the process to create induction ratios depends on static pressure in the beam??s chamber. 

This requires extra energy as the ACB does not just deliver OA to the room; it is supposed to entrain another 3-5 air volumes through heat exchanger.... 

Unfortunately, manufacturers of the ACBs do no like to mention this fact when list ACB??s advantages.

 

Cheers

Eleanor,

 

1.       In my experience - active chilled beams typically operate at constant volume (set to the ventilation rate in the room) and you vary the cooling rate with a 3-way valve on the cooling coil to vary the cooling capacity of the beam. 

2.       Different beam designs have different induction ratios ?C I would look up the manufacturers data. The typical range is around 3-6.

3.       Yes ?C you can simulate a WSE now ?C you need to add a chiller and select waterside economizer as chiller type. Not sure why your example is not working ?C if you attach an inp file I??m sure someone can shed some light no that.

Hi, Neeraj and Vikram: 
 
Thanks for your promote advice. I'm reading DOE22Vol3-Topics.these days and found that IU's one application is just ceiling radiator .
 
Now, I have changed my system type to IU system with no separate MAU systems, but I still have two puzzles :

1) The fan control is gray which means you can't choose variable, so is it says that the fan is running the full power all the time?

2) How to define the induction ratio and make it reasonable? I'm not sure whether the recirculating air volume will affect the fan power. it seems not. 

 

And another question is about water economizer? Can we simulate water economizer now?

For eQUEST 3.64, there are two methods, one is the water economizer in airside system, but the weakness of this water economizer is it will add the AHU fan power.

The other one is the water economizer chiller in waterside system, but it seems the function is not matural, I tried , but the hourly report shows the chillers still running in the winter for very low cooling load. 

 

Thanks in advance. 

Eleanor Shen

Hello Eleanor,
Adding to Vikram's advice -- You may then also apply the heat recovery to the individual IU units instead of the DOAS.

But, an important question for experts who may be experienced with working real-life Chilled Beam systems is --

Whether or not the OA moved through the active chilled beams is completely (100%) Outside Air only OR Whether some of the supply air is still recirculated?
I presume it'll depend on latent loads but I understand that for most occupied zones some air is actually recirculated back to the AHU's to control the RH and balance the system!?
Please correct me if that is any different from anyone's real-life experience and what Vikram is referring to is the experience you all share? Vikram, your veiws?
We are modeling a couple of chilled beam and slab systems but with little live examples and experiences to corroborate on this aspect.

Your inputs would be valuable . . . .
Thanks,
Neeraj

This is true - there is often an increase in static pressure with a chilled beam system.

However


in some cases - you more than make up for that by the reduced quantities of supply air. If you can drop your air change rate from 10-15 ACH down to 6ACH you come out ahead.

Like everything else - you have to do the analysis to make sure it makes sense. It often does.

But LEED requires all the supply flow and HVAC equipment capacity strictly base on the actual design. So most of my projects I will simulate using the design parameters as possible as I can. 
According to DOE document, uisng UI system to simulate cooling beam, the suggested pressure drop is only 1.0~1.5 in. water. In fact the fresh air unit with wheel heat recovery will at least have a press drop about 1000Pa.
If I use the actual parameter, the fan energy very be huge. How do you deal with this situation? 
 
Best regards!

Dear Sami

Absolutely agree with you regarding some apparent advantages of the ACB technology. Just wanted to mention several issues that are extremely important.

Data regarding ACBs static pressure that is usually provided by the manufacturers and fan capacity needed are absolutely different things. 

Main difference between the full-air and ACB systems is that in the full-air system the dynamic pressure is mainly not converted (partially) to static pressure on the whole path up to the discharge grille (diffuser). This process is well understood by the designers and pressure drop in the ducts or on filters (index run), etc is accounted for to match capacity of the fan. 
ACB's technology needs the air being capable of doing ??entrainment?? job. This requires application of some extra energy to this air (pressurising this air). 

Manufacturers of the ACB do not bother to consider how the whole system including ducts and plenums behave, assuming that the duct is ??working?? as a regular duct and that the dynamic pressure is converted to static pressure in the plenum (and nowhere else). Usually ACB??s ??plenums?? are not working properly as plenums and the conversion of the static pressure does not happen in the ??plenums?? (this is a desirable, but not achievable process). Being blocked by the ACB units the whole duct system starts working as a plenum (pressure vessel) itself. 

Probably customers who have installed the ACBs experienced increased static pressure in their duct system and some issues to achieve the required by pressure specified by the ACB's manufacture. 
This pressure increase results in the increased leaks through the tiny wholes and cracks in the ducts, ACB units, etc ?C and this is extra noise, lost capacity and a number of other issues. The customers are trying to achieve the static pressure in the plenums and jump on the AHU??s fan that is working on the full capacity and can not achieve the desired flow....

Just to summarise the provided information I would say that the ACB??s technology is living technology, nothing here is with ??magic?? as some of the manufacturers wish to present. It has a number of advantages, though many disadvantages must be also recognised when designing the ACB system. The main attention should be paid to the fan and the duct system and reasonable questions addressed to the manufacturers of the ACBs.

Cheers

Sergey

This is true - there is often an increase in static pressure with a chilled beam system.

However


in some cases - you more than make up for that by the reduced quantities of supply air. If you can drop your air change rate from 10-15 ACH down to 6ACH you come out ahead.

Like everything else - you have to do the analysis to make sure it makes sense. It often does.

Colleagues

I wanted to mention another difference between ACBs and any other ??conventional?? system.
Specific fan power (W/L/s) can be significantly higher that that for traditional systems as the process to create induction ratios depends on static pressure in the beam??s chamber.
This requires extra energy as the ACB does not just deliver OA to the room; it is supposed to entrain another 3-5 air volumes through heat exchanger....
Unfortunately, manufacturers of the ACBs do no like to mention this fact when list ACB??s advantages.

Hi, Neeraj and Vikram:

Thanks for your promote advice. I'm reading DOE22Vol3-Topics.these days and found that IU's one application is just ceiling radiator .

Now, I have changed my system type to IU system with no separate MAU systems, but I still have two puzzles :
1) The fan control is gray which means you can't choose variable, so is it says that the fan is running the full power all the time?
2) How to define the induction ratio and make it reasonable? I'm not sure whether the recirculating air volume will affect the fan power. it seems not.

And another question is about water economizer? Can we simulate water economizer now?
For eQUEST 3.64, there are two methods, one is the water economizer in airside system, but the weakness of this water economizer is it will add the AHU fan power.
The other one is the water economizer chiller in waterside system, but it seems the function is not matural, I tried , but the hourly report shows the chillers still running in the winter for very low cooling load.

Thanks in advance.

Hello Eleanor,
Adding to Vikram's advice -- You may then also apply the heat recovery to the individual IU units instead of the DOAS.

But, an important question for experts who may be experienced with working real-life Chilled Beam systems is --

Whether or not the OA moved through the active chilled beams is completely (100%) Outside Air only OR Whether some of the supply air is still recirculated?
I presume it'll depend on latent loads but I understand that for most occupied zones some air is actually recirculated back to the AHU's to control the RH and balance the system!?
Please correct me if that is any different from anyone's real-life experience and what Vikram is referring to is the experience you all share? Vikram, your veiws?
We are modeling a couple of chilled beam and slab systems but with little live examples and experiences to corroborate on this aspect.

Your inputs would be valuable . . . .

Subject:        [Bldg-sim] DOAS and chilled beam/radiator



Hi, all??



I??m simulating a project with chilled beam/radiator plus dedicated fresh air system, I search from archive, it seems most of you using DOAS (a dummy zone) and IU/FCU to simulate, DOAS provide the fresh air and IU/FCU use the ??Outdoor air from?? DOAS, the radiator use baseboard instead with zero fan energy power.



But the DOAS in my project is 1) variable speed to reduce the fresh air energy base on occupancy schedule; 2) wheel heat recovery with exhaust air; 3) during the transition period, the DOAS will bypass the wheel to provide maximum fresh air to offset all the heating and cooling demand and chilled beam and radiator will shut off.



Now, my method is :



1)  using VAV system to represent DOAS , enter the ?? Design supply/return ?? flow to show the DOAS fresh air and exhaust air volume;



2) Define the wheel heat recovery with fresh air and exhaust air, and operation control is ??OA exhaust DT??



3) Define the dummy with the same maximum fresh air volume, and also control the cool and heat temperature (otherwise the heat recovery will not work at all).



It seems works very well. But when I reading hourly report, I found the fresh air volume keeps the maximum all the time, so the fan running at the rated power the whole year, which results in the large fan energy consumpation.



How can I make the DOAS??s fresh air volume variable and fan variable according to the acutal IU/FC??s fresh air volume ??



Any comments and suggestions will be appreciated.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DOAS with ERV
Message-ID: <CAHpz=HRaXbPSat6XMXGu4xdWqYZn8o068Vavc=ypVTeuRftwdw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
          I am getting increase in cooling energy consumption(almost
double)  after adding heat recovery wheel to my DOAS system. I can
understand this mystery.  Is there any specific procedure of adding
ERV to the DOAS system (here i have taken PSZ as DOAS) with OA Ratio
as 1.


I look for your valuable response

Thanks
Sambhav .

I'm curious how everyone is handling the OA for Appendix G simulations when
using a DOAS in the proposed system.  We have a design that is DOAS + FCU
with a  total OA of 8,000 CFM.  When you run the OA calcs for this same
building with a VAV system (the baseline), the total OA required to meet
Standard 62 is 39,000 CFM.  This difference in OA represents a significant
energy savings (in climate zone 4A), yet Appendix G requires the OA volumes
to match.  It does not seem "fair" to me that the proposed case cannot take
credit for design choice when it comes to OA.  I feel like Appendix G should
make an exception for DOAS.  Am I missing something?  Is there a way around
this?  Any thoughts are appreciated!

Dear Anne,

I'm not sure why you think the OA requirement varies by system.  I'm not
well versed in Standard 62, but my basic understanding is that one of the
calculation methods is the result of building area and number of occupants.
Those are unchanged by system selection . which is why it makes sense for
Appendix G to require matching volumes.

The critical zone fraction as explained by ASHRAE 62.1 will, in most cases, increase outside air intake in a VAV system.  This is due to the need for the entire system to increase its outside air fraction if one zone's airflow dips to its minimum VAV airflow.  To maintain the ventilation fraction in the one zone that reduced airflow, the entire system ingests large amounts of outside air to make sure it gets enough air to that particular zone.

It's a bit more complicated than that, but that's the simplest explanation.  There are ways around it, but it takes time to 'correct' for small, high ventilation-fraction areas that tend to drive the system towards high ventilation rates when they modulate to minimum position.

Hope this makes sense.

Michael alludes to the system ventilation efficiency (E_v).  Per ASHRAE 62, It and the zone air distribution effectiveness (E_z) vary based on system configuration.
When ASHRAE 90.1 says the minimum outdoor air must match I take that to mean the base R_p and R_a values not necessarily the resultant V_ot values.  Similarly when LEED says DCV must be compared against the minimum ASHRAE values I take that to mean R_p and R_a values as well.
I assert that it is appropriate to calculate separate E_v and E_z values for the each system in baseline and proposed models, which  can lead to ASHRAE 62 multi-zone calculations for the baseline systems.

Paul - I took the same approach, and my LEED reviewer shot it down.  I
didn't explain it, though, so that may be why.  Have you had success with a
LEED review and your approach?  If so, did you have to explain it or did you
just provide the calcs that prove it?  Thanks!

Just to give some perspective on how ventilation will likely 
be handled in future versions of LEED. Here is the text from 
the 90.1-2010 section on ventilation.

Jason

----------------------

G3.1.2.6 Ventilation. Minimum ventilation system outdoor air 
intake flow shall be the same for the proposed and baseline 
building designs.

Exceptions:

a. When modeling demand-control ventilation in the proposed 
design when its use is not required by Section 6.3.2(p) or 
Section 6.4.3.9.

b. When designing systems in accordance with Standard 62.1 
Section 6.2 Ventilation Rate Procedure, reduced ventilation 
airflow rates may be calculated for each HVAC zone in the 
proposed design with a zone air distribution effectiveness 
(Ez) > 1.0 as defined by Table 6-2 in Standard 62.1. 
Baseline ventilation airflow rates in those zones shall be 
calculated using the proposed design Ventilation Rate 
Procedure calculation with the following change only. Zone 
air distribution effectiveness shall be changed to (Ez)=1.0 
in each zone having a zone air distribution effectiveness 
(Ez)>1.0. Proposed design and baseline design Ventilation 
Rate Procedure calculations, as described in Standard 62.1, 
shall be submitted to the rating authority to claim credit 
for this exception.

c. If the minimum outdoor air intake flow in the proposed 
design is provided in excess of the amount required by the 
rating authority or building official then the baseline 
building design shall be modeled to reflect the greater of 
that required by the rating authority or building official 
and will be less than the proposed design.

Anyone can organize an IBPSA affiliate-what you need to do is simple:

1.       Have an organizing meeting

2.       Select officers

3.       Establish the organization (objectives, goals, any legal requirements)

4.       Make a proposal to IBPSA Board (more information required but similar).

All this information is on the IBPSA web site www.ibpsa.org<http://www.ibpsa.org> .   Look under Affiliates.

Hello,

I agree. Here in Portugal there are a large number of people who are working in simulation, and IBPSA here in Portugal would be very helpful, helping to develop simulation.

Thank you

Hy Dru Crawley,

Here in Portugal we are still waiting for IBPSA. I think Victor Leal, the person that you have indicated for the in charge for the IBPSA Portugal are in other planning.

For how long to include Portugal in the way.

A LEED reviewer has acknowledged improved zone effectiveness for our true displacement ventilation system with separate perimeter heating such that the supply air was always sufficiently cool.  I did it as an exceptional calculation because I knew they would pick at it.  The documentation was a bit complicated because Proposed must match Proposed, so my exception calculation was actually for a baseline' model with lower Ev values and higher resultant Vot values.  Of course, no guarantees from USGBC about future reviews.
A DOAS system could involve claiming improved E_v and/or E_z and I concede that I have not made E_v improvement claims to LEED.  But if I thought it would affect my building's rating then I definitely would state my case.  Let's remember that while the Ch 11 ECB method couples each proposed system to a baseline system, Appendix G does not.  I have an Appendix G LEED project where we used one AHU to serve a two story building but per Appendix G it is an AHU per floor.  So one proposed AHU, two baseline AHUs and potentially three different E_v values. 
Thanks to Jason for highlighting that excerpt.  Ventilation standards are complex in their own right but now that the energy standard specifically references them it is going to get even more fascinatingly complex.

Just to give some perspective on how ventilation will likely be handled in future versions of LEED. Here is the text from the 90.1-2010 section on ventilation.

Jason

----------------------

G3.1.2.6 Ventilation. Minimum ventilation system outdoor air intake flow shall be the same for the proposed and baseline building designs.

Exceptions:

a. When modeling demand-control ventilation in the proposed design when its use is not required by Section 6.3.2(p) or Section 6.4.3.9.

b. When designing systems in accordance with Standard 62.1 Section 6.2 Ventilation Rate Procedure, reduced ventilation airflow rates may be calculated for each HVAC zone in the proposed design with a zone air distribution effectiveness
(Ez) > 1.0 as defined by Table 6-2 in Standard 62.1. 
Baseline ventilation airflow rates in those zones shall be calculated using the proposed design Ventilation Rate Procedure calculation with the following change only. Zone air distribution effectiveness shall be changed to (Ez)=1.0 in each zone having a zone air distribution effectiveness (Ez)>1.0. Proposed design and baseline design Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations, as described in Standard 62.1, shall be submitted to the rating authority to claim credit for this exception.

c. If the minimum outdoor air intake flow in the proposed design is provided in excess of the amount required by the rating authority or building official then the baseline building design shall be modeled to reflect the greater of that required by the rating authority or building official and will be less than the proposed design.

Hi,

 

I am confused about Area mentioned in ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G, Table G3.1.1A
Building Type area is conditioned or unconditioned?

 

ASHRAE clearly says in Table G3.1.3.7 that area is conditioned but above
table it doesn't specify.

 

If it is conditioned, suppose if I have building with area of 150,000 sqft
with only 10% of conditioned, then do I need to choose System 6? It's
difficulty to have savings.

 

Thanks in advance.

Ashraf

Ashraf,

 

As per ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G, Table G.3.1.1A Building Type area is
conditioned. Refer Section G.3.1.1 Baseline HVAC System Type and
Description.

 

In your Case,

 

If conditioned area 15,000 ft? (150,000 ft? with only 10% of conditioned),
If Non residential and 3 floors or less and <25,000 ft? accordingly you can
select System 3 or 4.

 

If conditioned area 15,000 ft? (150,000 ft? with only 10% of conditioned),
If Non residential and 4 or 5 floors and <25,000 ft? or 5 floors or Less and
25,000ft? to 150,000 ft? accordingly you can select System 5 or 6.

Anne,

While LEED/ASHRAE 90.1 requires the ventilation rates to be the same in 
both the Baseline and Proposed systems, the calculated difference for 
the two systems is much higher than expected. Suggest taking another 
look at the calculations and confirming that the critical zone for the 
VAV system has been properly determined and whether appropriate factors 
for the zone air distribution effectiveness (Ez) and system ventilation 
efficiency (Ev) have been applied.

Look at this paper -
http://www.ibpsa.us/pub/simbuild2010/papers/SB10-DOC-TS03A-02-Gagne.pdf
Jamie Gagne gave a demonstration of the program developed at MIT to
suggest optimum window size + shading + glazing combination. It was pretty
cool. All you need to input is the sketch up block geometry and specify
illumination and glare criteria.
I am not sure about the commercial availability of this though.

Hope this helps

Message-ID: <CAAkkLHGjNFQ9pMN-rz_raD0=A4ySoKmeRiLzDpkiwJckK5gQuw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am trying to take credit for better part load performance of a chiller by
modifying the EIR_FLRP curve.  I am using the curve-fit feature in eQuest to
fit to the raw data and then inserting it into the DOE file ( I am using
EE4).  The chiller should have better performance than the default, but my
results seem to disagree as my cooling energy doubles.  Am I missing
something? My resulting co-efficient are :
a=1.16801012,b=-1.92066431,c=1.75265419.

The chiller data is as follows

Hi,

As per ASHRAE 90.1-2004 , Table G.3.1.1.A Clearly metions that , 1) For
residential Buildings a) If the heating source is provided then the system
would be 1 (PTAC) , and if b) there is no heating provided or no hetaing
energy source is specified , use Electric and other source classification ,
and according to that our system would be (PTAC HP) system 2.

2) If it is non residential and having 3 floors or less than that and less
than 75,000 Sq ft of conditioned area then our System would be SYSTEM no 3 ,
b) if there is no heating mentioned then
SYSTEM no. 4.

same for other cases.

While I don't intend to discuss the merits of VAV systems and know I'm
part of a minority in that area, this is exactly why DOAS systems are
being explored more right now on the research side (take for example the
number of ASHRAE Journal articles on the topic over the past few years).
Without seeing your OA calcs I would also agree that the difference is
more than I would expect between the two systems, but I'm more inclined
to think the DOAS might be a bit low if it is being used in conjunction
with FCUs.  VAV systems are typically underventilated due to two common
mistakes in the calculations: not analyzing with the correct Ez and not
using the minimum expected primary airflow for design purposes (refer to
ASHRAE 62.1-2007 Section 6.2.5.1, specifically the note in that
section).  When fixing these two typical mistakes in calculations
without optimizing the primary airflow rates, I typically see OA
requirements double from the incorrectly calculated values.

 

This situation is a good example of when to do one of two things
(possibly both together)

1.       If this is a LEED project, submit a project-specific CIR

2.       Use section ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Section 2.5 Exceptional
Calculation Methodology to get around the requirement and document the
energy savings from reduced OA requirements for a DOAS system.

Anne,

While LEED/ASHRAE 90.1 requires the ventilation rates to be the same in
both the Baseline and Proposed systems, the calculated difference for
the two systems is much higher than expected. Suggest taking another
look at the calculations and confirming that the critical zone for the
VAV system has been properly determined and whether appropriate factors
for the zone air distribution effectiveness (Ez) and system ventilation
efficiency (Ev) have been applied.

I'm curious how everyone is handling the OA for Appendix G simulations
when using a DOAS in the proposed system.  We have a design that is DOAS
+ FCU with a  total OA of 8,000 CFM.  When you run the OA calcs for this
same building with a VAV system (the baseline), the total OA required to
meet Standard 62 is 39,000 CFM.  This difference in OA represents a
significant energy savings (in climate zone 4A), yet Appendix G requires
the OA volumes to match.  It does not seem "fair" to me that the
proposed case cannot take credit for design choice when it comes to OA.
I feel like Appendix G should make an exception for DOAS.  Am I missing
something?  Is there a way around this?  Any thoughts are appreciated!

System type is determined from conditioned floor area (Section, not table, G3.1.1).  

 

Note:  you cannot choose to not heat a conditioned space, even if no heating system is to be installed.  See Table G3.1, sub-section (1.), and reference the glossary to determine what is and isn't a "conditioned space" in such context.  

 

Per Sadaf below, any such non-installed systems are to be modeled as the "Electric and Other" equivalent - referencing the sub-notes of Table G.3.1.1.A.

Ashraf,

 

As per ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G, Table G.3.1.1A Building Type area is conditioned. Refer Section G.3.1.1 Baseline HVAC System Type and Description.

 

In your Case,

 

If conditioned area 15,000 ft? (150,000 ft? with only 10% of conditioned), If Non residential and 3 floors or less and <25,000 ft? accordingly you can select System 3 or 4.

 

If conditioned area 15,000 ft? (150,000 ft? with only 10% of conditioned), If Non residential and 4 or 5 floors and <25,000 ft? or 5 floors or Less and 25,000ft? to 150,000 ft? accordingly you can select System 5 or 6.

Hi,

 

I am confused about Area mentioned in ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G, Table G3.1.1A Building Type area is conditioned or unconditioned?

 

ASHRAE clearly says in Table G3.1.3.7 that area is conditioned but above table it doesn't specify.

 

If it is conditioned, suppose if I have building with area of 150,000 sqft with only 10% of conditioned, then do I need to choose System 6? It's difficulty to have savings.

 

Thanks in advance.

I agree that the OA difference is extreme. I just let Trace run wild and do
the calculation so I'm sure I have some crazy factors that would be adjusted
for a "real" design.  In retrospect, I should have looked at it closer
BEFORE submitting to USGBC.  I'm sure it made them closer at it, whereas if
I was only slightly different they may have not questioned it.  Lesson
learned!

 

It doesn't look like I'll get anywhere with USGBC, though, as the reviewer
explicitly stated, "the total minimum outdoor air ventilation volume in the
Baseline model must never be greater than the Proposed model."

 

Thanks for all the input!

note that 90.1 requires the <i>minimum</i> outdoor ventilation rates be 
the same in both the proposed and baseline models.  this is to prevent 
gaming of the baseline system sizes by adding capacity/increasing unit 
sizes which will increase baseline energy cost.

though the baseline ventilation rate(s) can be the same or less than the 
proposed they can't be more.

when would the baseline be the same?  when you only provide the minimum 
required outside air per ashrae 62.

when would they be different?  when you provide more outside air in the 
proposed design than is required by ashrae 62.
e.g.1  providing 30% more outdoor air than required to obtain 1 leed 
point via ieqc2 (increased ventilation)   (or using the international 
mechanical code ventilation rates if your local jurisdiction does not 
accept ashrae 62)
e.g.2  using evap cooling systems sized on air change rate by volume & 
100% outdoor air.  ashrae 62 may require only 2,000 cfm but if you 
provide 20,000 cfm (based on space volume) then the proposed would have 
20,000 cfm outdoor air and the baseline would have 2,000 cfm.  in a case 
such as this using 20,000 cfm in the baseline would require a very 
oversized unit that would use a lot more energy to condition the outdoor 
air and would reward you with more points under eac1/eap2.

Unless I'm misunderstanding something, your sentence:

'when would the baseline be the same?  when you only provide the minimum required outside air per ashrae 62.'

Seems untrue to me.  Just so everyone is clear, under exact same conditions (occupancy, sqft, bldg type etc.), with the only difference being system type (VAV versus DOAS), the minimum required ventilation cfm required by ASHRAE 62.1 will be different.  The VAV system will almost always demand a higher minimum ventilation cfm, sometimes significantly more, since one zone can drive the system towards 100% outside air.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] DOAS and baseline OA

note that 90.1 requires the <i>minimum</i> outdoor ventilation rates be the same in both the proposed and baseline models.  this is to prevent gaming of the baseline system sizes by adding capacity/increasing unit sizes which will increase baseline energy cost.

though the baseline ventilation rate(s) can be the same or less than the proposed they can't be more.

when would the baseline be the same?  when you only provide the minimum required outside air per ashrae 62.

when would they be different?  when you provide more outside air in the proposed design than is required by ashrae 62.
e.g.1  providing 30% more outdoor air than required to obtain 1 leed point via ieqc2 (increased ventilation)   (or using the international mechanical code ventilation rates if your local jurisdiction does not accept ashrae 62)
e.g.2  using evap cooling systems sized on air change rate by volume & 100% outdoor air.  ashrae 62 may require only 2,000 cfm but if you provide 20,000 cfm (based on space volume) then the proposed would have 20,000 cfm outdoor air and the baseline would have 2,000 cfm.  in a case such as this using 20,000 cfm in the baseline would require a very oversized unit that would use a lot more energy to condition the outdoor air and would reward you with more points under eac1/eap2.

It doesn't look like I'll get anywhere with USGBC, though, as the reviewer explicitly stated, "the total minimum outdoor air ventilation volume in the Baseline model must never be greater than the Proposed model."

Thanks for all the input!

While I don't intend to discuss the merits of VAV systems and know I'm part of a minority in that area, this is exactly why DOAS systems are being explored more right now on the research side (take for example the number of ASHRAE Journal articles on the topic over the past few years).  Without seeing your OA calcs I would also agree that the difference is more than I would expect between the two systems, but I'm more inclined to think the DOAS might be a bit low if it is being used in conjunction with FCUs.  VAV systems are typically underventilated due to two common mistakes in the calculations: not analyzing with the correct Ez and not using the minimum expected primary airflow for design purposes (refer to ASHRAE 62.1-2007 Section 6.2.5.1, specifically the note in that section).  When fixing these two typical mistakes in calculations without optimizing the primary airflow rates, I typically see OA requirements double from the incorrectly calculated values.

This situation is a good example of when to do one of two things (possibly both together)

If this is a LEED project, submit a project-specific CIR

Use section ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Section 2.5 Exceptional Calculation Methodology to get around the requirement and document the energy savings from reduced OA requirements for a DOAS system.

Anne,

While LEED/ASHRAE 90.1 requires the ventilation rates to be the same in both the Baseline and Proposed systems, the calculated difference for the two systems is much higher than expected. Suggest taking another look at the calculations and confirming that the critical zone for the VAV system has been properly determined and whether appropriate factors for the zone air distribution effectiveness (Ez) and system ventilation efficiency (Ev) have been applied.

I'm curious how everyone is handling the OA for Appendix G simulations when using a DOAS in the proposed system.  We have a design that is DOAS + FCU with a  total OA of 8,000 CFM.  When you run the OA calcs for this same building with a VAV system (the baseline), the total OA required to meet Standard 62 is 39,000 CFM.

Hi All,

I am trying to Change the Air Distribution system from VAV reheat to
Constant Volume reheat. For this I am making changes in an existing file
with VAV reheat system.

I am getting a  Node Connection Error, "Node="BASEMENT REHEAT COIL HW
INLET", Inlet node did not find an appropriate matching "outlet" node.If
this is an outdoor air inlet node, it must be listed in an OutdoorAir:Node
or OutdoorAir:NodeList object."

 While i checked all the Inlet/Outlet Node names, branches and nodes. Guess
i am missing something, Could you suggest what else i need to check?

Thanks,
Shubha

in reality, i would agree with you.  if you were attempting to compare 
energy simulations for two different types of systems and were comparing 
the difference in outdoor air loads on system size/capacity (and costs 
of different systems) using the minimum per the different system types 
would be beneficial.

in leedality though the approach is a little different.  90.1 app g 
requires the minimum outdoor ventilation be the same to help prevent 
gaming the energy simulations, and is "enforced" by the leed reviewer's 
commenting on it.   the outdoor ventilation rate is the minimum designed 
outdoor ventilation rate.  so if the design is for a DOAS system then 
the minimum outdoor air rate for that system type is to be used in the 
baseline system.  same as if it the design were a packaged system but 
the baseline were VAV based on SF of the building (it happens) - the 
minimum oa rate would be what is designed for the packaged system.

except for the exception noted on page 182 when using dcv in the 
proposed if it is not required in the baseline.

look in the user's manual on page g-26, right column in the 1st 
ventilation paragraph, "outdoor air ventilation can be a major 
contributor to building energy consumption, but i is not considered an 
opportunity for energy savings under the performance rating method.  the 
minimum ventilation rates designed for the proposed building (not 
counting extra ventilation for economizer cooling) must also be modeled 
the same in both the baseline building and the proposed building."

in other words, in order to comply with the energy simulation 
requirements of 90.1 appendix g (the performance rating method) the 
minimum outdoor air rate has to be the same in both the proposed and 
baseline energy simulations (models).  so yes, outside of the one 
exception for dcv systems, the baseline outdoor air rate is the same as 
the proposed if you are only providing the minimum required per ashrae 
62 regardless of what system type the baseline building is required to use.

Look at this paper -?http://www.ibpsa.us/pub/simbuild2010/papers/SB10-DOC-TS03A-02-Gagne.pdf
Jamie Gagne gave a demonstration of the program developed at MIT to suggest?optimum?window size + shading + glazing combination. It was pretty cool. All you need to input is the sketch up block geometry and specify illumination and glare criteria. ?
I am not sure about the commercial availability of this though.?

Hope this helps

Thanks for your assistance Khalid! I hadn't used the Average Daylight Factor equation since undergrad years: totally forgot about it. I should have been more specific when I referred to 'window options', but I meant window size, distribution and location (i.e. orientation, head-height, etc.).

Paul, it is not clear for me what you mean by window options; if u mean window area, then u can use the Average Daylight Factor equation which is a very simple equation where you can decide on window area and glazing transmittance. The equation is based on the Overcast Sky as a design sky, however, If you can decide on the type of design sky ?(the external horizontal illuminance) then you can use such equation.
?
If you are looking for a program that can do daylighting analysis, then ther are a lot of programs such; Ecotect, SPOT, DAYSIM, SUPERLITE 2.0, ?etc ?
If want to study the effect of window area on energy consumption, then u need to use energy simulation programs, such as EnergyPlus and DOE-2

Paul
You might try COMFEN, an early design tool for facades and daylighting that
runs EnergyPlus and provides access to WINDOW, Radiance and a variety of
glazing and shading data bases. You can do multiple comparative simulations
simultaneously to compare heating/cooling/daylighting tradeoffs.  An updated
version will be out by end of August but you can download V3 at
http://windows.lbl.gov/software/comfen/comfen.html
There is a Users Manual and Video Tutorial along with the software download.

Message-ID: <CACX=hXtc4n+jfvo3toRxhdY1KLGsmU7_gj9MHP0WFa-4J4dJWg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,


We are working on quantifying uncertainty in diffuse irradiance calculated
by the Perez model.
We quantify uncertainty by comparing Perez model outcomes against measured
diffuse irradiance on tilted surfaces through a mathematical formulation
that can identify where the Perez model falls short for its predictability.

For this analysis, we need the two measured data from the same period on the
same location:
(1) measured diffuse irradiance on tilted surfaces
(2) measured diffuse irradiance on horizontal surfaces (used as input for
the Perez model)

We have hard time obtaining enough data for analysis.

Can anyone know where we can access reliable dataset including the two
measured data?



Thanks,
Yeonsook

Patrick,
I clearly understand that you can't change the outside air rate just because the system changes.  I'd like to explore the correct ventilation rate that should be used in both buildings.

ASHRAE 90.1-2007, section G3.1.2.5 states, Minimum outdoor air ventilation rates shall be the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs."

LEED 2009 reference guide, page 272 says, "Outdoor ventilation rates should be identical to proposed case."

When I've increased the ventilation rate by 30% for IEQc2, I have used the increased ventilation rate in both baseline and proposed.  I have not received any comments against that.  Has anyone else?  Even though the ASHRAE 62.1 calc may say the minimum ventilation required is 100 cfm, if I my drawings say "set the outside air damper minimum position to 130cfm," 130 cfm is then the minimum ventilation rate.

Is the quote from user's manual verbatim? "...the minimum ventilation rates designed for the proposed building must also be modeled the same..."  It uses the word designed.

Where does it say the 62.1 calculated rate has to be used?  Thanks for your feedback.

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] DOAS and baseline OA

in reality, i would agree with you.  if you were attempting to compare energy simulations for two different types of systems and were comparing the difference in outdoor air loads on system size/capacity (and costs of different systems) using the minimum per the different system types would be beneficial.

in leedality though the approach is a little different.  90.1 app g requires the minimum outdoor ventilation be the same to help prevent gaming the energy simulations, and is "enforced" by the leed reviewer's commenting on it.   the outdoor ventilation rate is the minimum designed outdoor ventilation rate.  so if the design is for a DOAS system then the minimum outdoor air rate for that system type is to be used in the baseline system.  same as if it the design were a packaged system but the baseline were VAV based on SF of the building (it happens) - the minimum oa rate would be what is designed for the packaged system.

except for the exception noted on page 182 when using dcv in the proposed if it is not required in the baseline.

look in the user's manual on page g-26, right column in the 1st ventilation paragraph, "outdoor air ventilation can be a major contributor to building energy consumption, but i is not considered an opportunity for energy savings under the performance rating method.  the minimum ventilation rates designed for the proposed building (not counting extra ventilation for economizer cooling) must also be modeled the same in both the baseline building and the proposed building."

in other words, in order to comply with the energy simulation requirements of 90.1 appendix g (the performance rating method) the minimum outdoor air rate has to be the same in both the proposed and baseline energy simulations (models).  so yes, outside of the one exception for dcv systems, the baseline outdoor air rate is the same as the proposed if you are only providing the minimum required per ashrae 62 regardless of what system type the baseline building is required to use.

On 8/18/11 7:47 AM, Michael A. Eustice wrote:
Unless I'm misunderstanding something, your sentence:

'when would the baseline be the same?  when you only provide the minimum required outside air per ashrae 62.'

Seems untrue to me.  Just so everyone is clear, under exact same conditions (occupancy, sqft, bldg type etc.), with the only difference being system type (VAV versus DOAS), the minimum required ventilation cfm required by ASHRAE 62.1 will be different.  The VAV system will almost always demand a higher minimum ventilation cfm, sometimes significantly more, since one zone can drive the system towards 100% outside air.

note that 90.1 requires the <i>minimum</i> outdoor ventilation rates be the same in both the proposed and baseline models.  this is to prevent gaming of the baseline system sizes by adding capacity/increasing unit sizes which will increase baseline energy cost.

though the baseline ventilation rate(s) can be the same or less than the proposed they can't be more.

when would the baseline be the same?  when you only provide the minimum required outside air per ashrae 62.

when would they be different?  when you provide more outside air in the proposed design than is required by ashrae 62.
e.g.1  providing 30% more outdoor air than required to obtain 1 leed point via ieqc2 (increased ventilation)   (or using the international mechanical code ventilation rates if your local jurisdiction does not accept ashrae 62)
e.g.2  using evap cooling systems sized on air change rate by volume & 100% outdoor air.  ashrae 62 may require only 2,000 cfm but if you provide 20,000 cfm (based on space volume) then the proposed would have 20,000 cfm outdoor air and the baseline would have 2,000 cfm.  in a case such as this using 20,000 cfm in the baseline would require a very oversized unit that would use a lot more energy to condition the outdoor air and would reward you with more points under eac1/eap2.

It doesn't look like I'll get anywhere with USGBC, though, as the reviewer explicitly stated, "the total minimum outdoor air ventilation volume in the Baseline model must never be greater than the Proposed model."

Thanks for all the input!

Subject: Re: [Bldg-sim] DOAS and baseline OA

While I don't intend to discuss the merits of VAV systems and know I'm part of a minority in that area, this is exactly why DOAS systems are being explored more right now on the research side (take for example the number of ASHRAE Journal articles on the topic over the past few years).  Without seeing your OA calcs I would also agree that the difference is more than I would expect between the two systems, but I'm more inclined to think the DOAS might be a bit low if it is being used in conjunction with FCUs.  VAV systems are typically underventilated due to two common mistakes in the calculations: not analyzing with the correct Ez and not using the minimum expected primary airflow for design purposes (refer to ASHRAE 62.1-2007 Section 6.2.5.1, specifically the note in that section).  When fixing these two typical mistakes in calculations without optimizing the primary airflow rates, I typically see OA requirements double from the incorrectly calculated values.

This situation is a good example of when to do one of two things (possibly both together)

If this is a LEED project, submit a project-specific CIR

Use section ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Section 2.5 Exceptional Calculation Methodology to get around the requirement and document the energy savings from reduced OA requirements for a DOAS system.

Anne,

While LEED/ASHRAE 90.1 requires the ventilation rates to be the same in both the Baseline and Proposed systems, the calculated difference for the two systems is much higher than expected. Suggest taking another look at the calculations and confirming that the critical zone for the VAV system has been properly determined and whether appropriate factors for the zone air distribution effectiveness (Ez) and system ventilation efficiency (Ev) have been applied.

Dear Anne,
I'm not sure why you think the OA requirement varies by system.  I'm not well versed in Standard 62, but my basic understanding is that one of the calculation methods is the result of building area and number of occupants.  Those are unchanged by system selection ... which is why it makes sense for Appendix G to require matching volumes.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] DOAS and baseline OA

I'm curious how everyone is handling the OA for Appendix G simulations when using a DOAS in the proposed system.  We have a design that is DOAS + FCU with a  total OA of 8,000 CFM.  When you run the OA calcs for this same building with a VAV system (the baseline), the total OA required to meet Standard 62 is 39,000 CFM.  This difference in OA represents a significant energy savings (in climate zone 4A), yet Appendix G requires the OA volumes to match.  It does not seem "fair" to me that the proposed case cannot take credit for design choice when it comes to OA.  I feel like Appendix G should make an exception for DOAS.  Am I missing something?  Is there a way around this?  Any thoughts are appreciated!

Anne

Yeonsook,

Since we use the Perez algorithm to split Global Horizontal into Direct and Diffuse in our global weather data platform as part of the input stream to support building and energy modeling, we would love to see your results when they are available.  
Part of the data we used to calibrate the Global and Direct came from the University of Oregon?s network of radiation sensors in the Northwest.  I do not know what they have in Diffuse but we found their multiple, co-located sensors to be very useful in our studies of Global and Direct radiation.

- Chuck

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Reliable dataset of diffuse irradiance measured on horizontal and vertical surfaces

Hi all,


We are working on quantifying uncertainty in diffuse irradiance calculated by the Perez model. 
We quantify uncertainty by comparing Perez model outcomes against measured diffuse irradiance on tilted surfaces through a mathematical formulation that can identify where the Perez model falls short for its predictability. 

For this analysis, we need the two measured data from the same period on the same location: 
(1) measured diffuse irradiance on tilted surfaces 
(2) measured diffuse irradiance on horizontal surfaces (used as input for the Perez model)

We have hard time obtaining enough data for analysis. 

Can anyone know where we can access reliable dataset including the two measured data?



Thanks,
Yeonsook

fancy meeting you here reba ;-)

1. the quote from the user's manual is verbatim, and 90.1 itself also 
refers to it as "proposed and baseline designs"
2. depending on your leed review team the potential difference between 
proposed and baseline may not be caught.  that really depends (like 
anything else) on the specific reviewer's knowledge of 90.1/user's 
manual.  i've done it the same way you have over the years and not 
received a comment on it for packaged system but did have a comment on 
it for a project with both packaged and evap cooler systems in a 
firestation or two ago.  i think how non-packaged/non-vav systems might 
be more of a key in how to interpret it.

3. neither the handbook, or standard, to my knowledge specifically calls 
out ashrae 62 calculations as the minimum in the actual text of the 
relevant section.  if you were modeling to the 2000/3/6/9 international 
mechanical code i would think it would apply the same way.  specifically 
for leed purposes though the baseline is ashrae 62 so i will comment 
around its requirements as it also impacts ieqc2.  but i can see how the 
"minimum designed" might be interpreted differently than the "minimum 
calculated" by ashrae 62.

thinking out loud for a minute, as engineers designing a system how do 
we approach the outside air calculations and how do we show compliance 
for plan review or leed purposes?  typically we first look at the 
project, what type of zoning we want, what systems we're planning on 
using, and then we calculate what the minimum outdoor air rate is 
required by whatever code we are using.  we typically use ashrae 62 so 
we can reduce the outdoor air compared to the international mechanical 
code, save some energy, and possibly downsize smaller packaged units 
(when applicable) and since it is the basis for leed compliance points 
it is easy to use the ashrae/leed provided spreadsheet -so we've killed 
2 birds with one stone.  calculated minimum outdoor air per 62, and have 
a speadsheet to show leed/plan review compliance for the minimum outdoor 
air rate.

so now we have a minimum calculated outdoor air rate, per ashrae 62.   
in packaged/vav systems does this number constitute the minimum outdoor 
air rate we are designing to? i think we would agree if 100 cfm were 
required, and we provided 100 cfm, then the minimum design rate is the 
same as the provided design rate.  but if 100 cfm were required and we 
were to provide 130 cfm because we are designing the system to obtain 
one leed point from ieqc2 are we designing to 130 cfm as a minimum?  or 
designing to 100 cfm as a minimum because that is the requirement we 
start with to get to 130 cfm as 30% more?

but the key for intent, i think, is more obviously when you're using 
non-mechanically cooled systems like evap coolers.  evap coolers are 
sized (typically) on volume to create an air change rate of 2.5 to 3 
minutes.  going back to my previous email, if you use ashrae 62 
calculations and find you are only required to provide 2,000 cfm of 
outdoor air but you are designing an evap system that "requires" 100% of 
outdoor air at 20,000 cfm based on the volume of the space and the air 
change rate, what is the minimum you are designing to?  you know you're 
designing to the 20,000 cfm to have a properly sized evap cooler.  but 
if you use 20,000 cfm as the outdoor air rate in your baseline 
simulation the equipment size in the simulation is now a 50-ton unit 
just in airflow capacity.  since 90.1 requires the baseline units to be 
sized per load this is now making the baseline load the outdoor air rate 
and not a reflection of the heat gain through the building envelope and 
from equipment/people.

so imho the intent is to size the baseline on the ashrae 62 calculations 
for the minimum required outdoor air rate.

i received a response from the usgbc support desk on this before & will 
look it up again to see what their exact language was - it concerned the 
use of evap coolers and outdoor air rates but it was what pointed me in 
the direction that the baseline outdoor air rate could be lower than the 
proposed based on what was required.

We have had reviews where 30% increase ventilation and DCV was provided the
GBCI indicated they being the persons with "Authority" would require 130 cfm
for the proposed system and 100 cfm for the baseline--minimum ventilation as
long as the baseline was the ASHRAE 62.1 minimum.  Even though you would
think they would both be 130 cfm.  Strange.

Patrick,

I clearly understand that you can't change the outside air rate just because
the system changes.  I'd like to explore the correct ventilation rate that
should be used in both buildings.

 

ASHRAE 90.1-2007, section G3.1.2.5 states, Minimum outdoor air ventilation
rates shall be the same for both the proposed and baseline building designs."


 

LEED 2009 reference guide, page 272 says, "Outdoor ventilation rates should
be identical to proposed case."

 

When I've increased the ventilation rate by 30% for IEQc2, I have used the
increased ventilation rate in both baseline and proposed.  I have not
received any comments against that.  Has anyone else?  Even though the ASHRAE
62.1 calc may say the minimum ventilation required is 100 cfm, if I my
drawings say "set the outside air damper minimum position to 130cfm," 130 cfm
is then the minimum ventilation rate.

 

Is the quote from user's manual verbatim? "...the minimum ventilation rates
designed for the proposed building must also be modeled the same..."  It uses
the word designed.

 

Where does it say the 62.1 calculated rate has to be used?  Thanks for your
feedback.

 

Reba

in reality, i would agree with you.  if you were attempting to compare energy
simulations for two different types of systems and were comparing the
difference in outdoor air loads on system size/capacity (and costs of
different systems) using the minimum per the different system types would be
beneficial.

in leedality though the approach is a little different.  90.1 app g requires
the minimum outdoor ventilation be the same to help prevent gaming the energy
simulations, and is "enforced" by the leed reviewer's commenting on it.   the
outdoor ventilation rate is the minimum designed outdoor ventilation rate.
so if the design is for a DOAS system then the minimum outdoor air rate for
that system type is to be used in the baseline system.  same as if it the
design were a packaged system but the baseline were VAV based on SF of the
building (it happens) - the minimum oa rate would be what is designed for the
packaged system.

except for the exception noted on page 182 when using dcv in the proposed if
it is not required in the baseline.

look in the user's manual on page g-26, right column in the 1st ventilation
paragraph, "outdoor air ventilation can be a major contributor to building
energy consumption, but i is not considered an opportunity for energy savings
under the performance rating method.  the minimum ventilation rates designed
for the proposed building (not counting extra ventilation for economizer
cooling) must also be modeled the same in both the baseline building and the
proposed building."

in other words, in order to comply with the energy simulation requirements of
90.1 appendix g (the performance rating method) the minimum outdoor air rate
has to be the same in both the proposed and baseline energy simulations
(models).  so yes, outside of the one exception for dcv systems, the baseline
outdoor air rate is the same as the proposed if you are only providing the
minimum required per ashrae 62 regardless of what system type the baseline
building is required to use.

Unless I'm misunderstanding something, your sentence: 

 

'when would the baseline be the same?  when you only provide the minimum
required outside air per ashrae 62.'  

 

Seems untrue to me.  Just so everyone is clear, under exact same conditions
(occupancy, sqft, bldg type etc.), with the only difference being system type
(VAV versus DOAS), the minimum required ventilation cfm required by ASHRAE
62.1 will be different.  The VAV system will almost always demand a higher
minimum ventilation cfm, sometimes significantly more, since one zone can
drive the system towards 100% outside air.

note that 90.1 requires the <i>minimum</i> outdoor ventilation rates be the
same in both the proposed and baseline models.  this is to prevent gaming of
the baseline system sizes by adding capacity/increasing unit sizes which will
increase baseline energy cost. 

though the baseline ventilation rate(s) can be the same or less than the
proposed they can't be more.  

when would the baseline be the same?  when you only provide the minimum
required outside air per ashrae 62.  

when would they be different?  when you provide more outside air in the
proposed design than is required by ashrae 62.  
e.g.1  providing 30% more outdoor air than required to obtain 1 leed point
via ieqc2 (increased ventilation)   (or using the international mechanical
code ventilation rates if your local jurisdiction does not accept ashrae 62)
e.g.2  using evap cooling systems sized on air change rate by volume & 100%
outdoor air.  ashrae 62 may require only 2,000 cfm but if you provide 20,000
cfm (based on space volume) then the proposed would have 20,000 cfm outdoor
air and the baseline would have 2,000 cfm.  in a case such as this using
20,000 cfm in the baseline would require a very oversized unit that would use
a lot more energy to condition the outdoor air and would reward you with more
points under eac1/eap2.

I agree that the OA difference is extreme... I just let Trace run wild and do

submitting to USGBC.  I'm sure it made them closer at it, whereas if I was
only slightly different they may have not questioned it.  Lesson learned!

 

It doesn't look like I'll get anywhere with USGBC, though, as the reviewer
explicitly stated, "the total minimum outdoor air ventilation volume in the
Baseline model must never be greater than the Proposed model."

 

Thanks for all the input!

While I don't intend to discuss the merits of VAV systems and know I'm part
of a minority in that area, this is exactly why DOAS systems are being
explored more right now on the research side (take for example the number of
ASHRAE Journal articles on the topic over the past few years).  Without
seeing your OA calcs I would also agree that the difference is more than I
would expect between the two systems, but I'm more inclined to think the DOAS
might be a bit low if it is being used in conjunction with FCUs.  VAV systems
are typically underventilated due to two common mistakes in the calculations:
not analyzing with the correct Ez and not using the minimum expected primary
airflow for design purposes (refer to ASHRAE 62.1-2007 Section 6.2.5.1,
specifically the note in that section).  When fixing these two typical
mistakes in calculations without optimizing the primary airflow rates, I
typically see OA requirements double from the incorrectly calculated values.

 

This situation is a good example of when to do one of two things (possibly
both together)

If this is a LEED project, submit a project-specific CIR

Use section ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Section 2.5 Exceptional Calculation Methodology
to get around the requirement and document the energy savings from reduced OA
requirements for a DOAS system.

Anne,

While LEED/ASHRAE 90.1 requires the ventilation rates to be the same in both
the Baseline and Proposed systems, the calculated difference for the two
systems is much higher than expected. Suggest taking another look at the
calculations and confirming that the critical zone for the VAV system has
been properly determined and whether appropriate factors for the zone air
distribution effectiveness (Ez) and system ventilation efficiency (Ev) have
been applied.

I'm curious how everyone is handling the OA for Appendix G simulations when
using a DOAS in the proposed system.  We have a design that is DOAS + FCU
with a  total OA of 8,000 CFM.  When you run the OA calcs for this same
building with a VAV system (the baseline), the total OA required to meet
Standard 62 is 39,000 CFM.  This difference in OA represents a significant
energy savings (in climate zone 4A), yet Appendix G requires the OA volumes
to match.  It does not seem "fair" to me that the proposed case cannot take
credit for design choice when it comes to OA.  I feel like Appendix G should
make an exception for DOAS.  Am I missing something?  Is there a way around
this?  Any thoughts are appreciated!

Dear Colleagues,

I am looking for a software for external shading device design.
I can recall a software that I used long time ago, which has a visual interface to show a size of overhang / fin based on input. Unfortunately, I cannot remember the name.

Please recommend any software which has similar functions.

Thanks in advance,

If the general goal of LEED is to save energy, that is the correct
approach for the reviewers to pursue.  I always submit my models using
that logic, because our models should reflect the energy penalty
associated with over-ventilating buildings.

Patrick,

I clearly understand that you can't change the outside air rate just
because
the system changes.  I'd like to explore the correct ventilation rate that
should be used in both buildings.



ASHRAE 90.1-2007, section G3.1.2.5 states, Minimum outdoor air ventilation
rates shall be the same for both the proposed and baseline building
designs."




LEED 2009 reference guide, page 272 says, "Outdoor ventilation rates
should
be identical to proposed case."



When I've increased the ventilation rate by 30% for IEQc2, I have used the
increased ventilation rate in both baseline and proposed.  I have not
received any comments against that.  Has anyone else?  Even though the
ASHRAE
62.1 calc may say the minimum ventilation required is 100 cfm, if I my
drawings say "set the outside air damper minimum position to 130cfm," 130
cfm
is then the minimum ventilation rate.



Is the quote from user's manual verbatim? "...the minimum ventilation
rates
designed for the proposed building must also be modeled the same..."  It
uses
the word designed.



Where does it say the 62.1 calculated rate has to be used?  Thanks for
your
feedback.

in reality, i would agree with you.  if you were attempting to compare
energy
simulations for two different types of systems and were comparing the
difference in outdoor air loads on system size/capacity (and costs of
different systems) using the minimum per the different system types would
be
beneficial.

in leedality though the approach is a little different.  90.1 app g
requires
the minimum outdoor ventilation be the same to help prevent gaming the
energy
simulations, and is "enforced" by the leed reviewer's commenting on it.
the
outdoor ventilation rate is the minimum designed outdoor ventilation rate.
so if the design is for a DOAS system then the minimum outdoor air rate
for
that system type is to be used in the baseline system.  same as if it the
design were a packaged system but the baseline were VAV based on SF of the
building (it happens) - the minimum oa rate would be what is designed for
the
packaged system.

except for the exception noted on page 182 when using dcv in the proposed
if
it is not required in the baseline.

look in the user's manual on page g-26, right column in the 1st
ventilation
paragraph, "outdoor air ventilation can be a major contributor to building
energy consumption, but i is not considered an opportunity for energy
savings
under the performance rating method.  the minimum ventilation rates
designed
for the proposed building (not counting extra ventilation for economizer
cooling) must also be modeled the same in both the baseline building and
the
proposed building."

in other words, in order to comply with the energy simulation requirements
of
90.1 appendix g (the performance rating method) the minimum outdoor air
rate
has to be the same in both the proposed and baseline energy simulations
(models).  so yes, outside of the one exception for dcv systems, the
baseline
outdoor air rate is the same as the proposed if you are only providing the
minimum required per ashrae 62 regardless of what system type the baseline
building is required to use.

Unless I'm misunderstanding something, your sentence:

Seems untrue to me.  Just so everyone is clear, under exact same
conditions
(occupancy, sqft, bldg type etc.), with the only difference being system
type
(VAV versus DOAS), the minimum required ventilation cfm required by ASHRAE
62.1 will be different.  The VAV system will almost always demand a higher
minimum ventilation cfm, sometimes significantly more, since one zone can
drive the system towards 100% outside air.

note that 90.1 requires the <i>minimum</i> outdoor ventilation rates be
the
same in both the proposed and baseline models.  this is to prevent gaming
of
the baseline system sizes by adding capacity/increasing unit sizes which
will
increase baseline energy cost.

though the baseline ventilation rate(s) can be the same or less than the
proposed they can't be more.

when would the baseline be the same?  when you only provide the minimum
required outside air per ashrae 62.

when would they be different?  when you provide more outside air in the
proposed design than is required by ashrae 62.
e.g.1  providing 30% more outdoor air than required to obtain 1 leed point
via ieqc2 (increased ventilation)   (or using the international mechanical
code ventilation rates if your local jurisdiction does not accept ashrae
62)
e.g.2  using evap cooling systems sized on air change rate by volume &
100%
outdoor air.  ashrae 62 may require only 2,000 cfm but if you provide
20,000
cfm (based on space volume) then the proposed would have 20,000 cfm
outdoor
air and the baseline would have 2,000 cfm.  in a case such as this using
20,000 cfm in the baseline would require a very oversized unit that would
use
a lot more energy to condition the outdoor air and would reward you with
more
points under eac1/eap2.

It doesn't look like I'll get anywhere with USGBC, though, as the reviewer

While I don't intend to discuss the merits of VAV systems and know I'm
part
of a minority in that area, this is exactly why DOAS systems are being
explored more right now on the research side (take for example the number
of
ASHRAE Journal articles on the topic over the past few years).  Without
seeing your OA calcs I would also agree that the difference is more than I
would expect between the two systems, but I'm more inclined to think the
DOAS
might be a bit low if it is being used in conjunction with FCUs.  VAV
systems
are typically underventilated due to two common mistakes in the
calculations:
not analyzing with the correct Ez and not using the minimum expected
primary
airflow for design purposes (refer to ASHRAE 62.1-2007 Section 6.2.5.1,
specifically the note in that section).  When fixing these two typical
mistakes in calculations without optimizing the primary airflow rates, I
typically see OA requirements double from the incorrectly calculated
values.



This situation is a good example of when to do one of two things (possibly
both together)

If this is a LEED project, submit a project-specific CIR

Use section ASHRAE 90.1-2007 Section 2.5 Exceptional Calculation
Methodology
to get around the requirement and document the energy savings from reduced
OA
requirements for a DOAS system.

Anne,

While LEED/ASHRAE 90.1 requires the ventilation rates to be the same in
both
the Baseline and Proposed systems, the calculated difference for the two
systems is much higher than expected. Suggest taking another look at the
calculations and confirming that the critical zone for the VAV system has
been properly determined and whether appropriate factors for the zone air
distribution effectiveness (Ez) and system ventilation efficiency (Ev)
have
been applied.

I'm not sure why you think the OA requirement varies by system.  I'm not
well

Those are unchanged by system selection ... which is why it makes sense
for
Appendix G to require matching volumes.

I'm curious how everyone is handling the OA for Appendix G simulations
when
using a DOAS in the proposed system.  We have a design that is DOAS + FCU
with a  total OA of 8,000 CFM.  When you run the OA calcs for this same
building with a VAV system (the baseline), the total OA required to meet
Standard 62 is 39,000 CFM.  This difference in OA represents a significant
energy savings (in climate zone 4A), yet Appendix G requires the OA
volumes
to match.  It does not seem "fair" to me that the proposed case cannot
take
credit for design choice when it comes to OA.  I feel like Appendix G
should
make an exception for DOAS.  Am I missing something?  Is there a way
around
this?  Any thoughts are appreciated!

Hello Bldg Sim Folks,

Could anyone comment on how they "translate" the F-factor requirement for on grade slabs into a U-value / material for a floor construction in Energy+ or eQuest

My method has always been to create a fictional material with negligible thickness that approximates the equivalent R-value for the whole floor area of the zone based on the edge requirement.  This results in me creating a separate one of these fictional materials for each zone.  This is because even though a zone might have the same F-factor requirement the difference in perimeter to floor area ratio effects the actual heat flux through the floor, or so I think.

Here is an example of how I have modeled this, see attached picture for a layout:
[cid:image001.png at 01CC6249.A570F5C0]

F-Factor = 0.64 (equivalent to R-10 insulation for 48" and for an "Unheated Slab" per ASHRAE 90.1 Table A6.3)

Zone 1
Area =                                   25 sqft
Edge Perimeter =             10 ft

Zone 2
Area =                                   375 sqft
Edge Perimeter =             70 ft

Perimeter * F factor = Area * U value equivalent

Zone 1 equivalent U = 0.256
Zone 2 equivalent U = 0.119

This process has made sense to me, but in reviewing this technique with a colleague we wondered what does everyone else do.  Am I under/over predicting slab loss for certain zones with this method?  Your comments and insight are always appreciated.

Thanks,
Josh

This process has made sense to me, but in reviewing this technique with a colleague we wondered what does everyone else do.  Am I under/over predicting slab loss for certain zones with this method?  Your comments and insight are always appreciated.

Thanks,

Hi John!

 

I think the short answer is bump up your ACH for the room "higher than
normal."  Trying to quantify any more specifically is probably a
fruitless endeavor - way too many variables in play...

 

Fundamentals 2009 has a fuzzy thing or two to say about to what extent
door infiltration ordinarily affects whole-building infiltration
(6-22%):

 

Windows and doors (6 to 22%; 15%). More variation in window

leakage is seen among window types (e.g., casement versus

double-hung) than among new windows of the same type from different

manufacturers (Weidt et al. 1979). Windows that seal by

compressing the weather strip (casements, awnings) show significantly

lower leakage than windows with sliding seals.

 

That may help you establish a ceiling to what's likely.

 

There's also a longer discussion relating that "rough" ACH estimations
have to be made in design for the purposes of sizing HVAC equipment on
(page 16.29)... Examples provided for some smallish (80-150SF)
vestibules range from 0.5 to 2.0 ACH, but importantly illustrate the
process is necessarily somewhat arbitrary.  The point they're making is
there are a bunch of hard to measure/estimate variables in play to
determine actual ACH, from height to hourly temperature differentials to
wind pressures.  

 

Throw a "higher" number at it, at least until someone can source/share
some table of "better guesses" =).

Joshua -

Confining my comments to eQUEST:

There appears to be a quick shortcut we've tried on some models:

eQUEST appears to create virtual materials with virtual R-vals to turn the UA product into the appropriate F-Perim product anticipated by ASHRAE.
This step occurs when exiting the Wizard mode - ie pushing the "Finish" button.
Floor slabs specified as slabs-on-grade will often have a virtual material in their layer definition - this virtual material's resistance will vary, and I believe it may be varying based on the ratio of perimeter to surface area.

If you've done all your zoning within the wizard, then it is possible to get eQUEST to automatically generate the different "virtual material" resistance factors for each of the different room's slab surfaces, if you need to vary slab insulation, and if the slab insulation options available in the Wizard include the option you're looking for.

Assuming you've left wizard mode, you can save the project as a separate file name (so as not to over-write any detailed edit changes), re-enter Wizard mode, reselect the slab insulation you would like, and "Finish" the wizard. The virtual material resistances will have changed. Then these virtual resistances can be copied to the virtual materials you have in the "real" detailed data edit file.

A caution - I haven't validated that this produces the exact correct factors to translate eQUEST's modeled area into the

Has anyone else on the list looked into this procedure?

Subject: [Bldg-sim] F-Factor

Hello Bldg Sim Folks,

Could anyone comment on how they "translate" the F-factor requirement for on grade slabs into a U-value / material for a floor construction in Energy+ or eQuest

My method has always been to create a fictional material with negligible thickness that approximates the equivalent R-value for the whole floor area of the zone based on the edge requirement.  This results in me creating a separate one of these fictional materials for each zone.  This is because even though a zone might have the same F-factor requirement the difference in perimeter to floor area ratio effects the actual heat flux through the floor, or so I think.

Here is an example of how I have modeled this, see attached picture for a layout:
[cid:image001.png at 01CC62BF.562F7C90]

F-Factor = 0.64 (equivalent to R-10 insulation for 48" and for an "Unheated Slab" per ASHRAE 90.1 Table A6.3)

Zone 1
Area =                                   25 sqft
Edge Perimeter =             10 ft

Zone 2
Area =                                   375 sqft
Edge Perimeter =             70 ft

Perimeter * F factor = Area * U value equivalent

Zone 1 equivalent U = 0.256
Zone 2 equivalent U = 0.119

This process has made sense to me, but in reviewing this technique with a colleague we wondered what does everyone else do.  Am I under/over predicting slab loss for certain zones with this method?  Your comments and insight are always appreciated.

Thanks,
Josh

Hello all,

 

I usual building LEED energy models in eQuest so I am used to analyzing the output reports from that program.

 

I've had to take over an energy model that we received mid-way through completion and need to complete for LEED submission.

 

Does anyone have suggested reports I should look at that are comparable to eQuest? I know a lot of the info is the same but in different locations/reports...

 

Thanks!

Turning?a file you used for load calculation?and equipment sizing into an energy model is not a quick thing.? Having the loads done is not half way.? You now need to make schedules for lighting, equipment & people, get the 8760 weather file, find out energy cost in the area, input equipment information and a few more quick things as indicated in ASHRAE 90.1.
?
I explain it to people by saying 'Doing?load calcs for?equipment sizing?is like taking 2 pictures, one in the summer and one in the winter.? Making an energy model is like making a full length movie with special effects.' 
?
And don't forget that you need to make 2 full length movies, one which will be build and then spend time on an another pretend building (baseline) to compare it to.
?
Good luck man.? We are here for you.

I don't know if this answers your question, but I have tried to determine the % of energy use due to the envelope?on a recent building by running multiple energy models.? What I found was the energy balance in complex.
?
An example is a perfect balance on a cold day 
"People" + "Lighting" + "Plug Loads" - "Loss through Wall" = 0
?
So if the insulation was higher, your loss though the wall would be less and the A/C power usage would be increased.
?
You could hand calculate the envelope energy demand for an empty unoccupied building, but with internal loads it gets foggy.
?
The energy model will show you what you can expect from various R-values, but I have not found a way to say x% of energy is due to the envelope.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Building envelope average energy demands

Hi All,

Can anyone advise a good resource (article, webpage, book, etc..) which states what is the average energy demands (construction+running costs) due to Envelopes only in buildings? I would need just a figure in percentage over the whole energy demands of a typical office building. Is this data somehow available?

Best,

Awesome analogies John!

 

I was writing up a response simultaneously and took it into a few other directions specific to LEED... for anyone curious, I'm in full support of John's response as well =).  To add to the hat: our office predominantly sizes up equipment using HAP (with a smattering of Trace), and I'm familiar with tying the load reports for both into energy models under eQuest as a QC measure.  

 

Will:

 

As a general QC practice, after everything is functionally set up and before "fine-tuning" steps like evaluating unmet hours, I will spot check and adjust as necessary to ensure an energy model is in the same ballpark as the designed loads, time permitting.  Zones of notably high occupancy/ventilation/equipment loads get higher priority.  In any model where you're specifying equipment capacities (not autosizing), askew loads are a common suspect for unmet hours.  Oftentimes, an energy model is wrapping up well after design loads are put together, and elements of design may have changed, so the energy model can in some fashion serve as a back-check for the load calcs as well.

 

I chose the word "ballpark" carefully:  Trying to match loads precisely/exactly between different software packages, outside of an academic exercise, wouldn't functionally accomplish much - acknowledging that even the most sophisticated load calculations are built on assumptions, estimations and weather predictions.  I've encountered some model reviewers (outside of LEED, btw) who conceptually miss the fundamental differences of purpose between a load calc and an energy model... but don't let such eye-rollers lead you astray =)!

 

That's not to say one cannot use an energy model to do load calcs (some certainly do), but before going down that path I think it's important to identify the calculations serve two tightly related but necessarily distinct purposes: sizing equipment (balancing "worst case" conditions against expected comfort and applying safety factors for present/future unknowns) and evaluating energy behavior, which means running with a longer set of assumptions (over time), permitting informed decisions for design to save $$$ on energy bills (or rainforests, if that's your metric of choice).  

 

"But Nick, I thought energy modeling was simply for LEED points..."  Well, that's what I thought getting started too, but I've grown to learn energy modeling produces much greater value than a plaque on the wall (hey, where's mine anyway?): it informs better design (which I appreciate as an MEP consultant), while simultaneously saving really big money for our clientele (and the rest of us indirectly paying every month for ever-increasing energy infrastructure).  Any indefinite environmental benefits, however fuzzy, are only icing on the cake.

 

Getting back to the original query:  The energy modeling process for LEED, and specifically for 90.1 Appendix G by design avoids the necessity to sync loads precisely with a load calc - the emphasis is instead on having the elements match the proposed design.  That said, you are expected to have equipment with capacities (heating/cooling/CFM/GPM) equivalent to what's scheduled, so by extension you do want to be in the same ballpark as the designed loads to avoid excessive undercooled/heated hours...

Will

 

Turning a file you used for load calculation and equipment sizing into an energy model is not a quick thing.  Having the loads done is not half way.  You now need to make schedules for lighting, equipment & people, get the 8760 weather file, find out energy cost in the area, input equipment information and a few more quick things as indicated in ASHRAE 90.1.

 

I explain it to people by saying 'Doing load calcs for equipment sizing is like taking 2 pictures, one in the summer and one in the winter.  Making an energy model is like making a full length movie with special effects.' 

 

And don't forget that you need to make 2 full length movies, one which will be build and then spend time on an another pretend building (baseline) to compare it to.

 

Good luck man.  We are here for you.

 

To answer the question, Yes, I use my Trace file I created for equipment sizing as the starting point for the energy model.

Maybe not quite what you are looking for, but we have a video  tutorial showing an envelope elimination parametric. In this example we used a full service restaurant but you can do this with any model. The approach is to run a baseline simulation and then to switch all exterior and ground exposed surfaces to an adiabatic boundary condition. Next remove all fenestration surfaces. Then re-run the model. Due to the load driven nature of this project the maximum savings through envelope improvements was just over 3%, but maybe would be 15-20% for an office. Of course it depends where the project is located; the harsher the climate, the more potential savings through envelope improvements. And it depends on the quality of the envelope that you use as a starting point; building activity, and mechanical system efficiency.

Here is a link to the video.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U91jeksOAw&list=PLF80F250937E2A648&index=38&feature=plpp

And here is a link to COP adjusted end use graphs in Google Documents
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhCALIzwiaGPdEI5ZHhaVmpfUHAtdGFDMjg5eW5tT1E&hl=en_US#gid=49

This doesn't mean that only 3% of the energy is due to the envelope, but it does show potential savings for retrofits on various elements. You could get more specific and just isolate the roof, or even solar gain from the windows. Or run create an elimination run for plug loads where you set loads to nothing.

David,
?
I did the same thing with one of my buildings.? I made "perfect insulation" which in Trace is simple deleting all the walls.? The result was an increase of energy use.? Since the internal loads were so high, too much insulation wouldn't allow the heat out.? (I compare it to a wrestler running around in plastic trying to cut weight.? It?may be winter, but you get real hot real quick.)
?
So in the case of the super insulation increasing the energy use,?what % of the total energy usage can I contribute to the skin load?? Would it be a negative percentage?
?

As an engineer reading that article I chuckled thinking "Do they realize 'energy loss' isn't always a bad thing?"
?
In your house, most of the time it is a bad thing.? In an office building it can be a good thing.? I think the answer you are looking for will be difficult to find.? If you make a good energy model you can site yourself.? And you get something like David talked about

And it depends on the quality of the envelope that you use as a starting point; building activity, and mechanical system efficiency.

In a way it is really the demand the thermostat setpoints put on heating  and cooling that along with lighting and equipment loads are responsible for all of the energy. Of course the role that the envelope and lighting/plug loads, people and ventilation play in altering a zones temperate. Take some responsibility, but as you suggest, you can?t just assign the energy to one building component or another. I tired that as well, and it isn?t as easy as splitting up end uses.

David,

I did the same thing with one of my buildings.  I made "perfect insulation" which in Trace is simple deleting all the walls.  The result was an increase of energy use.  Since the internal loads were so high, too much insulation wouldn't allow the heat out.  (I compare it to a wrestler running around in plastic trying to cut weight.  It may be winter, but you get real hot real quick.)

So in the case of the super insulation increasing the energy use, what % of the total energy usage can I contribute to the skin load?  Would it be a negative percentage?

Maybe not quite what you are looking for, but we have a video  tutorial showing an envelope elimination parametric. In this example we used a full service restaurant but you can do this with any model. The approach is to run a baseline simulation and then to switch all exterior and ground exposed surfaces to an adiabatic boundary condition. Next remove all fenestration surfaces. Then re-run the model. Due to the load driven nature of this project the maximum savings through envelope improvements was just over 3%, but maybe would be 15-20% for an office. Of course it depends where the project is located; the harsher the climate, the more potential savings through envelope improvements.

I don't know if this answers your question, but I have tried to determine the % of energy use due to the envelope on a recent building by running multiple energy models.  What I found was the energy balance in complex.

An example is a perfect balance on a cold day
"People" + "Lighting" + "Plug Loads" - "Loss through Wall" = 0

So if the insulation was higher, your loss though the wall would be less and the A/C power usage would be increased.

You could hand calculate the envelope energy demand for an empty unoccupied building, but with internal loads it gets foggy.

The energy model will show you what you can expect from various R-values, but I have not found a way to say x% of energy is due to the envelope.

Thanks for all the great responses!

 

I guess the main point I was trying to confirm was whether I would save time building the energy model from load calcs. Unfortunately, the way things are set up here, the LEED energy model is completed after 90% Construction Documents and not much preliminary modeling is done during the SD/DD stages.

 

All of you bring up good points that modeling is much more powerful and can be utilized as a tool to help drive design decisions early on. With the way the economy is, I can see more owners/developers asking why specific decisions are being made and energy modeling can provide some analytical data behind those decisions (rather than just saying, well this was done in the past or hey this looks nice).

 

Unfortunately, for this project, I just need to complete the LEED energy model the most efficient way which led me to throw out the loads to modeling question in the first place...

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] Loads to Energy Model

 

In my experience the problem with doing the load calculations first and then creating your energy model is that the model is often done too late to have much effect.

 

Too often the load calculations are not done until the building design is set, maybe end of SD but usually sometime in DD.  Most engineers don't seem to want to do the load calculations more than once.  By this time the vast majority of design decisions that affect energy use are cast in CAD and it is too late to change them.  The only thing you can affect are the details associated with the HVAC design.  Modeling done at the end for LEED points is frankly almost a waste of time.

I was writing up a response simultaneously and took it into a few other directions specific to LEED... for anyone curious, I'm in full support of John's response as well =).  To add to the hat: our office predominantly sizes up equipment using HAP (with a smattering of Trace), and I'm familiar with tying the load reports for both into energy models under eQuest as a QC measure.

As a general QC practice, after everything is functionally set up and before "fine-tuning" steps like evaluating unmet hours, I will spot check and adjust as necessary to ensure an energy model is in the same ballpark as the designed loads, time permitting.

That's not to say one cannot use an energy model to do load calcs (some certainly do), but before going down that path I think it's important to identify the calculations serve two tightly related but necessarily distinct purposes: sizing equipment (balancing "worst case" conditions against expected comfort and applying safety factors for present/future unknowns) and evaluating energy behavior, which means running with a longer set of assumptions (over time), permitting informed decisions for design to save $$$ on energy bills (or rainforests, if that's your metric of choice).

Giulio,

 

I am pretty sure you will ultimately find yourself frustrated if you try
to find "typical" costs (construction or consumption) for specific
building elements - as you may have gathered, the reality of energy cost
breakdowns varies widely even within a specific building type - so
averaged percentages between projects, even if found, may not be of much
practical use.  

 

We can only speculate as to for whom you're asking and why, but I expect
you will find it much easier to cite/source construction and/or derive
consumption costs of a specific envelope for a specific building, which
you can then compare/contrast to the project you're actually discussing
to extrapolate expectations.  

 

Ideally, a perfectly similar building would make for an easy comparison,
but simply make a point to identify the major differences in the
referenced building's makeup/location/equipment/occupant usage so that
you can factor the data to "fit" the project under discussion, as
necessary.

Maybe not quite what you are looking for, but we have a video  tutorial
showing an envelope elimination parametric. In this example we used a
full service restaurant but you can do this with any model. The approach
is to run a baseline simulation and then to switch all exterior and
ground exposed surfaces to an adiabatic boundary condition. Next remove
all fenestration surfaces. Then re-run the model. Due to the load driven
nature of this project the maximum savings through envelope improvements
was just over 3%, but maybe would be 15-20% for an office. Of course it
depends where the project is located; the harsher the climate, the more
potential savings through envelope improvements. And it depends on the
quality of the envelope that you use as a starting point; building
activity, and mechanical system efficiency. 

 

Here is a link to the video.

This doesn't mean that only 3% of the energy is due to the envelope, but
it does show potential savings for retrofits on various elements. You
could get more specific and just isolate the roof, or even solar gain
from the windows. Or run create an elimination run for plug loads where
you set loads to nothing.

I don't know if this answers your question, but I have tried to
determine the % of energy use due to the envelope on a recent building
by running multiple energy models.  What I found was the energy balance
in complex.

 

An example is a perfect balance on a cold day 

"People" + "Lighting" + "Plug Loads" - "Loss through Wall" = 0

 

So if the insulation was higher, your loss though the wall would be less
and the A/C power usage would be increased.

 

You could hand calculate the envelope energy demand for an empty
unoccupied building, but with internal loads it gets foggy.

 

The energy model will show you what you can expect from various
R-values, but I have not found a way to say x% of energy is due to the
envelope.

I've had some personal experiences and plenty of time to develop some opinions regarding the concerns Marcus raised.  This may help others trying to get a handle of some realities that can make energy modeling tricky for non-technical reasons:

 

1.        LEED is set up in its present state as a form of purely prescriptive, compliance modeling.  Fundamentally, this sort of modeling does not inform design well or at all - but rather targets a different role: benchmarking.  That's important to recognize, as LEED models have proven to be easily misconstrued in purpose.

2.       Many of us in time have come to realize that "informed design" grows from a non-prescriptive sort of modeling which isn't defined by LEED, 90.1 or any other "compliance" standards set by states and local govt's.  In my experience, such SD/DD stage models are often not "the LEED model" at an early stage, but rather something much more abstract and element-specific - tools custom-crafted on the fly to explore and answer project-specific queries.  Not all building owners and design teams recognize the value such modeling services bring to the table, but it's an understandably hard sell from the designers' perspective without positive direct experience to relate with.

3.       Some select 'enlightened' mechanical, envelope and electrical designers who I have the pleasure of working with make a point to allow energy modeling to inform their respective design work from the earliest to latest stages.  This sort of behavior is not spontaneous or natural... but it is encouraged by taking a few minutes during and after a big project to show individuals the impact they personally make with specific decisions (preferably the good ones!).  I recall one colleague's eyes bugging out when he learned a subtle choice of CFL lamping for a large project's can fixtures had an positive impact on the building's energy consumption measureable in full LEED points.  

4.       I find designers of all backgrounds and trades can be fairly easy to "sway" in this regard, but only if they have the inclination to learn and improve themselves - that's more of a personality issue no energy model can tackle.  Better to recognize when that's in play and focus your efforts towards individuals on the design team who will gain more from the knowledge you can share (perhaps outside of your office).

5.       We can't always get the best combination of clients or colleagues to work with for a given project - you sometimes just have to play the hand that's dealt for the next great opportunity to roll around - chin up =)!

Thanks for all the great responses!

 

I guess the main point I was trying to confirm was whether I would save time building the energy model from load calcs. Unfortunately, the way things are set up here, the LEED energy model is completed after 90% Construction Documents and not much preliminary modeling is done during the SD/DD stages.

 

All of you bring up good points that modeling is much more powerful and can be utilized as a tool to help drive design decisions early on. With the way the economy is, I can see more owners/developers asking why specific decisions are being made and energy modeling can provide some analytical data behind those decisions (rather than just saying, well this was done in the past or hey this looks nice).

 

Unfortunately, for this project, I just need to complete the LEED energy model the most efficient way which led me to throw out the loads to modeling question in the first place...

In my experience the problem with doing the load calculations first and then creating your energy model is that the model is often done too late to have much effect.

 

Too often the load calculations are not done until the building design is set, maybe end of SD but usually sometime in DD.  Most engineers don't seem to want to do the load calculations more than once.  By this time the vast majority of design decisions that affect energy use are cast in CAD and it is too late to change them.  The only thing you can affect are the details associated with the HVAC design.  Modeling done at the end for LEED points is frankly almost a waste of time.  Modeling done in DD has a marginal affect.  Modeling done from the beginning can guide the full measure of design decisions and help produce a very efficient design (as Nick alludes to below).  This is why we model.

 

On many of our projects we start modeling at the conceptual design phase to inform the development of the architecture, way before any load calculations are done.

eSim 2012 - Call For Abstracts

Next year, design professionals, academic researchers and students will
convene in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to discuss advances, challenges and
applications in building performance simulation. On May 2 and 3, 2012,
Dalhousie University will host the 7th biennial IBPSA-Canada conference
at the historic Pier-21 Museum on the Halifax Waterfront. 

     eSim 2012 will also coincide with the first annual meeting of the
recently announced NSERC Smart Net-Zero Energy Buildings Strategic
Research Network (SNEBRN).  The themes of the conference, as well as
pre- and post-conference workshops, will relate closely to the network
research priorities. 

     We invite you to submit original research on the development and
application of building performance simulation as it relates to building
energy use, environmental impacts and occupant well-being. Only original
papers related to the conference topics and not published elsewhere will
be accepted. All accepted papers accompanied by a conference
registration will be published in the conference proceedings and
presented at the conference in oral sessions. In the event that
submissions exceed the conference presentation quota, poster sessions
will be held to accommodate additional papers. Each registration
entitles the author to submit a single paper/poster. One additional
paper/poster per registration is allowed with a special fee.

Conference Themes

*       Recent developments for modelling the physical processes
relevant to building performance (thermal, air flow, moisture, lighting)

*       Methods and algorithms for modelling conventional and innovative
building systems (including envelope, lighting, controls, HVAC,
renewable energy and distributed generation systems)

*       Methods for modelling and characterizing whole building
performance, including interactions between systems within the
building, and interactions between the building and its surrounding
neighbourhood and community

*       Methods for modelling and characterizing occupant comfort and
wellbeing (including thermal comfort, acoustic performance, air-quality,
ventilation and lighting)  

*       Building simulation software development and quality control
approaches

*       Use of building simulation tools in building design,
optimization, code compliance and incentive programs

*       Use of building simulation tools in stock- and sector-modelling
studies at neighbourhood, community, municipal and national scales

*       Moving simulation into practice-case studies of innovative
simulation approaches

*       Validation of building simulation software

*       User interface and software interoperability issues

*       Architectural and engineering data visualization and animation

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Modeling Electric/Fossil Fuel Hybrid Boiler under ASHRAE
	90.1-1999
Message-ID: <DUB103-W636B84B30B20FE5D4BEB91E0170@phx.gbl>


Hey,
 
I am looking for help with regards to modeling a HVAC system under ASHRAE 90.1 
1999. I am trying to determine which baseline HVAC system type to choose, as the 
proposed model has a fossil fuel/electric hybrid boiler. Unlike 90.1 2007, where 
the Baseline HVAC System Types include a fossil/electric hybrid boiler system, 
it seems far more unclear under 1999. In Section 11.4.3 part k - (2) (page 59), 
it says that
 
"For systems with mixed fuel heating sources, the system or systems that 
use the secondary heating source type (the one with the smallest total installed 
capacity for the spaces served by the system) shall be modeled identically in 
the budget building design and the primary heating source type shall be 
used in Figure 11.4.3 to determine budget system type."
 
However in the building that I am modeling, it has a 850 kW electric boiler 
(lead boiler) with three further fossil fuel boilers with an installed capacity 
of 3000 kW for backup. So my understanding of the code above is; even though the 
electric boiler is the lead boiler in the proposed case, due to the fact that it 
has a smaller installed capacity than the fossil fuel boilers, it should be 
considered secondary, and thus the fossil fuel boilers will become the primary 
heat source and so I should be using a fossil fuel boiler to heat my baseline 
building. Does this seem correct? Also, I am unclear as to how I would be able 
to model the electric boiler "identically in 
the budget building design" as this is being 
used to supply all of the heat to the heating loop in the proposed case.
 
Any help and ideas would be greatly appreciated.
 
Thanks

Message-ID: <003f01cc6731$4a232f20$de698d60$@sudassociates.com>

Hi All,

 

I am doing an Appendix G model for LEED.  The proposed building uses a VRV
system where each room has individual control over its own VRV unit.  All of
the VRV units share 2 heat pumps.  My problem is this:  Since each room has
individual control, each room is a 'thermal block'.  I have combined as many
as I can according to the Appendix G rules.  However, I still have many
thermal blocks.  For the baseline, I am required to model a PSZ-HP (packaged
roof top unit heat pump) for each thermal block.  This is giving a bunch of
tiny rooms their own individual RTUs, which seems ridiculous and it is
driving my baseline energy use higher than reasonable (primarily in heating
energy.not sure why). 

 

I am modeling in TRACE, giving one SYSTEM per thermal block, and one PLANT
per SYSTEM.  If I am allowed to connect all of my systems to just one plant,
my energy use becomes more reasonable.but this seems to go against Appendix
G.

 

Has anyone come across this issue when modeling a baseline for a proposed
VRV system? 

 

Thanks,

Christian

Christian,
I have not seen this with a VRV system, but I've had a similar experience with a VAV system.  The LEED reviewer insisted thermal blocks be modeled identically in Baseline and Proposed.  That meant a Proposed bldg with 2 AHU's each with about 35 VAV terminal units became about 70 package units in the Baseline bldg.  Crazy, there is not enough roof space for 70 units.

Even though the Baseline systems do not always make sense, Appendix G attempts to make the energy models similar between everyone. It tries to standardize things for equal comparison.  That's my understanding.

I do have a question.  I'm not familiar with Trace.  In HAP only systems with heating or cooling coils can be added to a plant.  How is it that Trace allows DX units be added to a plant?  Seems you have a choice of multiple plants, one per system OR one plant for all systems.  I think you should choose the model that most accurately represents a PSZ-HP.

The queries posed are of two sorts:  TRACE/HAP specific and 90.1/LEED
specific.  I can address the latter variety as I'm primarily an eQuest
user:

-          Combining similar zones/blocks may save some time in setting
up the model (for any software package), but you may find it causes more
work in the long run as you may be required to document/justify why your
modeled systems are of a larger capacity than the proposed/actual units
- food for thought.

-          Many tiny RTU's may seem unreasonable from an
equipment-selection perspective (and often is), but the goal 90.1 is
trying to establish is to set an efficiency standard for such equipment,
as Reba is alluding to.  Note that G.3.1.1 has provisions to define
additional (per floor) baseline system types where that may be
appropriate.  That said...

-          If your baseline model is outputting a significantly
different energy distribution (suggested by your concern about heating
becoming the primary consumption), that's a likely sign something else
is off in one or both models.  Make some QC checks to ensure the
loads/schedules/ventilation rates and other items that are supposed to
be identical between the baseline/proposed are as such.  A check of
unmet hours may lead you down the same path.

-          As to the PLANT/SYSTEM relationships - that sounds
TRACE-specific to me.  You might hold out for responses from others on
this list more familiar with TRACE, or perhaps post a specific question
to the TRACE-users list as well.  FYI: it's not entirely clear how/why
the results are unreasonable or whether you're talking about your
proposed or baseline results from the context ;).

-          It may be helpful to remember that terms like "zone" "space"
"plant" and "system" can have software-specific meanings/nuances, so
what may seem perfectly reasonable for HAP may not jive with TRACE and
vice versa.  

 

Hope this helps somewhat =),

We are working on LEED certification for a school project in the south of
Chile.
The building has a wood pellet based biomass Boiler to provide heating.
Since the definition of the baseline system depends on the heating system of
the proposed building, I am wondering how to clasified the wood pellet
boiler.
The choices are:
1    fossil fuel,
2    electric or Other
Should I consider wood pellet as " Other " and therefore the baseline system
would be Electric?

Many Thanks,

Reba and Nick,

 

Thanks for the responses.  I believe I have resolved the issue.  Although it
is disconcerting to have such an unreasonable number of RTUs in the
baseline, this was actually not the major cause of my modeling issues.
However, it was causing part of the problem:  In TRACE, each new RTU comes
with a default amount of power associated with 'miscellaneous accessories'
(control panel and interlocks).  It's not a whole lot, but in the baseline
model this power allotment was added on over and over again (many RTUs),
while in the proposed model it is only added a couple of times.  I was able
to adjust this to more reasonable values.  This helped a good bit, but it
does not affect heating energy.  

 

As Nick suggests, the heating energy was not caused by the over-abundance of
RTUs at all.  I believe I actually identified the cause of this issue at
some point early on, but I'd forgotten what had caused what in my numerous
experimental iterations (another reminder to carefully document each change
and its result on the model!).  Sorry for any confusion there.  I hate
jumping the gun when posting a question.

 

To address the TRACE-specific plants/systems relationship:  In TRACE a
system refers to the distribution side of things and a plant is primarily
concerned with the generation of heating/cooling.  You have to specify a
plant to go with a system, even for a DX PSZ-HP.It is a little bit strange
to think of a packaged DX unit in this way, but TRACE has a well-defined
method of creating such configurations (the names for the systems and plants
are pretty clear).  In the case of a packaged unit, there should technically
be one plant for each system since the generation and distribution are tied
together in one unit and are independent of any other systems.    

 

I hope this makes sense.  I'm pretty new to TRACE, but I think my
explanation above is correct.  If anyone with more experience would like to
elaborate, feel free!

 

Thanks for your help,

Christian

The queries posed are of two sorts:  TRACE/HAP specific and 90.1/LEED
specific.  I can address the latter variety as I'm primarily an eQuest user:

-          Combining similar zones/blocks may save some time in setting up
the model (for any software package), but you may find it causes more work
in the long run as you may be required to document/justify why your modeled
systems are of a larger capacity than the proposed/actual units - food for
thought.

-          Many tiny RTU's may seem unreasonable from an equipment-selection
perspective (and often is), but the goal 90.1 is trying to establish is to
set an efficiency standard for such equipment, as Reba is alluding to.  Note
that G.3.1.1 has provisions to define additional (per floor) baseline system
types where that may be appropriate.  That said.

-          If your baseline model is outputting a significantly different
energy distribution (suggested by your concern about heating becoming the
primary consumption), that's a likely sign something else is off in one or
both models.  Make some QC checks to ensure the loads/schedules/ventilation
rates and other items that are supposed to be identical between the
baseline/proposed are as such.  A check of unmet hours may lead you down the
same path.

-          As to the PLANT/SYSTEM relationships - that sounds TRACE-specific
to me.  You might hold out for responses from others on this list more
familiar with TRACE, or perhaps post a specific question to the TRACE-users
list as well.  FYI: it's not entirely clear how/why the results are
unreasonable or whether you're talking about your proposed or baseline
results from the context ;).

-          It may be helpful to remember that terms like "zone" "space"
"plant" and "system" can have software-specific meanings/nuances, so what
may seem perfectly reasonable for HAP may not jive with TRACE and vice
versa.  

 

Hope this helps somewhat =),

Christian,

I have not seen this with a VRV system, but I've had a similar experience
with a VAV system.  The LEED reviewer insisted thermal blocks be modeled
identically in Baseline and Proposed.  That meant a Proposed bldg with 2
AHU's each with about 35 VAV terminal units became about 70 package units in
the Baseline bldg.  Crazy, there is not enough roof space for 70 units.

 

Even though the Baseline systems do not always make sense, Appendix G
attempts to make the energy models similar between everyone. It tries to
standardize things for equal comparison.  That's my understanding.

 

I do have a question.  I'm not familiar with Trace.  In HAP only systems
with heating or cooling coils can be added to a plant.  How is it that Trace
allows DX units be added to a plant?  Seems you have a choice of multiple
plants, one per system OR one plant for all systems.  I think you should
choose the model that most accurately represents a PSZ-HP.

Hi All,

 

I am doing an Appendix G model for LEED.  The proposed building uses a VRV
system where each room has individual control over its own VRV unit.  All of
the VRV units share 2 heat pumps.  My problem is this:  Since each room has
individual control, each room is a 'thermal block'.  I have combined as many
as I can according to the Appendix G rules.  However, I still have many
thermal blocks.  For the baseline, I am required to model a PSZ-HP (packaged
roof top unit heat pump) for each thermal block.  This is giving a bunch of
tiny rooms their own individual RTUs, which seems ridiculous and it is
driving my baseline energy use higher than reasonable (primarily in heating
energy.not sure why). 

 

I am modeling in TRACE, giving one SYSTEM per thermal block, and one PLANT
per SYSTEM.  If I am allowed to connect all of my systems to just one plant,
my energy use becomes more reasonable.but this seems to go against Appendix
G.

 

Has anyone come across this issue when modeling a baseline for a proposed
VRV system? 

 

Thanks,

Christian

As a wood boiler is essentially a replacement for a fossil fuel boiler, I
have created a fossil fuel baseline for such projects in the past.
