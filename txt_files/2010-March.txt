I'm interested in natural ventilation. Has anyone used NIST FDS or OpenFOAM
to successfully model natural ventilation?
Are there any open source programs out there capable of this?
Any recommendations for natural ventilation modeling references?

Shariq,

We have successfully used IES (www.iesve.com) for bulk flow analysis in
naturally ventilated buildings.  Maybe someone else is familiar with an
open-source package capable of modeling natural ventilation with
acceptable accuracy.  

 

Some good sources to review are:

Natural Ventilation in Buildings

Natural Ventilation in the Urban Environment

Ventilation of Buildings

ASHRAE Fundamentals

 

Hope this is helpful.

Tim

Shariq

We have used NIST to carry out evaluations of nat vent designs fairly  
successfully. Obviously it goes without saying that boundary  
conditions are very important here. We have open foam as well but  
haven't carried out nat vent designs in it yet.

Similarly to IES the offering from Designbuilder is a good tool which  
we have used a number of times for such buildings. It uses the  
energyplus simulation engine and the results of your simulation can be  
linked to the CFD model.

I am due to give a webinar on the 23 march on it's use for this  
purpose and I would suggest it might be useful for you to register for  
it. I believe further details are available on the designbuilder  
website (www.DesignBuilder.co.uk).  This software is very  
competetively priced and has a very intuitive GUI & modelling process.

ESPr might offer another option but I can't offer any advice on it's  
Cfd capabilities though I do believe it has them albeit fairly crude.   
It's thermal modelling engine is open source and it has some advanced  
modelling capabilities beyond many commercial tools. It's user  
interface is in my own opinion quite hard to use.  But if you are  
happy with nist and openfoam my guess us that text based modelling  
doesn't phase you.

Hope this is helpful.

Hi Leen,

I used to have Esp-r on my old Powerbook, and it was fully supported and 
running fine. I do not know about a .ddd-debugger or TRNSYS.

Leen,
We recently learned that NREL (the National Renewable Energy Lab) here 
in the US has a version of TRNSYS that runs under the Mac OS. I don't 
know much about it and I know that neither the Studio nor the online 
plot will run outside of the Windows OS.

OK - from a local LA boy, but a Fighting Illini..

Go back into the Detailed Edit Mode and see what loads are displayed as Miscellaneous. Check the Utilities tab and see if there are ant outdoor or dirct electric loads that are displayed as miscellaneous.

You could always send the .INP and .PD2 files for us to look at.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Enquiry about market value after LEED Certification
Message-ID: <206485.99345.qm@web59812.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Dear ALL
?
I am writing to inquire whether?after USGBC ?LEED Certification, Owner or Developer can increase the selling price for their project. At present, I am handling more than 66 active LEED projects and in every Technical meeting and Eco charrete, the client and developers are interested to know the benefits of LEED Certification mainly in terms of cost/selling price and also how to increase the market value of the project. 
As for the present, a new resolution on the implementation of green building specifications and standards in the Emirate of Dubai has been issued by H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Vice-President and Prime Minister of UAE and Ruler of Dubai. As per the new resolution, effective January 2008, all owners of residential and commercial buildings and properties in the emirate of Dubai must comply with the internationally recognized environment friendly specifications to turn Dubai into a healthy city that meets the demands of best practices and benchmarks of pollution-free sustainable development. The said resolution will boost Dubai?s continuous efforts to promote global endeavors to face environmental challenges, Chairman of The Executive Office Mohammed Abdullah ?Al ?Gergawi ?said ?citing ?efforts ?by ?Dubai? to? bring? climate change and global warming under control. This was published in The Emirates News Agency, WAM (Wakalat
 Anba?a al-Emarat), Oct. 24, 2007.
?
Due to the economic crisis, clients seem to be more interested and constantly wondering on the future benefit they will be gaining from making their building green.
?
Furthermore, some clients are getting interested in green business and joining USGBC membership. We would appreciate if you could provide us any document or explanation to answer such inquiry from the client. Could you send us some information about the market value of the projects after LEED certification? ?I am looking forward to receiving your reply.

Yours faithfully,
?
?
?
? Thanks and Regards
?Krishnaji Pawar LEED? AP?

Hi,

has anyone experience with the basic and advanced courses of openfaom? They
are expensive, so before sending some of the PhD students, we wanted to know
the value of these courses...

Thanks for any input!

Message-ID: <08754FA64A074B308E8C3A688EEEC5C3@alibaba>

Dear All,

This is not a question about simulation, but since there are many people experienced with LEED, I thought it would be a good place to post.

If our LEED project is the renovation of an existing building, where
- Roof insulation has been increased on 25 % of the existing roof area, increasing average roof U factor from 0,68 W/m2K to 0,35 W/m2K
- Existing chiller, boiler and piping has been kept, but all fan coil units have been replaced,
- 9500 m3/h air handling unit has been kept, total 13500 m3/h new air handling units (ERV) have been installed,
- A new VRF system serving 15% of total conditioned area has been installed,
- Interior of the building has been totally demolished and renovated, including structural reinforcements.

Which rating system would you choose for certification?

I would appreciate any answers,

I and one of our junior research staff have attended the basic and
advanced courses run with SGI. They were useful in that i.) they save
time by speeding up the initial learning curve ii) there are tips and
tricks to learn that are not in the user guides iii) the course
materials are good and I refer to them quite often now. They are
expensive and so whether you decide to go depends on how you value your
time. I decided to learn from the user guide and tutorials and then go
on the advanced course i.e. skip the basic stuff. If I needed to get PhD
students going I would probably, having been on the advanced course
myself, run something similar internally. I don't remember any PhD
students on the course - mostly industry. I highly recommend OpenFOAM
and have found it very efficient in parallel processing compared to
commercial codes. 

 

Regards,

Simon

Hi,

 

has anyone experience with the basic and advanced courses of openfaom?
They are expensive, so before sending some of the PhD students, we
wanted to know the value of these courses...

 

Thanks for any input!

Hi Omer,

Based on your explanation, it is most likely LEED NC if the owner occupies
more than 50%. Another option is LEED CS if the owner does not have control
over interior area. I usually do side by side analysis to determine which
one is the best for the project.

Thanks

Hi there,

I am responding to some LEED review comments regarding a small
building in Hawaii that only has 2 thermal zones. In reality one of
these zones is conditioned (small split system cooling only) and one
zone is unconditioned (naturally ventilated, no heating or cooling).
The LEED reviewer writes:

"ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Table G3.1.1(b) in the proposed building column
requires that all spaces that are conditioned and occupied in the
proposed design should be simulated as being both heated and cooled
even if no cooling or heating systems are to be installed per Table
G3.1.1(b) in the proposed building column." - this comment makes sense
per G3.1.1b.

The comment continues "Based on the building area, number of floors,
and principal heating source, system type 4: packaged rooftop heat
pump should be modeled for the unconditioned spaces and heating
component of system type 4: packaged rooftop heat pump should be
modeled for the conditioned office spaces unit. Please revise the
proposed and baseline models by modeling the same system type in both
cases in the unconditioned spaces and include heating equipment for
the conditioned office spaces." This second comments seems to say that
I need to put System Type 4 in the unconditioned space in both the
baseline and the proposed model ... does this seem to correct to
others?

If so, it seems to imply that you can never truly have an
unconditioned space in a LEED model? As a workaround, I plan to then
put the setpoints for cooling and heating such that those installed
systems will never turn on (which makes me wonder why a system should
be installed). If I don't do wide setpoints, my proposed model will
not be representative of the actual energy use of the design building.

Any thoughts on this topic would be much appreciated.

Caroline,

I'd argue that the space is unconditioned and requires no heating or
cooling, provided it really is "unconditioned" per the ASHRAE
definition. (See below.)

Per the ASHRAE 90.1 User's Manual (2004 & 2007), p. G-21, regarding
requirements for modeling both heating and cooling:

"This requirement only applies to conditioned space in the building.
Semiheated spaces would only have a heating system; unconditioned spaces
would have neither heating nor cooling systems."

Your "unconditioned zone" meets the ASHRAE definition (see p.13 in the
Standard) unless it is an "enclosed space...heated or cooled indirectly
by being connected to adjacent spaces" and receives 3 air changes per
hour of transfer air.

Bill

Caroline,

I agree with Bill's remarks and you should first see if you can define
that space as "unconditioned" per ASHRAE's definition to get out of the
requirement all together. 

All,

I wanted to see what others peoples thoughts are when we have these
conditioned spaces and must provide heating or cooling even if we really
do not have them in proposed design per Table G3.1, 10. HVAC system. I
have used the method Caroline mentions of raising or lowering set points
in these "non-existing" systems to reduce or eliminate any effect on
simulation comparison.  This seems like a good approach, just wondering
if anyone else thinks this is a valid way to go about this?  A common
case for us would be a data room, where cooling is only provided or a
mechanical equipment room where heating is only provided and heating
output capacity is above the 3.4 Btu/h-sf.

In Table G 3.1 5(f) - I says that the baseline shall reflect work done

Subject: [Bldg-sim] three questions about how to size HVAC equpment and
	systems in building design
Message-ID: <213283.88803.qm@web24006.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Dear All,
 
I have three problems about how to size HVAC equipment. Any advice
would be appreciated.
 
1: The peak cooling load is usually calculated by using 1% or 0.4% dry
bulb temperature and daily temperature range from the historical data. In building
energy simulation, we usually use typical year weather data. If there are still
many (for example, above 300 hours) unmet hours for cooling in a large office
building after you make sure that all the inputs for models are reasonable, you
will increase system coil or plant capacity. Or you just think the unmet hours for
cooling may be highly dependent on software or other factors. Then we can usually ignore
it. For unmet hours for heating in building performance simulation, this seems not to be a problem as the internal
heat gains are usually assumed to be zero in sizing heating equipment. 
 
2: In sizing HVAC systems and equipment, is it common to use operative
temperature? I found that the results (capacity of boiler and chiller) will be
very different by using air and operative temperature for a building with a
high window-wall-ratio. 
 
3: Urban heat island is well documented in the literature. But it seems
it is still not clear how to consider this urbanization effect in choosing heating
and cooling design temperature for HVAC equipment. Do you think this is because
this temperature differences are too small to consider in building design? This
may be related to another problem: how the final cooling coil, fan, pump, and
chiller capacity is sensitivity to the external dry bulb temperature for
cooling design. For example, the 0.4% and 1% dry bulb temperatures are 93.8 F and
91.5 F in Atlanta. This temperature difference (2.3 F) will lead to obvious
differences in HVAC equipment capacity for a large office building. Or other
factors (like safety factors) have more significant influences on final choice
of HVAC equipment? How does the uncertainty in cooling design temperature
affect the HVAC system and plant capacity in building design?
 
Thank you in advance,
 
Jim Terry

Caroline:

Good morning.  I'd agree with Bill. 

Per the definitions in section 3.2 of 90.1, a cooled space (and heated
space for your climate zone in particular) is defined as a space that
contains a cooling (heating) system with a sensible output exceeding 5
btu/sf.  Since you have no heating or cooling systems, I would classify
your space as unconditioned.  If it is unconditioned, the comment
regarding table G3.1.1(b) doesn't apply since it specifically mentions
conditioned spaces.

Caroline,

Our assumption is that this provision was created to avoid giving projects credit for eliminating air conditioning on a project for energy savings without providing reasonable means for thermal comfort for occupants.  We have been involved in a number of warehouse projects that have the same problem, since warehouses are rarely air-conditioned and only some meet the definition of semi-heated spaces.

Be sure to note the following CIR issued by the EA TAG when you provide your response as it justifies your temperature setpoints (we usually print a PDF from the USGBC website and submit that PDF as a supporting document):

The owner strongly desires to be sustainable and will use many sustainable features whether or not LEED certification is sought. We will use high efficiency lighting and high efficiency infrared heaters, but no cooling. If we use the ASHRAE appendix G, we have to model the baseline cooling system for the baseline and the proposed.

Since the cooling energy will be much larger than the heating energy the 14% reduction from ASHRAE will not be possible. This force the project to be penalized for energy never actually used. In this case we feel that the ASHRAE standard does not rationally apply.

This project will reuse a large facility and incorporate significant sustainability features and we would not like to be excluded because the ASHRAE standard does not apply logically to this facility.

Is there any alternative method for compliance in this situation? 
  
4/14/2009 -  Ruling
The project has requested clarification regarding the use of the ASHRAE Baseline requirements in Appendix G. Although a cooling system must be modeled in both the Baseline and Design case, there are no requirements for Temperature Setpoint. Therefore, both cases may have the Cooling Temperature Setpoint elevated such that both systems do not ever run and thus does not consume any energy.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Unconditioned Zones

Hi there,

I am responding to some LEED review comments regarding a small
building in Hawaii that only has 2 thermal zones. In reality one of
these zones is conditioned (small split system cooling only) and one
zone is unconditioned (naturally ventilated, no heating or cooling).
The LEED reviewer writes:

"ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Table G3.1.1(b) in the proposed building column
requires that all spaces that are conditioned and occupied in the
proposed design should be simulated as being both heated and cooled
even if no cooling or heating systems are to be installed per Table
G3.1.1(b) in the proposed building column." - this comment makes sense
per G3.1.1b.

The comment continues "Based on the building area, number of floors,
and principal heating source, system type 4: packaged rooftop heat
pump should be modeled for the unconditioned spaces and heating
component of system type 4: packaged rooftop heat pump should be
modeled for the conditioned office spaces unit. Please revise the
proposed and baseline models by modeling the same system type in both
cases in the unconditioned spaces and include heating equipment for
the conditioned office spaces." This second comments seems to say that
I need to put System Type 4 in the unconditioned space in both the
baseline and the proposed model ... does this seem to correct to
others?

If so, it seems to imply that you can never truly have an
unconditioned space in a LEED model? As a workaround, I plan to then
put the setpoints for cooling and heating such that those installed
systems will never turn on (which makes me wonder why a system should
be installed). If I don't do wide setpoints, my proposed model will
not be representative of the actual energy use of the design building.

Any thoughts on this topic would be much appreciated.

Caroline

Lucky,
 You might look at the University of Wisconsin - Madison Dept. of 
Engineering Professional Development. They offer a 2-day course twice a 
year on energy modeling for high performance buildings that talks about 
some of the underlying issues of energy modeling as well as giving you 
some experience with a specific piece of software.

Hi all,

I need to verify the simulation results with empirical results in a testbed.
I have modeled the building in EnergyPlus, and now try to find the weather
information of that corresponding date. However, the latest date of the
real-time weather on EnergyPlus website is 12/09/2009. The station ID of my
site is KCHO.

Is there any way to find the latest weather data that can run with
EnergyPlus? Thank you very much.

Jiakang-

Besides NCDC data, I would suggest NWS METAR data 
<http://weather.noaa.gov/weather/metar.shtml>.  It is updated hourly, 
however, I believe the oldest data readily available is 24hrs.   It has 
many of the weather variables needed for hourly simulations, the biggest 
exception is solar data (only sky cover and visibility are reported for 
most stations).  However, you could probably generate estimated solar 
data using one of the sky model algorithms that have been developed; I 
don't believe the EnergyPlus weather file program will yet generate 
solar data for you from sky cover (please correct me if I am wrong).

A nifty program I recently found for automatically downloading this data 
real-time is call METARs Downloader (I have no affiliation with the 
vendor).   I am quite satisfied with this software, although I think 
there are others available or you could create your own.

Lynn:
 
Hope it's not too late to comment on your recent request for input... I've
been thinking about it for a few weeks and here are my thoughts - boiled
down. 
 
Although these topics are not 'technical' modeling topics that you may have
been looking for, when it comes to growing the market for energy simulation
in the existing building environment I feel that these are fundamental
building blocks that we, as practicioners, need a solid foundation to build
upon and grow a customer base from. For me, it all comes down to using
appropriate modeling tools to make a financial case that investing in energy
efficiency is a (safe, wise, profitable) investment compared to alternative
investments within an understood tolerance of savings uncertainty. Some of
this amounts to 'financial' engineering, which is another layer of analysis
that I believe needs to be integrated into energy analysis procedures.  
 
Content:
 
1) An Educational Session of Understanding Savings Uncertainty as it relates
to Calibrated Energy Simulation 
    * A primer on how ASHRAE Guideline 14 defines calibration metrics and
"savings uncertainty" for the Whole Building Calibrated Simulation path. 
    * Guidance on how to explain to clients how the 'quality' of actual
baseline energy data (motthly bills, large CV-RMSE, vs day-typed interval
meters with small CV-RMSE) largely determines achievable uncertainty limits,
and how additonal investment for submetering is required if resulting
uncertainty is unacceptable
 
2) An Educational Session on speaking the language of investment - to those
that invest. 
    * An understanding of how different capital improvements (and associated
energy cost reductions) effect an organization's income statement differenty
- such as EBIT and EBITDA. 
    * An understanding of how the financial positioning of a firm (strong in
cash, highly leveraged, etc.) make certain investments more attractive
regardless of model energy savings predictions. 
 
3) An Educational Session on Financial Risk Management as it applies to
Energy Modeling. 
    * An understanding of how analysis tools such as parametrics, monte
carlo techniques, etc. can be used to generate multi-dimensional ways of
viewing potential investments in energy efficiency from an investment risk
management perspective, which quantify the potential for up-side as well as
downside risk in a stochiometric manner. 
 
Location:
    * Chicago (central location, both east and west coast folks likely able
to travel in one day)
    * CYBERSPACE - I also like ASHRAE's digital delivery method that was
pioneered at the Orlando meeting for seminars, etc. My thoughts are to make
events like this as accessible as possible to the largest possible audience,
by providing options for delivering the content cost effectively and letting
people choose.
 
 
All the Best,

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED baseline and swimming pools
Message-ID: <012101cabf07$5bb56010$13202030$@net>

Dear Bldg-Sim community,

 

I'm trying to plan a LEED energy model which has a swimming pool and am
stuck thinking about how to model the baseline condition.

 

A pool has such specialized needs that I have doubts whether one of the
specified baseline systems in ASHRAE 90.1 can do an acceptable job of
controlling temperature and humidity.

 

At present, I am reasonably confident that I can schedule the pool occupancy
properly, add  moisture in amounts that parallel the pool evaporation and
specify the pool heater energy.  

 

My facility requires a "System 6" parallel fan powered VAV box HVAC system
(95,000 sq.ft., single story, multi-purpose facility).  This is not a system
type that makes sense for a pool, so I hesitate to use it at all.  If I have
to, for purposes of following 90.1, I think it might meet temperature loads,
but it certainly won't meet humidity loads, at least not at the specified
20F airside delta T.  That, of course means that overall energy use will not
even be close to what will actually be needed and the baseline will compare
poorly with the actual (very efficient) HVAC system.

 

I'll appreciate any guidance from those among you who have done LEED
projects with pools!

 

Thanks in advance.

James,
I suggest looking at the exceptions to the baseline system type table in section G3.1.1.  A latent load differential criteria would be a nice but it is not there so here's hoping one of the criteria there gives you a reasonable and manageable comparison.

James,
I was involved in modeling an Aquatic Center recently. This was not a LEED
project but a utility DSM project but I think our approach would be
applicable. We assumed that the pool space was a process space. For this
case, the proposed design system and controls should be of the same type in
both the baseline and the proposed design. In our project, we took credit
for a controls innovation that modulated outside air based on indoor
humidity level instead of outside air (as is allowed through an exceptional
calculation method by LEED).

 I developed a spreadsheet to complete a mass and energy balance on the
space and figured out the outside air for each hour of the day throughout
the year based on the proposed control strategy. Then I developed an 8760
schedule for outside air and used it with the proposed model.

To figure out the latent losses from the pool to the space, we followed the
Shah Method (do a google search and  you'll find a spreadsheet of the
method). The results seemed to be more modest than those following the
ASHRAE method. However, both were high when compared to values used for
solar thermal system sizing (by the solar contractor). As I matter of fact,
I couldn't "turn down" the Shah model far enough to get close to those
values, which were about 1/2. In contrast, the mechanical engineers design
values were about double the Shah Method results. It was very frustrating to
go through such a detailed analysis only to be unsure of actual latent lose
values. In the end, I modified the Shah method results so they would be
consistent with the solar contractor's annual load estimate. The contractor
had done several local installations that delivered as expected.

Part of the analysis considered the impact of having the pool covered vs
having a solar thermal system that met 60% of the annual load. This is part
of the ASHRAE 90.1-2004, which the project needed to adhere to. This adds a
little extra through regarding scheduling the latent losses in doing the
modeling.

Good luck. This is one area of modeling that could surely use some help. But
based on my mixed results, I don't know if you want to follow the path I
did.

Lynn,

 

I would suggest sessions on dynamic thermal simulation of challenging spaces and system types. 

 

I suggest these because they are potentially valuable strategies for low-energy and net-zero-energy designs, yet they are often shied away from, not because they aren't good strategies, but because many engineers have a difficult time either understanding them well enough to confidently implement them and/or model them well enough to quantify their potential benefits in a particular building, climate, etc. While CFD can provide very helpful information regarding thermal performance, this is just for one particular slice in time and also depends upon getting the boundary conditions correct. The latter may require a model that is dynamic with respect to changing loads, interaction with space conditioning systems, etc. Additionally, the dynamic model is needed to determine how well thermal comfort will be maintained as conditions vary and how much energy will be consumed in doing so. 

 

Topics should include the following:

 

?         Thermally stratified spaces such as atria for which solar gain, stratification, radiation from warm/hot surfaces, and thermal plumes will be significant contributors to thermal comfort and energy consumption for space conditioning. 



?         Spaces served by underfloor air distribution (UFAD), including both core zones and perimeter zones and the transition from cooling to heating mode, particularly with respect to a shift in the extent of thermal stratification vs. mixing in perimeter zones.



?         Double-skin facades, accounting for convection, re-radiation, and subsequent transmission of heat from operable interstitial blinds suspended within the fa?ade cavity.



?         Solar chimneys and earth tubes or labyrinths accounting for both the heat transfer to/from air flowing through these passages and the stack effects they may contribute to in ventilating or conditioning spaces in a building.



?         Hydronic radiant slab cooling systems, accounting for the affects of thermal mass, hydronic tube placement (spacing and depth in the slab), water flow rate and temperature, pump energy, system controls, and the influences that each of these have on cooling capacity and energy consumption. This should include modeling of outside-air ventilation systems and surface temperature sensing and controls to avoid condensation on chilled surfaces. 



?         Mixed-mode operation involving coordination of BAS-controlled natural ventilation openings, user-controlled openings, CO2-based demand-controlled mechanical ventilation, and thermally driven capability for overriding natural ventilation with mechanical means when it is insufficient.



?         HVAC systems including desiccant wheel dried by waste heat from the condenser coil on a DX unit that provides dehumidification and cooling of outside air in series with the desiccant (units such as this are becoming more common).



?         HVAC systems incorporating indirect evaporative cooling and a desiccant wheel dried by either solar heat or waste heat from a combined heat & power system.



?         Variable-refrigerant-volume (VRV) systems that include a common refrigerant loop, and thus capability for moving heat from zones that need cooling to zones that require heat.

Timothy

Hi all,

My company is looking at making available some BIM models as well as compiling data on our windows to help energy modelers analyze our windows and glass into buildings.

The ones that seem most obvious to me are:

 *   COG U-factor
 *   Full Frame U-factor
 *   COG SHGC/SC (do people prefer one or are both useful?)
 *   Full Frame SHGC
 *   VT
 *   Thickness

I feel like some software requires more detailed inputs, so I've come up with the additional categories:

 *   Visible Transmittance by color
 *   Visible Reflectance Front and Back
 *   Solar Transmittance
 *   Solar  Reflectance Front and Back
 *   UV transmittance

Please feel free to add and comment on this list. Our purpose of providing this data is to make consultants' lives easier so let me know if you think of anything that would be helpful. Thanks for your input!

Regards,
Alex Krickx

I would concur on your additional bullets to include VT by color (or
color filter information) and 2-sides of visible reflectances and solar
reflectance would be a good idea based on daylighting studies I've done
in the past, particularly when site reflective sources are being
accounted for.  I've yet to attempt including such things in my models
but I expect I will be coming across a model warranting that
investigation sooner or later.

Hi all,

 

My company is looking at making available some BIM models as well as
compiling data on our windows to help energy modelers analyze our
windows and glass into buildings.

 

The ones that seem most obvious to me are:

*	COG U-factor
*	Full Frame U-factor
*	COG SHGC/SC (do people prefer one or are both useful?)
*	Full Frame SHGC
*	VT
*	Thickness

 

I feel like some software requires more detailed inputs, so I've come up
with the additional categories:

*	Visible Transmittance by color 
*	Visible Reflectance Front and Back
*	Solar Transmittance
*	Solar  Reflectance Front and Back
*	UV transmittance

 

Please feel free to add and comment on this list. Our purpose of
providing this data is to make consultants' lives easier so let me know
if you think of anything that would be helpful. Thanks for your input!

 

Regards,

Alex Krickx

Dear Alex,

 

The best way (currently) to supply information about your windows for use in
energy simulation programs would be to generate DOE-2 and EnergyPlus report
files from WINDOW program.  One caveat is that DOE-2 report file cannot be
generated for the real window frames, but you can use average U-factor for
your actual frames and create a generic frames that can be used in DOE-2
report.  That way you can circumvent this deficiency in DOE-2 functionality.
EnergyPlus report does not have this deficiency.  For other simulation
programs, it is hard to say what they would need, but generally the
following is important information about a window (all included in
EnergyPlus report file):

 

-          Glazing 

o   Center of glazing system conductance

o   Center of glazing U-factor

o   Convective and radiative portions of outdoor and indoor film
coefficients

o   Number of glazing layers

o   Center of glazing SHGC as a function of angle of incidence, including
hemispherical

o   Center of glazing T_sol as a function of angle of incidence, including
hemispherical

o   Center of glazing Rf_sol as a function of angle of incidence, including
hemispherical

o   Center of glazing Rb_sol as a function of angle of incidence, including
hemispherical

o   Center of glazing T_vis as a function of angle of incidence, including
hemispherical

o   Center of glazing Rf_vis as a function of angle of incidence, including
hemispherical

o   Center of glazing Rb_vis as a function of angle of incidence, including
hemispherical

o   Center of glazing Layer absorptances

o   Size of the transparent area (Width and Height)

-          Frame:

o   Projected framing depth for each cross-section

o   Outside projection

o   Conductance

o   Edge of glazing conductance

o   Surface absorptivity

o   Surface emissivity

 

It would be also helpful if detailed layer by layer properties of glazing is
supplied (i.e., solar-optical spectral properties of individual layers of
glazing, meaning solar-optical properties as a function of wavelength, each
glazing layer thickness, conductivity and two surface emissivities), gap
fill thermo-physical properties and gap widths.

Colleagues,
  The topics that are being proposed for an energy modeling conference 
are all excellent and relevant; the more information dissemination the 
better. In case some are unaware, I would add that the IBPSA 
(International Building Performance and Simulation Association: 
http://www.ibpsa.org) focuses specifically on all these issues and puts 
on a world conference on odd years (2007 in Beijing, 2009 in Glasgow, 
2011 in Wellington, New Zealand). On even years, both the US and 
Canadian chapters hold conferences which are routinely well attended and 
present a great deal of very relevant work on all of the topics that 
have been suggested. This summer's Canadian meeting is May 19/20 in 
Winnipeg. This summer's US meeting is in New York Aug 11-13.
Best,
 David

Dear all:

 

Some of you and/or your associates might be interested in a three day
executive education program on 'Daylighting Buildings' that we will be
offering on July 14-16 2010 at Harvard University, Graduate School of
Design. During the three days we will be covering a range of daylighting
design analysis techniques ranging from rules of thumb to
state-of-the-art computer simulations and high dynamic range photography
for glare analysis. The main simulation programs used will be
Rhinoceros, SketchUp, and/or Ecotect for CAD modeling as well as
Radiance, Daysim, Evalglare, and Photosphere for climate-based daylight
modeling, glare analysis and solar radiation assessments. You can sign
up for the program at

Does anyone know where I can buy/find 2009 hourly solar data for US Cities?
I'm specifically looking for 2009 Solar Data for New Haven, CT and I need
"Global Horizontal Radiation" and "Direct normal Radiation".

Eric-

I do not think that NREL provides hourly data from 2009. The links on that
page are all average monthly. The only other place I would think to look
would be the National Solar Radiation Data Base (
http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/hourly/siteonthefly.cgi?id=725045)
but that only provides data up to 2005.

Any thoughts?

Steve

There are a variety of alternate sources for solar radiation data that are
collected by state and federal agencies.  CIMIS is a great source for
weather data in California, and there is a similar network in Arizona, whose
name escapes me at the moment. We have successfully built weather files
for eQuest using both. You are likely to have a hard time finding
measured direct normal solar radiation data for New Haven -- that's a
difficult measurement to take and there aren't all that many sites (I think
NOAA measures this at something like 50 sites across the US, then there are
various somewhat random research stations that might give you additional
options).  Are you sure you need measured direct normal solar?  That isn't
likely to be any more useful modeled direct normal solar based on global
horizontal solar and date/time/lat/long.

Sorry, I don't have a direct answer for you, but if you hunt around, you
should be able to find some horizontal solar data that's not too far off
from your location.

Hello,

Does anyone have ComEd and People's Gas rates available for a small
commercial business in Chicago, IL?  I have tried their websites and
customer service, but can't seem to get through to any useful information.
If any of you in the Chicago area can pass on the following info, it will be
greatly appreciated:

Electric:

monthly fees

schedule of on-peak and off-peak hours

$/KW and $/kwh for both on and off-peak

taxes and additional fees


Gas:

I have a summary of charges, but the website lists various additional
charges, with no associated rate (Environmental charge, Infrastructure Cost
Recovery Charge, taxes, and other fees).  If anyone can provide information
regarding these additional fees, I would appreciate it.

Thanks!

You can also download data from a Web site like www.wunderground.com which
keeps historical weather data.  I've used the attached spreadsheet and
accompanying macro  (which may have come from someone on this or the
EnergyPlus list, but I forgot.)

I've stumped myself!

 

When building a baseline model using 90.1-2004 or 2007, what envelope
construction properties should we use for floors exposed to the
exterior?  

 

I'm currently planning on the "if all else fails match the proposed"
route, but does there exist any guidance from ASHRAE or other sources
regarding what the baseline case would be for such envelope elements?

Ah... it's been too long since I reviewed the glossary!

 

Lately I've been assuming "Floors" in the envelope table meant interior
floors only...

Appendix G indicates Baseline Building "Floors" are to be Steel-joist. Refer to Climate Building Envelope Requirement tables in Section 5 and use U-factor for Steel-joist Floor for your climate zone.

Greetings, I am having problems importing dxf files into Hevacomp V8i.  I installed windows 7 recently; I did not have this problem on XP pro.  When installing (and re-installing) I did have UAC turned off, and resolved the issues with the .ink files.  But I have not been able to get past this error.

After I choose the file and fill in these fields I get the following error.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] thoughts on App G system type for mixed use building
Message-ID: <4A015401026CF44ABCC4D2A6A467AA1806C36E@EXCHANGE1.cadd_group.ghtltd.com>

I've got a 92,000 square foot Industrial building that I am modeling.
If you went by Table G3.1.1A, the baseline system type would be System 5
- Packaged VAV with reheat.

 

However, of the 92,000 square feet, approximately 16,000 sq ft is
conditioned to standard 75/72 degrees, while the remainder is a mixture
of storage, manufacturing, etc, and is heated to 55 and cooled to 120
(no actual cooling in proposed model, but you've got to insert some sort
of cooling system per App G).

 

So I really have 16,000 sq ft that is fully conditioned, and 76,000 sq
ft that is only partially conditioned (ie the peak thermal load differs
by 10 Btu/h-ft2).  

 

Any guesses how I configure this?

 

Do I have a packaged VAV system for the 76,000 sq ft of shop/storage and
isolate the 16,000 ft2 of real conditioned space as system 3 per the
Exception to G3.1.1?  

 

Or do I have a packaged VAV system for the 16,000 ft conditioned space
and isolate the 76,000 sq ft as system 3?

 

To further complicate things, since the 76,000 sq ft is split between
storage and manufacturing, where there is theoretically an operating
schedule that differs by 40 hours or more a week between these two
different use types, do I actually just end up with ALL system 3 even
though the total net building area is above the 75,000 sq ft cutoff
where we're supposed to go to System 5?

 

I'm confused!  Any help would be appreciated.

 

To recap:

 

16,000 sq ft office, heated/cooled to 72/75

30,000 sq ft of storage with basically no operating hours per week,
heated/cooled to 50/120

36,000 sq ft of manufacturing / workshop area that is used approximately
50 hrs a week, heated/cooled to 50/120

 

Mixture of System 3 and System 5, or ALL system 3?

Hi James,

It sounds like the storage and workshop area may be semi-heated as defined by Section 3.  I'd recommend looking into that.  If the spaces are semi-heated then they should be modeled only with heating in the baseline case and the requirements of Table G3.1.10 don't apply.  It's also worth noting that if the spaces are semi-heated they should be modeled with different envelope values in the baseline case (based on the semi-heated in Table 5.5).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] thoughts on App G system type for mixed use building

I've got a 92,000 square foot Industrial building that I am modeling.  If you went by Table G3.1.1A, the baseline system type would be System 5 - Packaged VAV with reheat.

However, of the 92,000 square feet, approximately 16,000 sq ft is conditioned to standard 75/72 degrees, while the remainder is a mixture of storage, manufacturing, etc, and is heated to 55 and cooled to 120 (no actual cooling in proposed model, but you've got to insert some sort of cooling system per App G).

So I really have 16,000 sq ft that is fully conditioned, and 76,000 sq ft that is only partially conditioned (ie the peak thermal load differs by 10 Btu/h-ft2).

Any guesses how I configure this?

Do I have a packaged VAV system for the 76,000 sq ft of shop/storage and isolate the 16,000 ft2 of real conditioned space as system 3 per the Exception to G3.1.1?

Or do I have a packaged VAV system for the 16,000 ft conditioned space and isolate the 76,000 sq ft as system 3?

To further complicate things, since the 76,000 sq ft is split between storage and manufacturing, where there is theoretically an operating schedule that differs by 40 hours or more a week between these two different use types, do I actually just end up with ALL system 3 even though the total net building area is above the 75,000 sq ft cutoff where we're supposed to go to System 5?

I'm confused!  Any help would be appreciated.

To recap:

16,000 sq ft office, heated/cooled to 72/75
30,000 sq ft of storage with basically no operating hours per week, heated/cooled to 50/120
36,000 sq ft of manufacturing / workshop area that is used approximately 50 hrs a week, heated/cooled to 50/120

Mixture of System 3 and System 5, or ALL system 3?

Karen,

Electric rates in ComEd territory are rather complicated because in many instances they only provide power distribution and the customer selects another power provider.

Hello,

Does anyone have ComEd and People's Gas rates available for a small commercial business in Chicago, IL?  I have tried their websites and customer service, but can't seem to get through to any useful information.  If any of you in the Chicago area can pass on the following info, it will be greatly appreciated:

Electric:

monthly fees

schedule of on-peak and off-peak hours

$/KW and $/kwh for both on and off-peak

taxes and additional fees


Gas:

I have a summary of charges, but the website lists various additional charges, with no associated rate (Environmental charge, Infrastructure Cost Recovery Charge, taxes, and other fees).  If anyone can provide information regarding these additional fees, I would appreciate it.

Thanks!

Karen

Hi everyone,

I wanted to thank you all for your input. I expect that we will have these tools/data on our website soon. If you want to know when they're posted, please email me.

Also feel free to email me other thoughts on which data is most useful to you (either comments or additions to what's already been sent around) and I'll see if I can't get that to you or up on our website for all to see.

Thanks again! I hope that the end result of this will be useful to the modeling industry.

Cheers,

Dear Alex,

The best way (currently) to supply information about your windows for use in energy simulation programs would be to generate DOE-2 and EnergyPlus report files from WINDOW program.  One caveat is that DOE-2 report file cannot be generated for the real window frames, but you can use average U-factor for your actual frames and create a generic frames that can be used in DOE-2 report.  That way you can circumvent this deficiency in DOE-2 functionality.  EnergyPlus report does not have this deficiency.  For other simulation programs, it is hard to say what they would need, but generally the following is important information about a window (all included in EnergyPlus report file):


-          Glazing

o   Center of glazing system conductance

o   Center of glazing U-factor

o   Convective and radiative portions of outdoor and indoor film coefficients

o   Number of glazing layers

o   Center of glazing SHGC as a function of angle of incidence, including hemispherical

o   Center of glazing T_sol as a function of angle of incidence, including hemispherical

o   Center of glazing Rf_sol as a function of angle of incidence, including hemispherical

o   Center of glazing Rb_sol as a function of angle of incidence, including hemispherical

o   Center of glazing T_vis as a function of angle of incidence, including hemispherical

o   Center of glazing Rf_vis as a function of angle of incidence, including hemispherical

o   Center of glazing Rb_vis as a function of angle of incidence, including hemispherical

o   Center of glazing Layer absorptances

o   Size of the transparent area (Width and Height)

-          Frame:

o   Projected framing depth for each cross-section

o   Outside projection

o   Conductance

o   Edge of glazing conductance

o   Surface absorptivity

o   Surface emissivity

It would be also helpful if detailed layer by layer properties of glazing is supplied (i.e., solar-optical spectral properties of individual layers of glazing, meaning solar-optical properties as a function of wavelength, each glazing layer thickness, conductivity and two surface emissivities), gap fill thermo-physical properties and gap widths.

Hi all,

My company is looking at making available some BIM models as well as compiling data on our windows to help energy modelers analyze our windows and glass into buildings.

The ones that seem most obvious to me are:

 *   COG U-factor
 *   Full Frame U-factor
 *   COG SHGC/SC (do people prefer one or are both useful?)
 *   Full Frame SHGC
 *   VT
 *   Thickness

I feel like some software requires more detailed inputs, so I've come up with the additional categories:

 *   Visible Transmittance by color
 *   Visible Reflectance Front and Back
 *   Solar Transmittance
 *   Solar  Reflectance Front and Back
 *   UV transmittance

Please feel free to add and comment on this list. Our purpose of providing this data is to make consultants' lives easier so let me know if you think of anything that would be helpful. Thanks for your input!

I can't find an addenda on this, but which publication is correct for
defining the baseline system of a non-residential building less than 3
stories?

 

The base 90.1-2004 document says that if the building is 3-stories or
less AND < 75,000 sq ft, System 3 and 4 are to be used.

The User's Manual, on the other hand, says "For smaller non-residential
buildings that are less than 75,000 ft2 (any height) OR less than three
stories (any area)"...the baseline system is PSZ (System 3 or 4)

 

Which is correct?

It sounds like the storage and workshop area may be semi-heated as

are semi-heated then they should be modeled only with heating in the
baseline case and the requirements of Table G3.1.10 don't apply.  It's

Subject: [Bldg-sim] thoughts on App G system type for mixed use building

 

I've got a 92,000 square foot Industrial building that I am modeling.
If you went by Table G3.1.1A, the baseline system type would be System 5
- Packaged VAV with reheat.

 

However, of the 92,000 square feet, approximately 16,000 sq ft is
conditioned to standard 75/72 degrees, while the remainder is a mixture
of storage, manufacturing, etc, and is heated to 55 and cooled to 120
(no actual cooling in proposed model, but you've got to insert some sort
of cooling system per App G).

 

So I really have 16,000 sq ft that is fully conditioned, and 76,000 sq
ft that is only partially conditioned (ie the peak thermal load differs
by 10 Btu/h-ft2).  

 

Any guesses how I configure this?

 

Do I have a packaged VAV system for the 76,000 sq ft of shop/storage and
isolate the 16,000 ft2 of real conditioned space as system 3 per the
Exception to G3.1.1?  

 

Or do I have a packaged VAV system for the 16,000 ft conditioned space
and isolate the 76,000 sq ft as system 3?

 

To further complicate things, since the 76,000 sq ft is split between
storage and manufacturing, where there is theoretically an operating
schedule that differs by 40 hours or more a week between these two
different use types, do I actually just end up with ALL system 3 even
though the total net building area is above the 75,000 sq ft cutoff
where we're supposed to go to System 5?

 

I'm confused!  Any help would be appreciated.

 

To recap:

 

16,000 sq ft office, heated/cooled to 72/75

30,000 sq ft of storage with basically no operating hours per week,
heated/cooled to 50/120

36,000 sq ft of manufacturing / workshop area that is used approximately
50 hrs a week, heated/cooled to 50/120

 

Mixture of System 3 and System 5, or ALL system 3?

I can't find an addenda on this, but which publication is correct for
defining the baseline system of a non-residential building less than 3
stories?

 

The base 90.1-2004 document says that if the building is 3-stories or less
AND < 75,000 sq ft, System 3 and 4 are to be used.

The User's Manual, on the other hand, says "For smaller non-residential
buildings that are less than 75,000 ft2 (any height) OR less than three
stories (any area)".the baseline system is PSZ (System 3 or 4)

 

Which is correct?

Hi James,

 

It sounds like the storage and workshop area may be semi-heated as defined
by Section 3.  I'd recommend looking into that.  If the spaces are
semi-heated then they should be modeled only with heating in the baseline
case and the requirements of Table G3.1.10 don't apply.  It's also worth
noting that if the spaces are semi-heated they should be modeled with
different envelope values in the baseline case (based on the semi-heated in
Table 5.5).

James,

It has been awhile since I have really looked at 90.1-2007, but your space type has no bearing on what the system type is going to be.  You just need to know whether your building type is res or not, this should be whole building.  Seeing that you reference 2004 and assuming your project is 2.2 (also you should be referencing the actual standard not the manual for finality), you should be using system 5 or 6 due to the square footage.  I got jammed up on the square footage vs. number of floors once myself.  I got reviewed on a job where the building was one floor and 80k sqft but I had used system 3.  When I changed to system 5 the savings doubled, I resubmitted and since the project was on the cusp of silver to gold, they got gold instead of the expected silver.  I am assuming everyone was just glad things worked out there.

Secondly, I don't think whether the space is conditioned or not matters either. G expects all spaces to be conditioned.  I say again, it has been awhile since I have thoroughly looked at this standard and I know a few people have quarks about the whole space conditioning expectations (just trying to get some good discussion going) seeing as how us HVAC/energy guys are so stuck on carbon-based realties.  But, in reality (and to answer your question), the entire charade is all up to interpretation anyways :)

To add my thoughts onto Kevin's

The whole building may need to be system 5, but they can be multiple system
5s.
	So one system type #5 for the office area, and a completely separate
system type #5 for the storage area and another for the manufacturing.  This
will make the return air for each system closer to the supply.  Using three
separate systems would also make your baseline more efficient making your
design improvement lower.

	I agree with your idea of modeling a cooling system but making the
set points extremely high and extremely low so they never turn on. I have
received this same advice on other projects.

either. G expects all spaces to be conditioned.  I say again, it has been
awhile since I have thoroughly looked at this standard and I know a few
people have quarks about the whole space conditioning expectations (just
trying to get some good discussion going) seeing as how us HVAC/energy guys
are so stuck on carbon-based realties.  But, in reality (and to answer your
question), the entire charade is all up to interpretation anyways :-)

I can't find an addenda on this, but which publication is correct for
defining the baseline system of a non-residential building less than 3
stories?

 

The base 90.1-2004 document says that if the building is 3-stories or less
AND < 75,000 sq ft, System 3 and 4 are to be used.

The User's Manual, on the other hand, says "For smaller non-residential
buildings that are less than 75,000 ft2 (any height) OR less than three
stories (any area)"...the baseline system is PSZ (System 3 or 4)

 

Which is correct?

Thanks Greg, but based on the heating density, I can't classify these as
semi-heated.

Hi James,

 

It sounds like the storage and workshop area may be semi-heated as defined by
Section 3.  I'd recommend looking into that.  If the spaces are semi-heated
then they should be modeled only with heating in the baseline case and the
requirements of Table G3.1.10 don't apply.  It's also worth noting that if
the spaces are semi-heated they should be modeled with different envelope
values in the baseline case (based on the semi-heated in Table 5.5).

Subject: [Bldg-sim] thoughts on App G system type for mixed use building

 

I've got a 92,000 square foot Industrial building that I am modeling.  If you
went by Table G3.1.1A, the baseline system type would be System 5 - Packaged
VAV with reheat.

 

However, of the 92,000 square feet, approximately 16,000 sq ft is conditioned
to standard 75/72 degrees, while the remainder is a mixture of storage,
manufacturing, etc, and is heated to 55 and cooled to 120 (no actual cooling
in proposed model, but you've got to insert some sort of cooling system per
App G).

 

So I really have 16,000 sq ft that is fully conditioned, and 76,000 sq ft
that is only partially conditioned (ie the peak thermal load differs by 10
Btu/h-ft2).  

 

Any guesses how I configure this?

 

Do I have a packaged VAV system for the 76,000 sq ft of shop/storage and
isolate the 16,000 ft2 of real conditioned space as system 3 per the
Exception to G3.1.1?  

 

Or do I have a packaged VAV system for the 16,000 ft conditioned space and
isolate the 76,000 sq ft as system 3?

 

To further complicate things, since the 76,000 sq ft is split between storage
and manufacturing, where there is theoretically an operating schedule that
differs by 40 hours or more a week between these two different use types, do
I actually just end up with ALL system 3 even though the total net building
area is above the 75,000 sq ft cutoff where we're supposed to go to System 5?

 

I'm confused!  Any help would be appreciated.

 

To recap:

 

16,000 sq ft office, heated/cooled to 72/75

30,000 sq ft of storage with basically no operating hours per week,
heated/cooled to 50/120

36,000 sq ft of manufacturing / workshop area that is used approximately 50
hrs a week, heated/cooled to 50/120

 

Mixture of System 3 and System 5, or ALL system 3?

Is it correct that the EER and COP efficiencies listed in Tables 6.8.1?for packaged equipments includes fan energy thus I still have to?separate fan power? Or are these effiency already exclude fan energy?

So for a 2.85 COP,?375 cfm, 12000 Btu/h?unit and using the fan power in Appendix G I would end up with ?baseline bhp of 0.323 and Pfan of .319 and COP of 4.19.? Can anyone confirm this? I think the COP I am geting is too high for a baseline?

Thanks.

If the windows are existing to remain, then you are correct that they would
be the same in the proposed and baseline. If you change out windows then the
baseline would be min performance per ASHRAE.

I think your assumption about not changing the windows by orientation is
correct.  I am not sure you even need to do four orientations if the
building is existing.

I may be misreading one of your emails, but if you are doing a building
renovation to an existing building, even if you ARE changing out
windows, the baseline model retains the envelope characteristics of the
existing building.  You don't have to bring the baseline windows up to
90.1 standards unless it is a portion of the building that is being
added under the proposed work.

 

Also, check the archives - I thought that some GBCI reviews of projects
have required the four orientations even for existing buildings.

include the SHGC on the windows and any fixed shading devices on the

I assume this would further mean that when we are doing the baseline

Although according to Appendix G I believe this should be the way (since

they have only printed that remark for the building envelope involving

James is correct regarding the windows - they should be modeled using the pre-renovation U-value and SHGC in the baseline case.

The baseline case should not be rotated for existing buildings, nor should it be rotated if the construction is an addition.  The basis of the rotation requirement for new construction is to reward the project team for choosing the most efficient orientation for a building and this is not an option for existing buildings and additions.

I may be misreading one of your emails, but if you are doing a building renovation to an existing building, even if you ARE changing out windows, the baseline model retains the envelope characteristics of the existing building.  You don't have to bring the baseline windows up to 90.1 standards unless it is a portion of the building that is being added under the proposed work.

Also, check the archives - I thought that some GBCI reviews of projects have required the four orientations even for existing buildings.

If the windows are existing to remain, then you are correct that they would be the same in the proposed and baseline. If you change out windows then the baseline would be min performance per ASHRAE.

I think your assumption about not changing the windows by orientation is correct.  I am not sure you even need to do four orientations if the building is existing.

Dear All,

Just want to have your opinions about this: Since the building we are
applying for LEED certification is an existing building (and there are no
additions), the building envelope in our baseline model is identical to
the existing conditions in real life. We have interpreted this to also
include the SHGC on the windows and any fixed shading devices on the
windows, so these we have also modeled as existing in real life.

I assume this would further mean that when we are doing the baseline
simulation in four rotations, we do not need to change anything with the
SHGC's on the windows in each rotation.

Although according to Appendix G I believe this should be the way (since
the remark involving existing buildings is printed as the last entry in
the table), I still have some doubts as in the LEED NC reference guide
they have only printed that remark for the building envelope involving
opaque surfaces, and the criteria involving windows seems to be
independent of this (on p.270).

Thanks for any replies,

Joerg:

If you don't mind a non-Metric answer, eQuest should fill your needs nicely. It has reciprocating and gas turbine capabilities, with both jacket and exhaust heat available in the engine case. The only thing I am unsure of is taking the exhaust gas from one prime mover and injecting it into another.

It also has quite substantial central plant capabilities as well.

Hello Listserv members,

I just received a question from GBCI on a LEED CI project related to lighting power density. It was my understanding that per ASHRAE 90.1-2004 std. plugged in task lights are exempted from the overall lighting power density calculations. However, our review came back saying that task lights should be included in the overall calculations. Is this true? Has the standard changed recently?

 Any input is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

The appropriate section happens to be right in front of me - assuming
you have task lights defined in the construction documents (plans/specs)
being reviewed, it looks to me that your USGBC reviewer is correct, but
not telling you the whole story...

 

90.1-2004, Appendix G, Table G3.1, Section 6. "Lighting" (d):

 

"Lighting system power shall include all lighting system components
shown or provided for on the plans (including lamps and ballasts and
task and furniture-mounted fixtures)."

 

The following exception for multifamily dwellings and hotel/motel guest
rooms makes a distinction regarding cord + receptacle task lights:

 

"Exception: For... spaces in which lighting systems are connected via
receptacles and are not shown or provided for on building plans, assume
identical lighting power for the proposed and baseline building designs
in the simulations, but exclude these loads when calculating the
baseline building performance and proposed building performance."

 

Falling back to the glossary definition for performance (cost), that
means if you are modeling the task lights, add their wattage identically
to the baseline and proposed model LPD's to model the internal load
contributions, but then subtract the cost of the energy to operate those
fixtures from the final costs you arrive at.

 

In summary, you should model the task lights as internal loads, but not
the cost of operating them.  That's my take anyway =),

*** Please excuse the cross-posting ***

In response to the Requests for Proposals for development of an HVAC and a lighting energy modeling course that were announced on these mailing lists, IBPSA-USA received two questions. Please find below the questions and the response from IBPSA-USA. 

Further information regarding the Requests for Proposals can be found at http://www.ibpsa.us/

Best regards,

Michael Wetter
IBPSA-USA Vice President 

===================================================
Question: Can you clarify how to interpret the reference to a tool to be available at no cost or low cost?
In the section titled: General Approach of the Workshop, the RFP states:
"The workshop is to demonstrate how to develop and apply building energy models to several examples of new and existing building situations (e.g., office, retail, hotel, warehouse) using one or more energy simulation tools that meet the modeling tool requirements of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2007 Appendix G and are available to general users at no cost or low cost."
 
Answer: The reference to energy simulation tools available to general users at no cost or low cost refers to the example case studies to be used in the workshop.  The material covered in the workshop should be general enough to be of benefit to users of any energy simulation tool and not one specific tool.  The majority of case study I/O example files delivered to IBPSA-USA as part of the training material should come from tools available at low or no-cost. However, the inclusion of examples from multiple tools is encouraged. Examples from higher cost tools are not prohibited.
 
Question: For the Intellectual Property Rights do you have any idea on the royalty fee charged might be?
In the section titled: Intellectual Property Rights, the RFP states:
"IBPSA-USA will reserve the right to charge a royalty fee to individuals or organizations that use the product of this work as part of income-producing documents, live workshops, or online workshops."
 
Answer: IBPSA-USA intends for this information to be disseminated as widely as possible to aid the building simulation community, but also wishes to recuperate the expenses of developing the course materials with reasonable royalty fees from organizations that use the material in an income-producing manner. Having not done this before, IBPSA-USA does not yet know what these royalty terms may be.  In the past, for courses offered at SimBuild conferences, IBPSA-USA has charged a fee of 10% of the course fee as a payment. It expects to follow a similar model with the workshop material to be developed from the proposed work, but royalties will be decided on a case by case basis.  If the bidder has a definite royalty requirement for using the material in an income-producing manner, these should be included in their proposal.

There?s a subtle but important distinction I think we?re making here within 90.1-2004:

 

9.1.3 and the glossary in combination define ?installed interior lighting power.?  Reading both appropriate passages, you can conclude this only includes ?permanently installed? fixtures.  I think we can all agree cord and plug receptacles are in general not supposed to be included in any normal LPD (W/SF) calculation (for compliance documentation or otherwise).

 

Priya and the USGBC reviewer we?re discussing however are bringing up a separate issue, which is the passage in Appendix G that specifically tells us to handle cord and plug task lighting in a different manner.  This is specifically in the context of baseline/proposed energy models, and would not apply to any LPD sums made for purposes outside of energy modeling against a 90.1 baseline.  I?ve copied my response below for reference.

?Exception: For? spaces in which lighting systems are connected via receptacles and are not shown or provided for on building plans, assume identical lighting power for the proposed and baseline building designs in the simulations, but exclude these loads when calculating the baseline building performance and proposed building performance.?

 

Falling back to the glossary definition for performance (cost), that means if you are modeling the task lights, add their wattage identically to the baseline and proposed model LPD?s to model the internal load contributions, but then subtract the cost of the energy to operate those fixtures from the final costs you arrive at.

 

In summary, you should model the task lights as internal loads, but not the cost of operating them.  That?s my take anyway =),

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1-2004 and task lights

 

Hello Listserv members,

 

I just received a question from GBCI on a LEED CI project related to lighting power density. It was my understanding that per ASHRAE 90.1-2004 std. plugged in task lights are exempted from the overall lighting power density calculations. However, our review came back saying that task lights should be included in the overall calculations. Is this true? Has the standard changed recently?

 

 Any input is greatly appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Priya

Yes, what you stated below was also my understanding until the question was asked. If you looking at lighting power from an energy modeling standpoint, yes, all lighting  must be included and task lighting is treated as plug load and accounted for accordingly. However, in my project?s case, as we are talking exclusively about lighting alone and anything that qualifies as a plug load need not be included. I need to find the copy of the ASHRAE std that I could attach as reference.

Thanks for your input and clarification. Appreciate it.

There?s a subtle but important distinction I think we?re making here within 90.1-2004:

9.1.3 and the glossary in combination define ?installed interior lighting power.?  Reading both appropriate passages, you can conclude this only includes ?permanently installed? fixtures.  I think we can all agree cord and plug receptacles are in general not supposed to be included in any normal LPD (W/SF) calculation (for compliance documentation or otherwise).

Priya and the USGBC reviewer we?re discussing however are bringing up a separate issue, which is the passage in Appendix G that specifically tells us to handle cord and plug task lighting in a different manner.  This is specifically in the context of baseline/proposed energy models, and would not apply to any LPD sums made for purposes outside of energy modeling against a 90.1 baseline.  I?ve copied my response below for reference.

The appropriate section happens to be right in front of me ? assuming you have task lights defined in the construction documents (plans/specs) being reviewed, it looks to me that your USGBC reviewer is correct, but not telling you the whole story?

90.1-2004, Appendix G, Table G3.1, Section 6. ?Lighting? (d):

?Lighting system power shall include all lighting system components shown or provided for on the plans (including lamps and ballasts and task and furniture-mounted fixtures).?

Hi Priya, 

 

I have been involved in a number of CI projects and I have the same
understanding - only permanently installed task lighting needs to be
included.

Can you provide the reviewers comments?  Maybe I or someone else can see
what they're getting at.

Which of those systems mentioned in the ASHRAE 90.1 can we use to compare such equipment?

Well, there seems to be no ARI standard for testing VRV yet. So, you won't
find it in 90.1.
The closest you can get is packaged single zone (match cooling capacity) i
believe but you'll have to figure out a way of modelling the fresh air side-
as DOAS or others.

Hi all!

 

Is it possible to make an WBS according to appendix G for a parking garage?
What assumptions do I have to make?

 

Or in other words: Is it possible to get a LEED certification for a parking
garage? (no toilets, no mechanical ventilation, just lighting). Which rating
system? Just found this on:
http://www.inhabitat.com/2008/04/14/first-leed-certified-parking-garage/ 

 

Kind regards

Jeorg,

I would guess that your most likely solution would be the following:

1. find out how many buildings are similiar enough so that you can reduce your number of modeled buildings and just use multipliers.
2. model those representative buildings.
3. output their hot water use from the district plant.
4. sum their hourly profiles up (remember to apply multipliers) using excel or some other spreadsheet calculation method.
5. Make your Cogeneration plant in the last model and attach an hourly process load to the hot water loop that is representative of the summed up hourly load profiles.

This may be a little time intensive/computing power intensive to simulate and sum up all these results so try to use multipliers as much as you can with similiar buildings.  Good luck!

Joerg:

If you don't mind a non-Metric answer, eQuest should fill your needs nicely. It has reciprocating and gas turbine capabilities, with both jacket and exhaust heat available in the engine case. The only thing I am unsure of is taking the exhaust gas from one prime mover and injecting it into another.

It also has quite substantial central plant capabilities as well.

Here's another opinion (non-authoritative): I believe the VRV efficiency requirements would match best with the "air cooled, cooling and heating modes" requirements in Table 6.8.1B (for heat pumps).  In the ECB method, this would most likely be system 8, Packaged terminal heat pumps.  I agree that the ventilation should be modeled separately as a DOAS.

I agree with Larry. There is no exact system specified in the ASHRAE 90.1 that
matches the VRV system. We used to model the VRV system using the efficiencies
in Table 6.8.1B, however note that these efficiencies are typically for full
load operations, hence it will not capture the advantage of the part load
capability of the VRV systems. I.e. to say, the savings calculated as such
will be typically conservative.

 

Also note that VRV systems are generally waived from the DOE test procedure
applicable to commercial package air-cooled central air conditioners and heat
pumps (2 systems that I know of are the Mitsubishi City-Multi and Sanyo
VRV-III systems) although they have to comply with the alternate testing
procedure. So just take note of the system efficiencies used for the modeling.

Here's another opinion (non-authoritative): I believe the VRV efficiency
requirements would match best with the "air cooled, cooling and heating modes"
requirements in Table 6.8.1B (for heat pumps).  In the ECB method, this would
most likely be system 8, Packaged terminal heat pumps.  I agree that the
ventilation should be modeled separately as a DOAS.

Gavin is correct that modeling VRV systems as heat pumps will not
demonstrate efficiencies related to part load operation.  Additionally,
efficiencies related to heat reclaim during periods of the year when
applicable will not be captured in the model.  Energy Pro, by
Energysoft, is the only software I am aware of that has the appropriate
algorithms programmed to provide accurate simulations.  Energy Pro is a
front end software package for DOE-2 simulation.  We have used it on
several occasions to demonstrate anticipated energy savings.

I have an interesting problem and wonder if it can be solved theoretically.
It is just a simple hot water heating coil with constant water flow rate and
constant air flow with constant incoming temp. and humidity.  If current
conditions are given, is there a way to calculate the temperature drop in the
delivered air based on lowering the temperature of the incoming hot water?
 
Thanks,
Matt

I have been involved in a couple of projects where the overhead lighting has
been designed to have a low ambient light level, with task lighting provided
for the work spaces.  This is because most people in the offices will be
working at computers, and not need high levels of lighting.

For one or two projects, I included task lighting in the proposed case, but
not in the base case.  I received comments from the LEED reviewer that all
process lighting (including task lights) must be the same between the
proposed and the baseline.  This is regardless of the fact that the presence
of task lights allowed us to reduce the installed lighting power.

Ever since, I've been including task lights equally in the proposed and
baseline cases, and had no comments on this approach.

I understand that ventilation is modeled separately as DOAS, or dummy
outdoor air system for certain hybrid strategies, but would anyone have a
good idea of why dummy zones are modeled, from a building physics
perspective? Thank you.

Hi,

If I right understood, besides the characteristics of the flows, you have to
know the efficiency of the fan coil. Then,

air_fow*T_dif_air*cp_air=efficiency*water_flow*T_dif_water*cp_water <=>

T_dif_air=efficiency*(water_flow*T_dif_water*cp_water)/(air_flow*cp_air)

Regards.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] 90.1-2007, Table 6.5.3.1.1A, Option 2
Message-ID: <AE3526189BB78143B795EF9C45CB8CBB02376CFF@gbsbs.GB-Eng.local>

All,

 

A colleague brought up an interesting point about filters and fan BHp. 

 

Regarding 90.1-2007, Table 6.5.3.1.1A, Option 2, what is your
interpretation of "bhp = the maximum combined fan brake horsepower" for
an AHU?  And how does 90.1-2007 verify this?

 

90.1-2007 defines "fan system bhp" and "fan system design conditions";
however there isn't any clear mention of how exactly fan BHp is defined
with respect to filters (100% loaded filter delta-p, 66% loaded filter
delta-p, 33% loaded filter delta-p, etc.).  The fan system would still
meet capacity requirements, just at a reduced filter pressure drop as
scheduled.

 

For example, a designer could define (and schedule) the fan BHp to
operate at a max of 66% of allowable filter pressure drop for reduced
fan energy, yet schedule a fan motor to be able to meet the fully loaded
filter pressure drop.  

 

The ramifications of scheduling a lower fan BHp against 90.1-2007 is the
proposed system will now be operating more "efficiently", compared to
the baseline, assuming the filters are truly replaced at 66% of
allowable filter pressure drop (which likely would never happen in the
field!).  

 

Any thoughts on this?  Anyone on the 90.1-2007 committee that could shed
some insight?

 

Thanks,

Ryan

Has anyone used Energy Pro to model variable refrigerant flow systems?

 

The software looks like it is pretty product specific and I am wondering
if it can be used to model the entire building for LEED EAc1 purposes or
if it can only model the VRF system.  Any input would be appreciated.

Message-ID: <e70580c61003161344wda7ff92r33ed167de9948190@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,
              I am modelling a heat pipe in the parametric runs (*my system
has a Make-up air unit and I am adding a heat pipe to it*). The Inputs
eQUEST asks for the following:

(1) *Sensible Effectiveness*: I inputting a value of 0.48.


(2) *Frac. Sensible HX Resistance from Air Films*: The heat pipe
manufacturer does not any thing about this coefficient neither they list in
the catalog. I tried varying the resistance values from 0 to 1 in incerments
of 0.1 - Once I simulate the parametric runs, there are zero savings from
this measure

(3) *Exponent Varying Sensible Air films Resistance*: I varied the values
from 0 to 1 in terms of 0.1. My understanding is that the flows in the Make
up unit are turbulent and hence there has to some number to this exponent.

After I varied these values, and I simulate the parametric runs, there are
zero savings from this measure. The reason I varied these values was that
there were zero savings even for the single value input. I am looking for
little guidance. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Gaiko,

 

Good afternoon.  We have used Energy Pro to model VRV systems. The
software is product specific because the operating algorithm for each
make/model of heat pump listed in the software menu is programmed into
the software.

You can certainly model a building using the software and provided your
baseline comparative building meets 90.1 requirements you can conduct a
comparison.

 

Hope this helps.

Tim

Message-ID: <20100317113016.AAC824800D@diego.dreamhost.com>

Dear friends, 

I am working on two projects of core and shell where the baseline system is
system 8 i.e VAV with fan powered boxes.

There are two different building which are very similar in nature (not same)
and situated at same location.

However there are differences in the way the two models are behaving.

I have shown the breakdown of different end uses as a percentage of overall
baseline energy consumption

 

Project 1

Plug loads:        25.5 % 

Interior Lighting: 16%

Cooling energy:  28.7%

Fan energy:       21%

Pumps:             6.3 %

Space heating:  0.1%

Domestic hot water + Exterior Lighting: 1.3 %

 

Project 2

Plug loads:        24 % 

Interior lighting:  15%

Cooling energy:  18%

Fan energy:       25%

Pumps:             15 %

Space heating:  0.3%

Domestic hot water + Exterior Lighting: 1.3%

 

 

It can be seen that the energy consumed due to plug loads and interior
lighting as a percentage of baseline are all most equal in both the cases.

Can anyone suggest possible explanation or give hints as to why the pumping
energy as a percentage of baseline has more than doubled in the

 second case given that the characteristics of chiller, condenser and pump
remain same ,given it is the baseline case. 

One difference is that the first project uses two chillers as it has
conditioned area more than 1, 20,000 sq ft while the second project has only

 one chiller ,its conditioned area being less than 1, 20,000

Vishnu:

I am guessing you let eQuest size the pumps. I will also bet you have the pumps set on STANDBY vs. DEMAND, Therefore, CHW pumps run all the time for the two chiller scenario, regardless if two chillers are needed.

See if that helps.

Hello All,

Does anyone know of a way I can reference a child code word for DOE2?  My specific situation is that I want my infiltration to be controlled via a global parameter that represents the infiltration in terms of CFM/SF of Exterior wall.  I want to be able to parametrically change this value so I have to do it in DD Edit.  The problem is that infiltration is a zone keyword that is the parent of the exterior wall.  It wouldn't be an issue the other way around because I could just use the #P("keyword").  Any ideas on how I can reference the child using DOE2 language?

Even having an idea on how I can define all of the exterior wall's length per zone would be helpful.

Your pumps are probably constant volume on the condenser (cooling tower)
loop. Doubling your chillers will double the amount of power required for
pushing the same volume of water to both chillers.

John,

It is like buying a car.  Do you want a truck, manual/automatic, something
fast.......  You are asking for information overload.  If you know exactly
what you want it may be easier for us (in this list) to help guide you to the
best option.

I also was once curious and found the link below.  The end of the paper has
charts comparing different features.
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/pdfs/contrasting_the_c
apabilities_of_building_energy_performance_simulation_programs_v1.0.pdf 

Another sight.
http://www.wbdg.org/resources/energyanalysis.php


I use Trace 700 (v6.2.4).  Why? Because the first, second and third company I
worked for used it.  It is good for running loads, but so-so for energy
modeling.  Also I have never used anything else.  I have looked at equest and
DOE, they both look like learning a completely new programming language.  

I wouldn't mind hearing other people's brief views of the programs they use.
Equest, DOE, HAP, ect.

Vishnuraj,


If I get your question correct, then you are wondering why is your project 1 with 2 chillers showing less pump energy than Project 2 which has 1 chiller, the other parameters being the same with a slight difference in areas of both the project. Is this correct? 

If I got your question correct, which I think I do, as I was able to duplicate the same behavior in a test project. I changed only the number of chillers and simulated in two locations.....( I know you might think I have got a lot of time on my hand..... but believe it or not this is a break from EnergyPro....anyway....) 

Here are the results:

Project with 2 chillers: Less Pump Energy

Project with 1 chiller: More Pump Energy

However, I can offer only a partial answer. May be somebody reading this may have the complete answer.

The answer to your question is in the CW loop pump. The project with 2 chillers, shows that the CW loop pump runs in lower part load ranges than the project with 1 chiller (see the PS-H Report). A Pump sized for peak load conditions would use less energy when running at part load. Therefore, the project with 2 chillers uses less pump energy than the project with 1 chiller. 

Hope this helps.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Equest:Variation in pumping energy for Baseline system 8


Dear friends, 

I am working on two projects of core and shell where the baseline system is system 8 i.e VAV with fan powered boxes.

There are two different building which are very similar in nature (not same) and situated at same location.

However there are differences in the way the two models are behaving.

I have shown the breakdown of different end uses as a percentage of overall baseline energy consumption

 

Project 1

Plug loads:        25.5 % 

Interior Lighting: 16%

Cooling energy:  28.7%

Fan energy:       21%

Pumps:             6.3 %

Space heating:  0.1%

Domestic hot water + Exterior Lighting: 1.3 %

 

Project 2

Plug loads:        24 % 

Interior lighting:  15%

Cooling energy:  18%

Fan energy:       25%

Pumps:             15 %

Space heating:  0.3%

Domestic hot water + Exterior Lighting: 1.3%

 

 

It can be seen that the energy consumed due to plug loads and interior lighting as a percentage of baseline are all most equal in both the cases.

Can anyone suggest possible explanation or give hints as to why the pumping energy as a percentage of baseline has more than doubled in the

 second case given that the characteristics of chiller, condenser and pump remain same ,given it is the baseline case. 

One difference is that the first project uses two chillers as it has conditioned area more than 1, 20,000 sq ft while the second project has only

 one chiller ,its conditioned area being less than 1, 20,000

A couple of thoughts -

- in eQUEST, when a heat recovery device is added, a new report, "ERV" 
is added to the .sim file.  This shows monthly peak and total heat 
recovery along with the added energy for fans.

- static pressure added on the 2nd heat recovery tab does not show on 
the SV-A report but does show on the ERV report and is included in fan 
energy on the BEPS.  It could be that your heat recovery is being masked 
by your added fan energy

- the default control for ERV's is "float" which maximizes the heat 
recovery at all times (which is what will happen if there is no control 
on the ERV and is probably true of a heat pipe unless you are bypassing 
the OA during free cooling.  It could be lost free cooling is masking 
heat recovery.

- with regard to the fields you are running as parametric runs -- right 
click the field to get help on the inputs.

- finally -- how are you creating the make-up air unit?  If you are 
using the OA-FROM keyword, there are issues with how that is currently 
modelled which will prevent heat recovery from seeing the exhaust flow 
and exhaust temperature you are expecting.

Hope this helps.  Note that there is also an eQUEST specific list at 
onebuilding.org.

I am modeling an existing building that is pursuing LEED NC. Windows and
roof have recently been improved. Obviously the modeled energy
improvement for EAc1 will be greater if the baseline can be modeled with
the old windows and roof insulation.
 
Has anybody worked on LEED projects where they justified using
"existing" windows and/or roof insulation values for the baseline model
that had actually been replaced months ago (or 1 year ago? two years
ago?)?

Dear All,

 

I am new to Leed compliance simulations and I would like to know how to
model external shading devices in the proposed and baseline building.
Appendix G, Table G3.1 ? 5. Building Envelope, is clear about permanent
shading devices being allowed for the proposed building. But what about the
baseline building? Do you model the external shading devices in the baseline
building as well?

 

I?d appreciate any help on the matter.

Appendix G allows you to claim credit for shading designs/devices.
Therefore, the baseline building is not required to have shading

Message-ID: <46C673B53EB10B4FBB704537018E8501018B0FFF@PGCMAIL01.platcorp.local>

Hello, 

 

I have a query for selecting baseline system from table G3.1.A Baseline
HVAC types 

For eg. System type, Non residential and 4 or 5 floors and <25,00sq.ft
or 5 floors or less and 25,000sq.ft to 150,000sq.ft

My project is an G+3 office building & parking building of 200,000
sq.ft.  The conditioned area is only 32,000 sq.ft.

So, which system do I need to assign in the baseline?

When it say non residential 4 or 5 floor, does it include the ground
floor too?

Message-ID: <003701cac9bc$9b204b60$d160e220$@guhl@energyarq.com>

Dear All,

 

I am modeling an industrial building for Leed compliance and I have some
doubts about how to model the proposed and baseline building:

 

The ventilation rates defined by the user for most of the zones are much
higher than the required rates. The point is that we just can?t reach the
necessary savings due to the high ventilation rates and therefore we
recommended to reduce them.  Now my question is how to model this for Leed
compliance. Is it necessary to model both the baseline and proposed building
with the same ventilation rates? Or do I need to model the baseline building
with the required rates according to Ashrae 90.1 and the proposed building
with the defined rates? Suggestions are highly appreciated. 

 

Regards,

Lizzy

Hi Lizzy, here is a great answer from David on a similar topic that was posted to the list last November.  Be sure to search the archives, you might find the rest of the conversation helpful also.

Quick answer:

90.1 does not care if you are pursuing EQC2, use the same OA quantities in baseline and proposed for EAC1.


Long answer:

These are separate credits - the modeling takes place based on the proposed design in comparison to a baseline that is only restricted by 90.1.  The OA requirement should be the same in both models subject to any DCV or exceptional calcs or technologies.  This is not affected by other LEED credits.

The credit for increased ventilation takes place "before" modeling starts.  This is besides the many cases for laboratories or hospitals where the local code ventilation requirements are much greater than ASHRAE 62.1 already - the proposed design is in effect already taking the EAC1 penalty but earning the credit for increased ventilation under the best practice design.  You wouldn't relax the baseline ventilation to less than 30% in these cases!

I'm sure there are some proposed buildings out there that condition OA very effectively, and may gain EAC1 gross energy cost savings by having increased ventilation, but even where that effect occurs there is  the question of percentage savings applying to a larger energy consumption and cost.

Overall if you gain EAC1 points by pursuing increased ventilation, I think you have worked well within the system - good for you in designing a system to condition outside air so effectively.  For many projects (other than labs or hospitals which may have to use that quantity of OA anyway) I would expect EQC2 could be trading for an EAC1 credit, so you'll have to prioritize.  Both are rewarded from USGBC, but EAC1 is also rewarded in lower utility bills.

I think I can clarify the discussion.

 

First, baseline shading projections are NOT an option in 90.1-2007.  

 

TG3.1, Baseline Building Performance, Section c.  :  "...All vertical glazing shall be assumed to be flush with the exterior wall, and no shading projections shall be modeled..."

 

To answer Hisham, the reason you might want to (even though you're not allowed to), is that in some instances permanent fenestration shades can be detrimental to your annual energy performance.  Such shades almost always simultaneously help and hurt your HVAC systems - as they block solar load contributions in the summer (when you don't want them), but also in the winter (when you do).  Glare issues aside, identical permanent shades/fins can easily be thermally helpful on one orientation but not another for the same project.

Hi,

The baseline has to be modeled as per G3.1.5 which does not require shading devices to be modeled. Why would you want to model them in the baseline ?? This will only compromise your energy savings.

Hi,

Appendix G allows you to claim credit for shading designs/devices. Therefore, the baseline building is not required to have shading devices/projections.

Thank you Nick. You are completely right. I was asking this because the
solar load is needed in winter, especially in this case, because the heat
demand which is much bigger than the cold demand of the building. The fact
that I have to simulate the proposed building with external shading devices,
but the baseline building not, is giving me problems. Therefore my question.
Thanks again for the answers. Now I have it clear!

Message-ID: <b791531d1003220835hc083345t1597645c1ed33756@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Is it possible to simulate the multi-stage heating/cooling of HVAC system? I
tried a simple experiment in a cold winter day to compare two cases: 1)
always on with a fixed setpoint; 2) the same as 1, but the HVAC is off for
one minute and then restarts.The results show that case 2 consumes less
energy than case 1. However, with multi-stage efficiencies, case 2 should
comes more energy than case 1 due to the use of emergency heat.

I'd appreciate it very much if you could shed some light on this issue.
Thank you.

Best,
Jiakang

Subject: [Bldg-sim] Proposed Energy Modeling Conference - Your Input
	Requested
Message-ID: <1ad737951003221954t502edf13n56693fbe9ac1bd4a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Lynn,

I just came across someone's reference to your email request about a
Proposed Energy Modeling Conference .  As an independent consultant offering
whole building sim services to design clients, I would like to share my
input with you. I have also copied this to the eQuest-onebuilding.org users
list because I don't believe your initial email came through that
sim-communication avenue.

I am soo happy to hear that there is an initiative happening for this type
of venture.  It is much needed and I anticipate that after word gets out--it
will be well attended by the consultants who are really interested in
investing time & learning in the simulation services niche of the industry.
I especially would like to encourage the emphasis for discussion of service
fees & a baseline for acceptable services.  Let's face it--in this industry
niche, you truely do get what you pay for...  This is something that really
needs to be suggested to the many firms and independent consultants who are
trying to offer these services and really don't have the full picture of
what all is involved in what we do...

As an independent consultant I vote that the attendance fees for this
conference be kept as low as possible.  I do not carry a current membership
with ASHRAE only because I do not work for a firm that will pay for those
types of ancillary expenses--and honestly I'm too cheap to pay for my annual
membership out of my personal project income.  However, I will definitely
start planning & saving money so that I can attend this conference.

I am looking forward to taking the new BEMP exam and am very happy that
there is an initiative from some organization to help normalize a base
criteria for quality energy simulators and quality whole building simulation
service providers.  This should be a significant topic of education &
discussion at the conference in order to give the industry some baselines to
establish thier own services & fees.

As an ASHRAE committee there should be some discussion about the development
of simulation programs or the history of development.  Obviously the first
choice for software in the North American markets currently is
eQuest/DOE2.2--I am only in business for myself because of this software
being freeware.  (Again my 'cheap-ness' displays itself.)  But then again
this type of design tool should be freeware--for everyone to have access
to.  This is the only true way to fix our built environments and
subsequently our planetary environment.  Continued support & development
initiatives for freeware software for these purposes are imperative for our
industry to move forward at the pace that designers are developing new &
more complex strategies to fix our energy use issues.

Furthermore, I would hope that a conference of this nature would work to
nurture a community environment for us simulators.  So many of us know each
other via the email-threads & recognize names from others who have had
similar experiences or who have helped us directly.  This industry is a
lonely one, especially if you are the only energy simulator in your
office--without being able to have the support of other energy simulators we
can feel very alone in this new design frontier that is still in it's
infancy.  I love working on my own but my business would have a short chance
at success without the virtual community from the other simulators and I
(and so many others) turn to for support, clarification, mentorship and
training.

I have been doing whole building energy simulations since 1999 and have been
using eQuest (program of choice for me) since 2004.  My start on this career
path was on a team at a M&E design firm who focused on sustainable design
and using whole building simulation for all design aspects from SD-CD phases
& post occupancy evals.  I am in full support of ASHRAE's or anyones
initiative to offer a simulation-focused conference for the everyday users &
service providers.  Yes I am aware of IBPSA and such, but my experience with
these conferences are that more of the discussions are based on the
development of these programs and capabilities of these programs to reflect
the design/construction reality of the building designs.  So to have a
simulation conference for the everyday professionals that are just using the
programs in the capacity that they are available to offer the design
community answers they are being told they need to find (i.e. LEED &
Incentive program compliance purposes.)    I have much respect for the
developers of these programs because they are pressured to develop the
program capabilities as quickly as designers are developing new HVAC system
approaches--I am in full support of a development fund that would contribute
to the continued development of these types of programs at a pace that can
support the design community's needs for complex HVAC system configurations
& equipment (i.e. chilled slabs, etc.)

I have attached my professional CV for your reference of my experience and
interest with whole building simulation.  I welcome your contact if there is
anyway that I can assist with the planning of the conference or simply
promoting the effort for it.  Bottomline though, please plan it in a
location that is easily accessible & cost effective so that I can be sure to
attend (from a financial perspective.)

I look forward to hearing more about your plans for this conference and will
keep my eyes/ears posted to these user lists.

Lynn's email read:

ASHRAE is in the early planning stages of an Energy Modeling Conference for
the spring of 2011 that is targeted for consulting engineering
practitioners.  We are looking for input on the appropriate topics and/or
session types you would like to see at such a conference. Some topic
thoughts are: energy simulation, BIM, CFD and daylight modeling.

What conference content would prompt you to travel and attend such a
conference? Please be as specific as possible in describing what you would
like covered at the conference. What do you want to learn? What location(s)
in the US would draw the largest attendance, in your opinion?

Hi all,

I'm trying to serve one single zone with multiple HVAC systems, but it
doesn't seem to work with HVACTemplate. I wasn't able to find a good example
code online. I'm new to EnergyPlus. Could you please give me some hints? I
really appreciate your help.

Thank you.

Best,
Jiakang

Message-ID: <EADD21123407AE4C8C9F8CA7F3273BCE9D2F0112D6@mse21be1.mse21.exchange.ms>

I'd like to estimate the rate of heat transfer between an underground water storage tank and the surrounding earth.  Basically, water would be pumped out of the tank through a coil and returned to the tank.  The system would function like a groundwater source heat pump with two big differences:

1.  the system will use a tank instead of vertical wells so there will be much less transfer area/volume of water
2.  the tank is enclosed, water will not be drawn from the water table

Does anyone know of a study or software that would estimate the rate of heat transfer between the tank's walls and the surrounding earth?

Thanks,
Jon

Jon,
  We've done a good bit of simulation work along those lines using 
TRNSYS. I'm not aware of any dedicated simplified tools for that purpose.

All,

The original document (Simulation Tool Comparison.doc) had dated information regarding TRACE 700.  We have updated the document to reflect current and accurate information and added a few capabilities that have been added to TRACE within the past several years.  With the additional capabilities added, the document should be updated to reflect the current capabilities of DOE 2.2, eQUEST, and HAP.

<I?d like to estimate the rate of heat transfer between

Does anyone know of a study or software that would estimate
the rate of heat transfer between the tank?s walls and the surrounding
earth?>

We've done a few studies similar to your project and have used TRNSYS
quite successfully.  There are models available in TRNSYS to study buried
storage tanks (rectangular and cylindrical) as well as models for coils,
heat pumps, buried pipes etc.  The buried tank models use a 3-D finite
difference conduction approach for the surrounding soil and allow for tank
stratification, varying levels of insulation, immersed heat exchangers and
a slew of other tank-specific features.  The buried tank model also comes
with a viewing package that let's the user see the temperature
distribution around the buried tank.

I was at an Equest seminar the other day.  Equest does not have direct 
chilled beam modeling capability right now.  Those algorithms are due to be out in an update issued later this year(?).
Up till now, a work around has been used.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] 90.1-2007, Fan BHp and Filter Pressure Drop
Message-ID: <AE3526189BB78143B795EF9C45CB8CBB023F07C6@gbsbs.GB-Eng.local>

All,

 

A colleague brought up an interesting point about filters and fan BHp. 

 

Regarding 90.1-2007, Table 6.5.3.1.1A, Option 2, what is your
interpretation of "bhp = the maximum combined fan brake horsepower" for
an AHU?  And how does 90.1-2007 verify this?

 

90.1-2007 defines "fan system bhp" and "fan system design conditions";
however there isn't any clear mention of how exactly fan BHp is defined
with respect to filters (100% loaded filter delta-p, 66% loaded filter
delta-p, 33% loaded filter delta-p, etc.).  The fan system would still
meet capacity requirements, just at a reduced filter pressure drop as
scheduled.

 

For example, a designer could define (and schedule) the fan BHp to
operate at a max of 66% of allowable filter pressure drop for reduced
fan energy, yet schedule a fan motor to be able to meet the fully loaded
filter pressure drop.  

 

The ramifications of scheduling a lower fan BHp against 90.1-2007 is the
proposed system will now be operating more "efficiently", compared to
the baseline, assuming the filters are truly replaced at 66% of
allowable filter pressure drop (which likely would never happen in the
field!).  

 

Any thoughts on this?  Anyone on the 90.1-2007 committee that could shed
some insight?

 

Thanks,

Ryan

Hello All,

 

I am trying to understand the stated appendix for the baseline model. 

 

When I am calculating the Pfan for a system, do I need add up supply,
return, system and room exhaust cfm's? 

 

I got this comment from GBCI: "Revise the sum of the supply, return,
exhaust, and relief fans for each HVAC system to be equal to the volume
calculated in G3.1.2.8 and power calculated in G3.1.2.9 (where CFM
refers to supply air volume)."

 

 

Please let me know your input on how to calculate Pfan.

 

 

Thanks,

No, you use only the fan supply cfm to calculate the total fan power, then cut that fan power up into supply, return, etc.

My opinion is that if a designer "schedules" a fan bhp to meet a certain static pressure requirement, and then knowing that it will actually have to meet a higher static pressure (not as a safety factor but during normal operation) schedules a motor with a large enough nameplate hp to accommodate that, it is an attempt to get around the requirement in 90.1.

How does the calc apply for a fan coil system with 100% oa? Or is it  
only pertinent to vav? We had some gbc comments back asking to see the  
same calc for the proposed.

Hi Kim,

I'm fairly certain that there's no specific guidance in Appendix G.  What most people do is break it up so that it's proportional to the proposed case.  For example if the baseline fan power is 34.5 kW and the actual parameters call for 20 kW supply and 10 kW return you would break the baseline case up into 23 kW supply and 11.5 kW return.  I hope that helps.

No, you use only the fan supply cfm to calculate the total fan power, then cut that fan power up into supply, return, etc.

Hello All,

I am trying to understand the stated appendix for the baseline model.

When I am calculating the Pfan for a system, do I need add up supply, return, system and room exhaust cfm's?

I got this comment from GBCI: "Revise the sum of the supply, return, exhaust, and relief fans for each HVAC system to be equal to the volume calculated in G3.1.2.8 and power calculated in G3.1.2.9 (where CFM refers to supply air volume)."


Please let me know your input on how to calculate Pfan.


Thanks,

Hi Greg,

 

My basic question is which cfm do I take to calculate Pfan? Just the
supply to come up with kW/cfm or sum of supply, return, relief, and
exhaust fans?

Hi Kim,

 

I'm fairly certain that there's no specific guidance in Appendix G.
What most people do is break it up so that it's proportional to the
proposed case.  For example if the baseline fan power is 34.5 kW and the
actual parameters call for 20 kW supply and 10 kW return you would break
the baseline case up into 23 kW supply and 11.5 kW return.  I hope that
helps.

Message-ID: <BF1F81AEAA45B54399BF46028C53D59401B0C6BA@sv04005.rmf.com>

Hello,

 

ASHRAE defines a mass wall as a wall having a heat capacity (HC) of
greater than 7 BTU/ft2 * F but I have been unable to find this property
listed in tables of building materials. I am trying to calculate the
heat capacity of a CMU wall and would like to confirm that my
calculation methodology is correct.

 

Per ASHRAE 1997 Fundamentals:

*         8" concrete block - two cores filled with concrete (normal
weight) - ~130 lb/ft3

*         Thickness .67 ft

*         Specific Heat ~ 0.22 BTU/lb * F

 

Therefore NC =(130 lb/ft3 )*(.67 ft)*(0.22 BTU/lb * F)

 

NC=19.16

 

Using this methodology even a 4" brick wall has a HC greater than 7 (7.5
to be exact).

 

Thanks in advance.

I ran the exact same calc yesterday and came to the same
results/conclusion (using 4" brick and the 2001 Fundamentals...
spooky!).

 

My conclusion was any wall construction including 4"brick is a mass wall
by 90.1 definition, even if it should also use steel framing.

FYI, another comment on TRANE Trace 700:  the modeling engineers I hired
told me, after consultation with TRANE, that exposed interior concrete
floors, when modeled against the ASHRAE baseline of carpeted floors,
showed a reduction in the cooling load, but an increase in the heating
load.  An increase in the heating load was contrary to my reading in
passive solar books.  I used a simplified simulator for lay people, and
it showed exposed interior concrete floors improved cold-weather
performance over carpeted concrete (HEED, www2.aud.ucla.edu/heed).

I have since heard that TRANE does not model thermal mass well.  I have
also not been able to find anyone with experience modeling the thermal
mass of interior exposed concrete floors using any simulation tool.

Hi Paul,

My experience on EnergyPlus with this question led me to the conclusion that
the time-delayed release or gain of heat in interior concrete walls or
floors is a bit of a fiction.   Virtually all of this heat is picked within
the first hour by the mechanical systems.   Exterior concrete, likewise, had
very little impact on the occupant comfort and interior temperatures simply
because of the presence of insulation.   However, remove the cooling systems
(we do that here in Canada, particularly in residential high-rises) and the
picture is very different.

It would be interesting to repeat the same analysis on a building that is
fully designed to take advantage of passive heating and cooling. Few are, of
course. I suspect even partially passive buildings (mixed/hybrid mode) don't
experience even a fraction of the purported benefits of thermal mass.

The increase in the heating load is because the assembly is treated as one
R-value. Removing the carpet decreases the R and increases the heating load.

Certainly a reasonable conclusion -- if you assume the DOE software is
infallible.  I worked at a DOE national lab for 10 years.  They put
their pants on one leg at a time just like the rest of us.  That's where
I learned that engineers don't make mistakes.  They just have "events"
from which they "recover."  In the modeling study I commissioned after
leaving the DOE contractor job, we got the same result regardless of
whether we insulated the slab -- which was curious.  With the UCLA HEED
simulator, I got the best results with significant southern glazing --
which would support the passive solar idea.

Hi Paul,

My experience on EnergyPlus with this question led me to the conclusion
that
the time-delayed release or gain of heat in interior concrete walls or
floors is a bit of a fiction.   Virtually all of this heat is picked
within
the first hour by the mechanical systems.   Exterior concrete, likewise,
had
very little impact on the occupant comfort and interior temperatures
simply
because of the presence of insulation.   However, remove the cooling
systems
(we do that here in Canada, particularly in residential high-rises) and
the
picture is very different.

It would be interesting to repeat the same analysis on a building that
is
fully designed to take advantage of passive heating and cooling. Few
are, of
course. I suspect even partially passive buildings (mixed/hybrid mode)
don't
experience even a fraction of the purported benefits of thermal mass.

The increase in the heating load is because the assembly is treated as
one
R-value. Removing the carpet decreases the R and increases the heating
load.

FYI, another comment on TRANE Trace 700:  the modeling engineers I hired
told me, after consultation with TRANE, that exposed interior concrete
floors, when modeled against the ASHRAE baseline of carpeted floors,
showed
a reduction in the cooling load, but an increase in the heating load.
An
increase in the heating load was contrary to my reading in passive solar
books.  I used a simplified simulator for lay people, and it showed
exposed
interior concrete floors improved cold-weather performance over carpeted
concrete (HEED, www2.aud.ucla.edu/heed).

I have since heard that TRANE does not model thermal mass well.  I have
also
not been able to find anyone with experience modeling the thermal mass
of
interior exposed concrete floors using any simulation tool.

I use Trace 700 (v6.2.4).  Why? Because the first, second and third

I worked for used it.  It is good for running loads, but so-so for

The way I understand it, the effect of thermal mass is all in how the
heating/cooling loads are calculated.  TRACE is unique from many other
programs in that the user can choose the heating/cooling load
methodology that will be used.  Depending on your choice, thermal mass
will be calculated differently.  Most incorporate some kind of Transfer
Function Method (TFM), and each method is based on calculations and
algorithms from ASHRAE publications such as the 1972, 1985, and 2001
ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbooks, ASHRAE Research Project #359, and the
ASHRAE Toolkit for Building Load Calculations.

So the question of "What are the differences between TRACE and Energy
Simulation program 'X'?" is complicated by the additional question,
"Which Load Calculation Methodology in TRACE did you select?"

You need to have some mechanism for passively charging your mass to really
get the major energy benefits of the mass.  If you have a building that's
being actively heated and cooled all the time, with no passive inputs, then
the mass won't do much except reduce your peak thermal load some, provided
you get an actual temperature differential between the mass and the space
(i.e. the system is sized correctly and the space temperature exceeds the
typical set point at the peak hour).

So, you can couple passive solar input to your mass, and use that mass to
sink heat for later (rather than having the space temperature rise).  The
passive solar input to the space has to be higher than the thermal load on
the space for a while to get in energy benefit from the mass storage.  Or
you can use passive night cooling to cool your mass for later.

There are many situations where a building would not be able to take
advantage of mass, so anecdotes of one particular building model not
realizing savings from increased proves that not all buildings will see
improvements with increased mass, not that increased mass has zero savings
in all cases.  My personal experience in modeling mass shows that mass
makes a huge difference in the efficacy of passive heating and cooling
strategies.  I think this paper talks about some of what we found:

Erm, what passive solar books have you read?

Basically a layer of insulation (carpet) will reduce startup loads  
when the thermostat switches from, say, 15 degC setback to 21. Trane  
(although i cannot speak of the quality of its algorithms) is probably  
right.

It may be better to be uncarpetted if your heating doesn't have a  
setback. You don't get any startup heating load spikes then.

I don't know what methodology my people used.  I appreciate everyone's
input. I am concerned I should remain a viewer and not a participant on
this listserv since I am not a modeler -- only a consumer of modeling
services.  One data point that is not data, but confirmed to me that
thermal mass is real:  I brought an energy auditor to an
minimally-heated greenhouse at night and asked him to point his
thermographic gun at everything --including the concrete blocks holding
up the planting platforms.  Everything was blue and cold except the
concrete blocks which were yellow-red warm.

The way I understand it, the effect of thermal mass is all in how the
heating/cooling loads are calculated.  TRACE is unique from many other
programs in that the user can choose the heating/cooling load
methodology that will be used.  Depending on your choice, thermal mass
will be calculated differently.  Most incorporate some kind of Transfer
Function Method (TFM), and each method is based on calculations and
algorithms from ASHRAE publications such as the 1972, 1985, and 2001
ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbooks, ASHRAE Research Project #359, and the
ASHRAE Toolkit for Building Load Calculations.

So the question of "What are the differences between TRACE and Energy
Simulation program 'X'?" is complicated by the additional question,
"Which Load Calculation Methodology in TRACE did you select?"

FYI, another comment on TRANE Trace 700:  the modeling engineers I hired
told me, after consultation with TRANE, that exposed interior concrete
floors, when modeled against the ASHRAE baseline of carpeted floors,
showed a reduction in the cooling load, but an increase in the heating
load.  An increase in the heating load was contrary to my reading in
passive solar books.  I used a simplified simulator for lay people, and
it showed exposed interior concrete floors improved cold-weather
performance over carpeted concrete (HEED, www2.aud.ucla.edu/heed).

I have since heard that TRANE does not model thermal mass well.  I have
also not been able to find anyone with experience modeling the thermal
mass of interior exposed concrete floors using any simulation tool.

John,

It is like buying a car.  Do you want a truck, manual/automatic,
something
fast.......  You are asking for information overload.  If you know
exactly
what you want it may be easier for us (in this list) to help guide you
to the

I use Trace 700 (v6.2.4).  Why? Because the first, second and third
company I
worked for used it.  It is good for running loads, but so-so for energy

Erm, what passive solar books have you read?

Basically a layer of insulation (carpet) will reduce startup loads  
when the thermostat switches from, say, 15 degC setback to 21. Trane  
(although i cannot speak of the quality of its algorithms) is probably  
right.

It may be better to be uncarpetted if your heating doesn't have a  
setback. You don't get any startup heating load spikes then.

Fareed,

Set your supply air to room temp delta t equivalent to 20F.  Run the sim, if I am not mistaken this should generate usable airflow quantities to be used in point 9.  Make sure you have oversizing in place before any of this.  I have not been told this but I think G is set up to be done step by step from the beginning.  In some instances you need to update your model in order to proceed with the next step.  Good luck.

Kevin

Hi Kim,

I'm fairly certain that there's no specific guidance in Appendix G.  What most people do is break it up so that it's proportional to the proposed case.  For example if the baseline fan power is 34.5 kW and the actual parameters call for 20 kW supply and 10 kW return you would break the baseline case up into 23 kW supply and 11.5 kW return.  I hope that helps.

No, you use only the fan supply cfm to calculate the total fan power, then cut that fan power up into supply, return, etc.

Hello All,

I am trying to understand the stated appendix for the baseline model.

When I am calculating the Pfan for a system, do I need add up supply, return, system and room exhaust cfm's?

I got this comment from GBCI: "Revise the sum of the supply, return, exhaust, and relief fans for each HVAC system to be equal to the volume calculated in G3.1.2.8 and power calculated in G3.1.2.9 (where CFM refers to supply air volume)."


Please let me know your input on how to calculate Pfan.

To calculate total bhp, you would use the cfm across each fan and calculate
using the pressure increases across each fan and the efficiency's of each fan
(along with a constant).....then add them all up.  I don't know if this has
anything to do with G3.1.2.9.  Depending on whether your in IP or SI units,
you will come up with hp or kW.  If it was up to me, I would use (bhp or
kW)/(supply cfm) to do an energy analysis.  But, I'm not gbci.

call for 20 kW supply and 10 kW return you would break the baseline case up
into 23 kW supply and 11.5 kW return.  I hope that helps.

Gregg,

 

Is there guidance on what portion of the Pfan goes to each? What percentage
goes to supply, what percentage to return, etc?

No, you use only the fan supply cfm to calculate the total fan power, then
cut that fan power up into supply, return, etc.

Hello All,

 

I am trying to understand the stated appendix for the baseline model. 

 

When I am calculating the Pfan for a system, do I need add up supply, return,
system and room exhaust cfm's? 

 

I got this comment from GBCI: "Revise the sum of the supply, return, exhaust,
and relief fans for each HVAC system to be equal to the volume calculated in
G3.1.2.8 and power calculated in G3.1.2.9 (where CFM refers to supply air
volume)." 

 

 

Please let me know your input on how to calculate Pfan.

 

 

Thanks,

  Fareed,

   

  Set your supply air to room temp delta t equivalent to 20F.  Run the sim, if I am not mistaken this should generate usable airflow quantities to be used in point 9.  Make sure you have oversizing in place before any of this.  I have not been told this but I think G is set up to be done step by step from the beginning.  In some instances you need to update your model in order to proceed with the next step.  Good luck.

  Hi Greg,

   

  My basic question is which cfm do I take to calculate Pfan? Just the supply to come up with kW/cfm or sum of supply, return, relief, and exhaust fans?

  Hi Kim,

   

  I'm fairly certain that there's no specific guidance in Appendix G.  What most people do is break it up so that it's proportional to the proposed case.  For example if the baseline fan power is 34.5 kW and the actual parameters call for 20 kW supply and 10 kW return you would break the baseline case up into 23 kW supply and 11.5 kW return.

The heat balance switches direction at night. From the blocks  
absorbing heat in the day to giving it off at night. A trombe wall  
also works this way.

In reference to your last question, where a building is designed to  
maximise passive solar then yes exposed concrete could work better.

For a traditionally serviced building, if it's heating intensive but  
also intermittently heated, go lightweight and well insulated. If it's  
cooling intensive maximise exposed thermal mass.

Are you using eQUEST for modeling?   If so, you can right click in the
"Static in WG" box and hit "Restore Default".  This will enable the
"Design kW/CFM" input field.

place before any of this.  I have not been told this but I think G is
set up to be done step by step from the beginning.  In some instances
you need to update your model in order to proceed with the next step.
Good luck.

	My basic question is which cfm do I take to calculate Pfan? Just
the supply to come up with kW/cfm or sum of supply, return, relief, and

	Hi Kim,

	 

	I'm fairly certain that there's no specific guidance in Appendix
G.  What most people do is break it up so that it's proportional to the
proposed case.  For example if the baseline fan power is 34.5 kW and the
actual parameters call for 20 kW supply and 10 kW return you would break
the baseline case up into 23 kW supply and 11.5 kW return.  I hope that
helps.

	Hello All,

	 

	I am trying to understand the stated appendix for the baseline
model. 

	 

	When I am calculating the Pfan for a system, do I need add up
supply, return, system and room exhaust cfm's? 

	 

	I got this comment from GBCI: "Revise the sum of the supply,
return, exhaust, and relief fans for each HVAC system to be equal to the
volume calculated in G3.1.2.8 and power calculated in G3.1.2.9 (where
CFM refers to supply air volume)."

Subject: [Bldg-sim] ASHRAE 90.1 "HC" heat capacity

 

Hello,

 

ASHRAE defines a mass wall as a wall having a heat capacity (HC) of greater
than 7 BTU/ft2 * F but I have been unable to find this property listed in
tables of building materials. I am trying to calculate the heat capacity of
a CMU wall and would like to confirm that my calculation methodology is
correct.

 

Per ASHRAE 1997 Fundamentals:

.         8" concrete block - two cores filled with concrete (normal weight)
- ~130 lb/ft3

.         Thickness .67 ft

.         Specific Heat ~ 0.22 BTU/lb * F

 

Therefore NC =(130 lb/ft3 )*(.67 ft)*(0.22 BTU/lb * F)

 

NC=19.16

 

Using this methodology even a 4" brick wall has a HC greater than 7 (7.5 to
be exact).

 

Thanks in advance.

  Are you using eQUEST for modeling?   If so, you can right click in the "Static in WG" box and hit "Restore Default".  This will enable the "Design kW/CFM" input field.

  I am working on a model doing the exact same thing for LEEDS baseline.  I have calculated my Pfan but cant seem to input it or get the correct outputs.  

   

  The model wont allow me to enter anything in the kW/cfm screen. My equipment is a PSZ

   

  Should I adjust the Static Pressures and efficiencies to get the same value?

    Fareed,

     

    Set your supply air to room temp delta t equivalent to 20F.  Run the sim, if I am not mistaken this should generate usable airflow quantities to be used in point 9.  Make sure you have oversizing in place before any of this.  I have not been told this but I think G is set up to be done step by step from the beginning.

Hi Bldg-Sim Community,
I had a confusion that you all might be help out.
When someone says that they want a chiller with 25% more efficiency than the
baseline dictated by ASHRAE 90.1, does it mean the COP should be 25%
greater?

ADIABATIC COOLING

Seems to me there is no way to simulate adiabatic cooling in eQuest.

Maybe I need to use EnergyPlus or TRNSYS for this purpose.

Perhaps someone knows otherwise.

Maybe you can tell me what the COP of a chiller means then, given that it
varies with load, how do you come up with a single COP for a chiller?  Or is
it just the average COP given the operating conditions that the chiller
experiences?  Or are you talking about the integrated part load value?  
 
But yes, however you define the efficiency, (COP, EER, or Power/Ton), I am
geussing that the load removed per unit of input will have to increase by
25%.

not debating the fact the COP would be constant. I just needed to know that
what does increase in 25% efficiency actuallu mean. I personally thought
having a chiller whose kw/ton was lower than that recommended  by ASHRAE
90.1 would be good. Needed to confirm that.

Finding, say, a 500-ton centrifugal chiller with a rated COP of 7.625
(6.1 required by ASHRAE * 1.25) is not going to be an easy task.

 

I think you should look at finding a chiller whose annual energy
consumption is 25% less than an ASHRAE 90.1 chiller (ie 25%
"better")...that's a much more reasonable expectation, given
frictionless bearings, VFDs, etc.

Hi Harakhlaal, 

 

I'm not sure whether I can provide any clear answers, but I am quite
curious to see the answer to your question.

 

I recall discussing adiabatic heating/cooling in my thermodynamics
courses... it's basically the concept of raising/lowering temperatures
without adding or removing heat, but instead rather through changes in
fluid volume/pressure, right?  A real-world example of something akin to
this might be a spraypaint can getting cold as you release its
pressurized contents.

 

If that's the case, I'm struggling to understand why you might wish to
model such behavior within a building energy simulation... kinda sounds
hazardous to the health of the occupants =)!  

 

Would you please describe your purpose a bit further?  Is there a
specific system/situation you are trying to model?  This may help others
help you determine a more appropriate tool-of-choice.  As a guess, are
you possibly trying to account for cooling in a space due to a
pressurized tank undergoing adiabatic cooling as it releases gas into
another system?

 

Back to fundamentals, and something I'd like to ask of those more
knowledgeable... I know for certain in DOE2.2/eQuest you can set up a
space with a set volume and with adiabatic (or no) surfaces - which will
account for preventing heat transfer, but I have not been exposed to
DOE2.2/eQuest varying the space pressure/volume over time, so I would
concur that this might not be possible in a literal sense... is this the
case?

The DOE Commercial Building Benchmark Energy Models for existing buildings have been posted.  There are three sets of models - new construction following 90.1-2004, post-1980 mostly following 90.1-1989, and pre-1980.  The 90.1-2004 versions have been available, but the post-1980 and pre-1980 models have recently been completed and posted to the DOE website.  There are 16 building types and 16 locations for each vintage.  The models are available as EnergyPlus 4.0 input files.  Also available are the EnergyPlus html output file and a spreadsheet "scorecard" that documents the model inputs and the results from the EnergyPlus simulation.  Updated versions will be made available a few weeks after the next release of EnergyPlus in April.

You can access the models at

I have a baseline model and 11 alternate cases set up in eQuest's life cycle cost analysis menu.  When I view the life-cycle cost summary under Reports in Output mode, I only see the baseline and 10 alternates.  I can add the last alternate by clicking on it in the Projects/Runs tab, but it bumps one of the other alternates off the list.  Anyone know if there is a way to include all 11 alternates, or if eQuest is limited to 10?

Paul, back to your original question, this document may help.  There is also
a document with a side-by-side comparison table, somewhere. I'll see if I
can find it and send it to you.

If you've been reading through bldg-sim, you'll find modellers tend to get
sidetracked easily.

One data point that is not data, but confirmed to me that thermal mass is

night and asked him to point his thermographic gun at everything --including
the concrete blocks holding up the planting platforms.  Everything was blue
and cold except the concrete blocks which were yellow-red warm.

The way I understand it, the effect of thermal mass is all in how the
heating/cooling loads are calculated.  TRACE is unique from many other
programs in that the user can choose the heating/cooling load methodology
that will be used.  Depending on your choice, thermal mass will be
calculated differently.  Most incorporate some kind of Transfer Function
Method (TFM), and each method is based on calculations and algorithms from
ASHRAE publications such as the 1972, 1985, and 2001 ASHRAE Fundamentals
Handbooks, ASHRAE Research Project #359, and the ASHRAE Toolkit for Building
Load Calculations.

So the question of "What are the differences between TRACE and Energy
Simulation program 'X'?" is complicated by the additional question, "Which
Load Calculation Methodology in TRACE did you select?"

FYI, another comment on TRANE Trace 700:  the modeling engineers I hired
told me, after consultation with TRANE, that exposed interior concrete
floors, when modeled against the ASHRAE baseline of carpeted floors, showed
a reduction in the cooling load, but an increase in the heating load.  An
increase in the heating load was contrary to my reading in passive solar
books.  I used a simplified simulator for lay people, and it showed exposed
interior concrete floors improved cold-weather performance over carpeted
concrete (HEED, www2.aud.ucla.edu/heed).

I have since heard that TRANE does not model thermal mass well.  I have also
not been able to find anyone with experience modeling the thermal mass of
interior exposed concrete floors using any simulation tool.

John,

It is like buying a car.  Do you want a truck, manual/automatic, something
fast.......  You are asking for information overload.  If you know exactly
what you want it may be easier for us (in this list) to help guide you to
the best option.

I also was once curious and found the link below.  The end of the paper has
charts comparing different features.

Another sight.
http://www.wbdg.org/resources/energyanalysis.php


I use Trace 700 (v6.2.4).  Why? Because the first, second and third company
I worked for used it.  It is good for running loads, but so-so for energy
modeling.  Also I have never used anything else.  I have looked at equest
and DOE, they both look like learning a completely new programming language.


I wouldn't mind hearing other people's brief views of the programs they use.

Has there been any information released on the differences between

Message-ID: <AE3526189BB78143B795EF9C45CB8CBB0246FE3F@gbsbs.GB-Eng.local>

All,

 

I'm just playing devil's advocate here...

 

What is stopping me from scheduling a lower fan BHp that meets say a 66%
loaded filter, but providing a fan motor that can truly handle a fully
loaded filter (even with some safety), assuming I still comply with
section 6.5.3.1.2?  Because the 90.1-2007 fan BHp baseline is not
tracking of the proposed fan BHp, this would give me a "better"
performing building.

 

Although I do not see the above approach as honest, nothing is
indicating in 90.1-2007 that this cannot be done.  Unless I missed
something...

 

Again, I'm not supporting this be done, but am curious where in
90.1-2007 that it clearly calls out this is not to be done.  

 

As a side note, I don't believe the 2008 CA Energy Code even offers a
limitation to the designer not scheduling a lower CFM.  The baseline
building tracks the fan energy up to a defined W/CFM, not really
crediting a designer for real fan energy savings (i.e. larger ducts,
better duct design, larger coils (for lower face velocity), etc.).
Although a designer may not get credited for the "lower" fan energy with
scheduling an artificially low fan BHp for a cleaner filter, they may
not get penalized as much as if they scheduled a BHp for a fully loaded
filter.

 

Any thoughts on this?  Anyone on the 90.1-2007 committee that could shed
some insight?

 

Thanks,

Ryan

Dedicated Outdoor Air System. It is an airhandler that delivers treated 
outdoor air to the zone. It can be used with variety of systems. I used 
it a lot in conjunction with  terminal units (fan coils). If properly 
designed, DOAS will limit humidity raise at part load conditions.

Dear Sambhav,

 

There is good information available from ASHRAE which you should read about
DOAS.

 

A brief understanding is that certain HVAC systems, such as chilled beams,
VRF and water-source heat pumps, are used to remove zone sensible cooling or
heating loads.  They are very effective at this function but do not provide
outdoor air ventilation for the zones.  As a result, a separate HVAC system
is provided for the express purpose of providing ventilation air.  This is
called a Dedicated Outdoor Air System (DOAS).

This discussion has perhaps underlined the differences in terminology  
between the US (where a significant part of development takes place)  
and the rest of the world.

For example, in the UK 90%+ of systems using an AHU are "DOAS" but I'd  
never heard of the term before dealing with E+.

Another thing we have come accross is the applcation of Fancoil  
systems appears to vary significantly between the US and EU. In Europe  
most fan coil systems are augmented by "DOAS". They can also be quite  
advanced pieces of kit with electically commutated (EC) fan motors for  
efficiency.

This is merely my observation from E+ where the Fourpipe fancoil  
object is quite dumb (i.e. Single speed fan that doesn't modulate on/ 
off with the load).

I say quite dumb... It's obviously more clever than me!

I resisted jumping in on this discussion earlier, but Chris' comment 
motivated me to say that my experiences in China are very similar, and
that perhaps it's the US that's out of step with a lot of the world.

The standard HVAC system in Chinese buildings, i.e., at least 90% of
the time, are fan-coil units with a "DOAS" to provide conditioned fresh 
air. The "DOAS" are essential because of the high outdoor humidity
during the summe. Of course, they're not known as "DOAS"; I only learned 
that terminology when I explained the system to a US consultant.

It seems that when the US HVAC industry went to all-air systems in the
50's (?), fan-coil systems became stigmatized as archaic and their 
designs stagnated. That's not the case in other parts of the world.

Adding a personal note on the fan-coil units and DOAS - in the office I was
previously in I setup a occupant survey when we were in the process to
attain LEED Silver certification (we go it!). The office was in a 20 some
floor office tower with fan coils on the perimeter for the envelope load,
the interior was arranged as an open office space and served by 8 VAV
boxes. This office had almost no complaints from any occupants in the open
offices. The majority of thermal comfort / acoustic complaints were from
individuals seated in the individual office suites at the core of the
building (where they had no control of their environment).

The office also had blinds to block solar radiation that occupants could
choose to  use - and everyone did. Also we ended up purchasing small desk
fans and a few Herman Miller C2 personal comfort devices for occupants in
the offices to provide them a level of individual control. This could be
called points-chasing but everyone appreciated the devices and was happy.
The Herman Miller C2 devices can be used for heating and cooling - or if
you place your computer with the business end facing towards you (like I
do) you have a free 400W heater.

Similar to the experience of Joe about China, fan coil based system are
quite popular in India too, but, except for the green building community,
not many people are using DOAS. Rather, I would say, not many people are
aware about importance of the same.

Paul, back to your original question, this document may help.? There is also
a document with a side-by-side comparison table, somewhere. I'll see if I
can find it and send it to you.

If you've been reading through bldg-sim, you'll find modellers tend to get
sidetracked easily.

I don't know what methodology my people used.? I appreciate everyone's
input. I am concerned I should remain a viewer and not a participant on this
listserv since I am not a modeler -- only a consumer of modeling services.
One data point that is not data, but confirmed to me that thermal mass is
real:? I brought an energy auditor to an minimally-heated greenhouse at
night and asked him to point his thermographic gun at everything --including
the concrete blocks holding up the planting platforms.? Everything was blue
and cold except the concrete blocks which were yellow-red warm.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] differences between energy simulations programs

The way I understand it, the effect of thermal mass is all in how the
heating/cooling loads are calculated.? TRACE is unique from many other
programs in that the user can choose the heating/cooling load methodology
that will be used.? Depending on your choice, thermal mass will be
calculated differently.? Most incorporate some kind of Transfer Function
Method (TFM), and each method is based on calculations and algorithms from
ASHRAE publications such as the 1972, 1985, and 2001 ASHRAE Fundamentals
Handbooks, ASHRAE Research Project #359, and the ASHRAE Toolkit for Building
Load Calculations.

So the question of "What are the differences between TRACE and Energy
Simulation program 'X'?" is complicated by the additional question, "Which
Load Calculation Methodology in TRACE did you select?"

FYI, another comment on TRANE Trace 700:? the modeling engineers I hired
told me, after consultation with TRANE, that exposed interior concrete
floors, when modeled against the ASHRAE baseline of carpeted floors, showed
a reduction in the cooling load, but an increase in the heating load.? An
increase in the heating load was contrary to my reading in passive solar
books.? I used a simplified simulator for lay people, and it showed exposed
interior concrete floors improved cold-weather performance over carpeted
concrete (HEED, www2.aud.ucla.edu/heed).

I have since heard that TRANE does not model thermal mass well.? I have also
not been able to find anyone with experience modeling the thermal mass of
interior exposed concrete floors using any simulation tool.

John,

It is like buying a car.? Do you want a truck, manual/automatic, something
fast.......? You are asking for information overload.? If you know exactly
what you want it may be easier for us (in this list) to help guide you to
the best option.

I also was once curious and found the link below.? The end of the paper has
charts comparing different features.

Another sight.
http://www.wbdg.org/resources/energyanalysis.php


I use Trace 700 (v6.2.4).? Why? Because the first, second and third company
I worked for used it.? It is good for running loads, but so-so for energy
modeling.? Also I have never used anything else.? I have looked at equest
and DOE, they both look like learning a completely new programming language.


I wouldn't mind hearing other people's brief views of the programs they use.
Equest, DOE, HAP, ect.

Dear all,

a while ago we had a conversation on CO2-levels in hospitals. In Belgium,
the Flemish government is currently measuring the indoor CO2 and VOC-levels
in many *houses* throughout the Flemish part of the country. The levels they
have currently set as target are extremely low. Therefore, I want to know
what the target values for CO2, and possibly also for VOC, are for
*houses*in other countries.

Thanks already!

All:

I am modeling a two story office building that is 20,000 square feet.  The actual building employs a packaged rooftop unit with VAV's and electric reheat.  If I read ASHRAE 90.1 correctly, I am to use System 4 for the baseline modeling.  This is in stark contrast to what is actually installed.  

If I am understanding this correctly, do I take from this that Packaged Single Zone Heat Pumps are preferred in this application?  

Thanks,

Mike Porter

I'm still not convinced of the accuracy of CO2 sensors at the concentrations
that are "meaningful" to IAQ. For example, a sensor I looked at last year
gave a 0 to 10V signal in the CO2 range 350 to 2500ppm. Ashrae 62.1 states
(from memory) that a concentration of 700ppm is analogous to a mechanical
ventilation rate of 7.5 l/s/person. That only gives you a couple of those 10
volts to modulate the signal over.

 

Anyway Leen, you could try ASHRAE 62.1. It has a few tables and Appendices
in the back for various locations (not just US). It is commercial, but if
you look you may find a domestic/ housing equivalent.

the Flemish government is currently measuring the indoor CO2 and VOC-levels
in many houses throughout the Flemish part of the country. The levels they
have currently set as target are extremely low. Therefore, I want to know
what the target values for CO2, and possibly also for VOC, are for houses in
other countries.

 

Thanks already!

 

Leen Peeters,

Belgium

Paul,

 

I would like to console/assure you of something, just because any given
energy model doesn't show specific behavior doesn't mean it's not real,
and it doesn't mean the person who put that model together doesn't
"believe" in it.  More often than not, the program simply can't handle
what we're trying to model explicitly/cleanly, if at all!  The science
of building energy modeling is ever-developing.  Every month new
software and methods are developed that allow us to grow and accurately
model more things.

 

Speaking specifically to eQuest, I can't purport to be an expert - as
I've yet to be tasked to model thermal massing options comparatively,
but I'm aware explicitly modeling the thermal massing qualities of any
given zone's contents/floor constructions is a possibility (see attached
screengrab - rightmost inputs).  The constructions you define for your
envelope walls/floors/roofs and interior walls also defines the mass
properties that, by default, will account for the storage and transfer
of heat over time - though users can and often do choose to model such
elements without heat storage/transfer if necessary for tangent reasons.
That said, my general impression from reading others' discussions on the
topic (in the eQuest mailing list), is that when it comes to comparative
modeling of specific constructions (i.e. carpeted SOG vs. bare slabs),
it does become fuzzy as to how to accurately model both cases.

 

John,

 

If I can venture a guess for Shaun... I think it has something to do
with long hours, caffeine overdosage, deadlines, model reviewers, and
the quirky but pleasant company/support available through these mailing
lists...  Also, what was the question? =)

 

~Nick

Paul, back to your original question, this document may help.  There is
also
a document with a side-by-side comparison table, somewhere. I'll see if
I
can find it and send it to you.

If you've been reading through bldg-sim, you'll find modellers tend to
get
sidetracked easily.

I don't know what methodology my people used.  I appreciate everyone's
input. I am concerned I should remain a viewer and not a participant on
this
listserv since I am not a modeler -- only a consumer of modeling
services.
One data point that is not data, but confirmed to me that thermal mass
is
real:  I brought an energy auditor to an minimally-heated greenhouse at
night and asked him to point his thermographic gun at everything
--including
the concrete blocks holding up the planting platforms.  Everything was
blue
and cold except the concrete blocks which were yellow-red warm.

Subject: RE: [Bldg-sim] differences between energy simulations programs

The way I understand it, the effect of thermal mass is all in how the
heating/cooling loads are calculated.  TRACE is unique from many other
programs in that the user can choose the heating/cooling load
methodology
that will be used.  Depending on your choice, thermal mass will be
calculated differently.  Most incorporate some kind of Transfer Function
Method (TFM), and each method is based on calculations and algorithms
from
ASHRAE publications such as the 1972, 1985, and 2001 ASHRAE Fundamentals
Handbooks, ASHRAE Research Project #359, and the ASHRAE Toolkit for
Building
Load Calculations.

So the question of "What are the differences between TRACE and Energy
Simulation program 'X'?" is complicated by the additional question,
"Which
Load Calculation Methodology in TRACE did you select?"

FYI, another comment on TRANE Trace 700:  the modeling engineers I hired
told me, after consultation with TRANE, that exposed interior concrete
floors, when modeled against the ASHRAE baseline of carpeted floors,
showed
a reduction in the cooling load, but an increase in the heating load.
An
increase in the heating load was contrary to my reading in passive solar
books.  I used a simplified simulator for lay people, and it showed
exposed
interior concrete floors improved cold-weather performance over carpeted
concrete (HEED, www2.aud.ucla.edu/heed).

I have since heard that TRANE does not model thermal mass well.  I have
also
not been able to find anyone with experience modeling the thermal mass
of
interior exposed concrete floors using any simulation tool.

John,

It is like buying a car.  Do you want a truck, manual/automatic,

exactly
what you want it may be easier for us (in this list) to help guide you

I also was once curious and found the link below.  The end of the paper
has

Another sight.

I use Trace 700 (v6.2.4).  Why? Because the first, second and third
company
I worked for used it.  It is good for running loads, but so-so for
energy
modeling.  Also I have never used anything else.  I have looked at
equest
and DOE, they both look like learning a completely new programming
language.


I wouldn't mind hearing other people's brief views of the programs they
use.
Equest, DOE, HAP, ect.

The best overall advice I can give is... 90.1 Baseline's aren't supposed
to make sense.  ;)

 

The more nuanced response would be... they aren't supposed to reflect
common design, necessarily.  Yes, the system and it's properties vary
with climate, occupancy and building-size/properties... but don't
misinterpret any part of the prescriptive baseline requirements as being
any more than a baseline - an objective set of decisions from which we
can measure a comparative performance level.  

 

To check your findings, as I happen to have 90.1-2004 in front of me,
you are correct assuming your proposed design has electric heating and
assuming you're working under 90.1-2004. 

 

PSZ's are not "preferred" unless the engineer of record decides they
are, regardless of what your baseline happens to be.

All:

 

I am modeling a two story office building that is 20,000 square feet.
The actual building employs a packaged rooftop unit with VAV's and
electric reheat.  If I read ASHRAE 90.1 correctly, I am to use System 4
for the baseline modeling.  This is in stark contrast to what is
actually installed.  

 

If I am understanding this correctly, do I take from this that Packaged
Single Zone Heat Pumps are preferred in this application?  

 

Thanks,

 

Mike Porter

an Acrobat problem.  You might try some of the suggestions in this

Dear All,

 

I have a couple of questions about an industrial building I am modeling at
the moment (bottle filling company).

 

In the different zones of the warehouse (production and filling of bottles,
storage, laboratories, etc.) they are not planning to install HVAC systems.
But all of these zones are occupied constantly by the workers (8760 hours a
year), although the occupancy density is quite small (e.g. 40 people/20.000
m2). Without HVAC systems we definitely don?t reach the comfort temperatures
during all the 8760 hours, so I am not sure if it?s actually possible to
consider these zones without HVAC systems?! 

Besides that, I was wondering if we can change the lower temperature limit
considering special thermal clothing for the workers?  

 

I look forward to your response.

 

Regards,

Lizzy

Sounds right to me.   I've wondered about the relatively low "U" for
basements, too.  My best guess for ASHRAE's rationale is that the additional
heating load is balanced by reduced cooling load..

My understanding of this:
?
With parallel or series PIUs this is the temperature schedule for when the zone fans turn on. I think the default is to schedule this for the heating schedule. So in heating mode, when the space temperature drops below the setpoint, the zone fan circulates first before the AHU.

Hi All,
??????????? There is a Shedule type as TEMPERATURE for PIU in which the values for occupied hrs are taken by default as 77F .Can anyone tell for what this schedule type is used. Is it used for some specific type of HVAC system or for all typre of system.

I look forward for your response.

Hi

 

I have question in relation to the use of ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G for
pharmaceutical manufacturing buildings and would be interested to hear
from anybody with experience in this area.

 

My company at the moment are involved in a number of Pharmaceutical
projects where the clients are interested in pursing LEED for
manufacturing buildings.

These buildings typically would have very high process loads, and a
large number of clean rooms with high air-changes etc. 

 

We are wondering is practical to apply LEED to these type of buildings,
and in particular would it be difficult to achieve a good result against
ASHRAE 90.1 Appendix G. on the optimise energy credit given these types
of buildings are energy hungry. 

 

Assuming given the scale of the buildings and the special pressurisation
relationships and requirement for high air changes the basecase would by
type 3 or type 4, a single zone constant air handling unit with reheat
for humidity control.

 

Also the design flowrates would be based on mandatory air-change
requirements rather then supply temperature differential.

 

It is likely the proposed case would involve a mixture of constant
volume systems with reheat (possibly primary secondary AHU
configuration) and VAV systems.

 

I would just like to get an indication if this likely to achieve the 4
point minimum or possible improve on it and are there are any other
complicating issues for buildings of this type.

 

Regards

 Outdoor Air System
Message-ID: <63362.85.101.99.238.1270014761.squirrel@webmail.mimtarch.com>

Dear All,

Looking at the LEED submittal form for the IEQ Pr1 Minimum Indoor Air
Quality Performance I am really confused. Having assumed that this will be
very easy with a constant volume system that works only with 100% outdoor
air (no recirculation), I see now that the form requires entering Ev
(system efficiency) values for each zone???

First of all, isn't this meaningless? 62.1 standard uses Ev values for
systems that are multiple-zone and recirculating. What is the point in
entering an Ev value for each zone?

Second, since I am forced to enter this value (otherwise the form does not
calculate), what do you suggest I enter? My system is constant volume and
rates that are 30% higher than 62.1 requirements are ducted to each zone
without recirculation. Slightly less airflow rates are achieved for
exhaust, again ducted from each zone and exhausted directly to the outisde
without any recirculation.

Thanks for any replies,

Message-ID: <COL112-W57053ED36F1629FE11295DBC1E0@phx.gbl>


About a year ago, there was a posting asking about user experiences with the new EnergyPro version 5, which is capable of automatically generating a 90.1 baseline model, but there were no responses at the time. 

http://www.energysoft.com/main/page_energypro_nonresidenital_modules.html

 

Has anyone used it yet and have feedback to share on the quality of its interpretation of Appendix G? I've used older versions of EnergyPro before, but I'm specifically looking for feedback on the 90.1 compliance functionality. 

 

My experience with EnergyPro for Title 24 compliance is that, beyond specifying the details of your proposed building, there is very limited control over how that is transformed in the baseline model and how the T-24 ACM is interpreted (probably a good thing). It is what it is and there is no way to explicitly edit the baseline model. eQUEST, on the other hand, typically crashes during Title 24 compliance runs, but once it runs, there is always the possibility of taking the auto-generated proposed and standard model input files and "fixing them." 

 

Without the possibility of applying a human touch to the interpretation of the nitty gritty in Appendix G and all of the particulars of new building designs out there, I imagine it would be very difficult to create a robust compliance engine that would work for every situation. On the other hand, it might be nice not to *be able* to look at and, therefore, not *have to* look at the details of the baseline building... but I haven't used it yet.

 

Thanks for any feedback.

 

Hwakong

In basement rooms that I have modeled, additional insulation usually has little impact if the space has internal loads that require cooling. The reduced heating energy is offset by additional cooling, since you can no longer get as much cooling from the "cold wall." However, if the room is only heated (no cooling), then insulation makes a big difference. I discovered this when I noticed heating during the summer. (The summer heating went away when I lowered the thermostat setpoint from the default setpoint. It was a utility room.)

I wanted to run something by everyone to see if this is how most people model underground walls:

For my climate zone (4A), the required C-factor for Underground Wall is 1.140 (no U-value listed).

If you go to Appendix A of 90.1-2004, specifically sections A4.1 and Table A4.2, I *think* that you come to the conclusion that the baseline underground walls should be modeled as 8 inch medium weight concrete block with a density of 115 lb/ft3, solid grouted cores, and NO INSULATION.  This is what A4.1 says, and the published C-factors in Table A4.2 indicate that a C-factor of 1.140 is obtained using this wall and no framing / no insulation.

If you then refer to Table A3.1C, for that wall type, sure enough a C-factor of 1.140 is listed with a corresponding U-value of 0.58.

When I run my baseline model with an underground wall construction having a U-value of 0.58, I end up with way more cooling hours and energy that my proposed model, which has R-13 insulation.  This is presumably because those underground spaces are constantly losing heat thru the poor wall construction to the 55 degree earth heat sink (or whatever eQuest calculates it as).

I'm not complaining, as it makes the proposed system look that much more efficient, but I just wanted to double check that I'm doing this right.

On a side note, I'm having a tough time reducing my unmet load hours for the underground VAV system, but that's besides the point...

Hwakong,

 

My experience with EnergyPro v5 is that the baseline building is not
correctly modeled.  The envelope criteria are often applied correctly,
but HVAC-related metrics such as fan power are incorrectly calculated.
Compounding the problem are report-population errors; it is sometimes
impossible to tell if the simulation is correct but the auto-filled
report is wrong, or if the simulation and report are both wrong.  I know
for certain that fan power is incorrect because it can be cross-checked
with the standard DOE2 SV-A reports in addition to the auto-filled LEED
EAc1 report.  However, other baseline metrics such as those described in
90.1-2007 G3.1.3.4 (hot water reset schedule) and G3.1.3.8 (chilled
water design temperatures) are much more difficult to verify.  I agree
with your assessment that there is virtually no control over the
baseline and would add that there is insufficient control over the
proposed model, too.  To summarize my major complaints:

 

*         Appendix G is incorrectly applied/report mistakes are normal
and there is no way to fix them

*         There is very little customization available; it is nowhere
near the caliber of eQUEST, EnergyPlus, etc.

*         There are no substantial self-training resources (text- or
video-based)

*         The user group is focused almost exclusively on issues
pertaining to T24 compliance and T24 report errors

*         EnergySoft's support, while responsive, lacks customer service
skills and seems to operate under the assumption that all issues lie
with the user.  I also suspect Support has misinformed me about
EnergyPro's capabilities - I was told it can accurately model a DOAS
with heat recovery, but how can this be if it is built on the DOE2.1e
engine?  There's no way to verify accuracy if I cannot parse hourly
reports. 

 

In short, the only value I see in purchasing EnergyPro (outside of T24
compliance) is the incorporation of VRV products.  Once VRV is
incorporated into other software, my firm plans to discontinue using
EnergyPro for the reasons above.

About a year ago, there was a posting asking about user experiences with
the new EnergyPro version 5, which is capable of automatically
generating a 90.1 baseline model, but there were no responses at the
time. 

 

http://www.energysoft.com/main/page_energypro_nonresidenital_modules.htm

Has anyone used it yet and have feedback to share on the quality of its
interpretation of Appendix G? I've used older versions of EnergyPro
before, but I'm specifically looking for feedback on the 90.1 compliance
functionality. 

 

 

 

My experience with EnergyPro for Title 24 compliance is that, beyond
specifying the details of your proposed building, there is very limited
control over how that is transformed in the baseline model and how the
T-24 ACM is interpreted (probably a good thing). It is what it is and
there is no way to explicitly edit the baseline model. eQUEST, on the
other hand, typically crashes during Title 24 compliance runs, but once
it runs, there is always the possibility of taking the auto-generated
proposed and standard model input files and "fixing them." 

 

 

 

Without the possibility of applying a human touch to the interpretation
of the nitty gritty in Appendix G and all of the particulars of new
building designs out there, I imagine it would be very difficult to
create a robust compliance engine that would work for every situation.
On the other hand, it might be nice not to *be able* to look at and,
therefore, not *have to* look at the details of the baseline building...
but I haven't used it yet.

 

 

 

Thanks for any feedback.

Dear all,

 

I meant to send this yesterday but the clock ticked over midnight. I am
dead serious: jEPlus has gone open source (under GPLv3) and here is the
proof: http://sourceforge.net/projects/jeplus/

 

Although EnergyPlus is now providing a number of functions (parametric,
SQL output etc) natively, I believe there is still much jEPlus can
offer. I hope turning it into a community project will help it grow. My
special thanks to Davis Marques, who has joined the project and was the
reason that this happened before Easter in the first place. I would like
to welcome more developers and users to join the project, too.

 

Best wishes,

 

Yi

About the Abstracts

Technical papers are solicited for the 2010 Symposium on Improving Building Systems in Hot and Humid Climates to be held August 24-26, 2010. The Symposium will be held during 24-25 with the post-workshops on the 26th. The Symposium will be held in conjunction with the Clean Air Through Energy Efficiency 2010 Conference (CATEE). Together these create a unique blend of symposia dedicated to energy efficiency and clean air. The conference site will be the AT&T Conference Center located at the AT&T Conference Center on the University of Texas campus, Austin, Texas. This unique and premier conference focuses principally on building air conditioning performance in hot and humid climates. Attendees are upper level energy managers, building managers, architects, designers, consultants, utility representatives, code officials, equipment manufacturers and suppliers, consumers and researchers from around the world.
The purpose of the symposium is to accomplish technology transfer?from the laboratories of leading academic institutions, research organizations and industry; and from the best practices of practicing design and operations professionals?to the building industry at large. Identification of new equipment and processes is of major importance. However, the paper and presentation should be free of commercialism.

Authors wishing to present a paper for consideration must submit a 200-400 word abstract for each proposed paper no later than FRIDAY, APRIL 30, 2010 (electronic format required). All abstracts will be peer reviewed, and the acceptance based on content quality, originality and composition. A draft copy of an accepted paper must be received by Wednesday, June 16, 2010. The final corrected manuscripts must be received by Wednesday, August 4, 2010.

Papers are usually allotted 20-25 minutes for presentation, followed by a five-minute discussion. The presenter of each paper receives a reduced registration rate to the symposium which includes a copy of the proceedings and admission to all technical sessions.

Subject: [Bldg-sim] LEED Comments for EAC1 - Optimize Energy Performance
Message-ID: <20100401030024.GA14443@mail19j.g19.rapidsite.net>

Hello,

 

I received some comments from USGBC regarding my project initial review, in
Credit EAC1 ? Optimize Energy Performance. Please advise me how I can solve
below mentioned comments in the review submission,

 

1.	It is unclear whether one Baseline Constant Volume system was
modeled per thermal zone in the Baseline Case as required. Please verify
that one system was modeled per zone, and that the Baseline System
efficiency for each zone was modeled consistently with the capacity for the
Baseline System serving that zone. (please guide me how to solve this
comment)

 

2.	Section G3.1.2.9 describes calculation used to determine the fan
power in the baseline building. Please list the total fan volume,
capacities, and fan power for the Baseline and Proposed system. (As my
system doesn?t have any Return fan, so i am dividing the ASHRAE total Fan
power by 70% supply, 20% return, 10% exhaust based on my understanding.
Please guide me if any changes required)

 

3.	Based on supporting document, supply fan volumes of some of the
zones in the baseline design appear to be modeled as ?AUTOSIZED?. For the
baseline design the fan supply volumes should be calculated based on the
system capacity and a temperature differential of 20?F, as set forth in
Section G3.1.2.8.(Please guide me Where can we enter the temperature diff,
is in Cooling Coil or any other ways.) 

 

Thanks & Regards,

Khan
